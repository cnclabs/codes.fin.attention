item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in millions except for ratios and per share data  unless noted otherwise this discussion should be read with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information for consistency with the current year presentation 
forward looking information forward looking information contained in this report is subject to risk and uncertainty 
we have made statements under the captions our business  risk factors  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this form k that are forward looking statements 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to investors 
however  there may be events in the future we are not able to predict accurately or that we do not fully control  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements  including changes in general economic and business conditions and in the insurance industry changes in our business strategies other factors discussed under risk factors and elsewhere summary the following section builds upon earlier discussion and provides more information about our company and our financial performance 
we are a property and casualty p c insurance company with headquarters in seattle  washington 
we sell insurance to drivers  home owners and owners of small and mid sized businesses through a national network of independent agents and brokers 
our business helps people protect what they value and deal with the unexpected 
our revenues come from the premiums we earn on the insurance policies we write and the income we earn from our investment of these premium dollars 
our financial results have been affected by the major strategic actions we have taken to reshape our business and become a more focused and successful competitor 
our major strategic initiatives included refining our business model increasing efficiencies for our independent agents and brokers meeting the needs of our customers at a fair price focusing on our p c operations effectively managing our capital 
table of contents refining our business model during  market conditions became more competitive 
through refinements to our business model  we continued to gain efficiencies that enabled us to grow profitably 
our market advantage is sustained by how we do business offering standardized auto  homeowners and small and mid sized commercial insurance products over a unified sales and service platform to meet the needs of our distributors and insurance consumers 
we focus on the personal and commercial insurance products purchased by the vast majority of us consumers 
we call these standardized products because they don t require significant customization  and they re well suited to automated underwriting and sales and service support 
our claims operation  with its front line experience and insight  is tightly aligned with our product development and underwriting teams 
we continually refine our segmented pricing models and accurately match rate to risk 
we deliver the majority of our products to our agents and brokers over our safeco now automated web based sales and service platform  which gives our distributors a single point of entry to sell our major p c products in a matter of minutes 
most of our pricing  underwriting and servicing processes are presented through this user friendly tool 
we sell our insurance products principally through independent agents and brokers who provide customers with choice and advice 
we motivate our distributors by giving them more to sell multiple lines of personal and commercial insurance  making it easier for them to sell through technology and other ease of business tools  helping them make more money selling our products through increased operational efficiencies and providing competitive compensation programs 
increasing efficiencies for our independent agents and brokers during and  we brought our major products together on safeco now  our automated web based sales and service platform 
safeco now features a single point of entry for personal auto  homeowners  most small commercial products and certain surety bonds 
products currently available on safeco now include auto  homeowners  dwelling fire  motorcycle  business owner policies  commercial auto  workers compensation and commercial multi peril 
we also launched our policy change tool for handling most personal lines endorsements online 
ninety eight percent of our personal lines policies are quoted and issued on safeco now  and of our personal lines policy endorsements are made online 
eighty percent of our commercial lines policies also are quoted and issued on safeco now 
meeting the needs of our customers at a fair price we offer competitively priced products using sophisticated multivariate underwriting models  which enable us to appropriately match price to risk 
we look at many variables to help predict future loss 
for example  in our homeowners product  we may consider the number of stories of a home  the number of mortgages  the credit score or how long the policyholder has been a homeowner  as well as other variables 
each of these factors  in combination with others  applies to pricing points  allowing for multiple pricing tiers and segmentation 
we analyze each of the characteristics in relation to one another multivariate segmentation which we believe allows us to match rate with risk at a finer level 
we focus on providing outstanding service by measuring ourselves against a zero defect standard in our service transactions 
we also have a team of more than  claims professionals across the country who deliver our most visible product the quality service and support we provide when customers experience a loss and file a claim 
our cost reductions in recent years and ongoing expense discipline help us provide competitively priced products 
focusing on p c operations during  we completed the sale of our life investments l i businesses 
four critical ideas led us to sell l i the low interest rate environment  limited investment returns and weakened l i earnings relative to our p c lines 
table of contents our belief that relentless focus on what we do best drives the greatest benefits for safeco and our shareholders competing in multiple insurance sectors increased the complexity of our business  which in turn increased our costs competitors of l i delivered better results  despite the adverse conditions affecting all players in the life and investments business effectively managing our capital during  we repurchased million shares  or  of our outstanding common stock at a total cost of under stock buyback programs 
we also repurchased in principal amount of our debt for  including transaction costs 
in  we used the majority of the  proceeds from the sale of l i to return our debt to capital ratios to pre sale levels and return excess capital to our shareholders 
specifically  we used  including transaction costs  to repurchase of debt  and we used to execute an accelerated stock buyback program of million shares 
we retained the balance of the sale proceeds for future flexibility and to pay transaction related expenses 
overall results our vision is to be one of the top performing insurance companies in the p c industry 
we measure the success of our strategy by tracking our performance against the following three financial indicators earnings per share return on equity revenue growth the following table shows the trends in these three key measures net income per diluted share net return on equity total revenues 
table of contents segment results how we report our results we manage our businesses in four business and seven reportable segments safeco personal insurance spi auto property specialty safeco business insurance sbi sbi regular sbi special accounts facility surety p c other in addition to the activities of these reportable segments  we report certain transactions  such as the interest expense we pay on our debt  debt repurchases  intercompany eliminations and miscellaneous corporate investment and other activities in our corporate segment and do not allocate these to individual reportable segments 
along with the sale of our l i businesses  all results related to l i are included in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
how we measure our results we look at three measures to assess the results of our business segments premiums underwriting profit or loss combined ratio written premiums are premiums charged for policies issued 
we view net written premiums as a measure of business production for the period under review and a leading indicator of net earned premiums 
we include insurance premiums in revenues as they are earned over the terms of the policies 
underwriting profit or loss is our net earned premiums less our losses from claims  loss adjustment expenses lae and underwriting expenses 
combined ratio is our losses  lae and underwriting expenses divided by our net earned premiums 
we report combined ratio as a percentage 
for example  a combined ratio of means that for every dollar of premium received  cents is spent on losses  lae and underwriting expenses  and cents is underwriting profit 
a lower combined ratio reflects better underwriting results than a higher combined ratio 
more information about our segment results can be found in the our p c operating results section on page 
table of contents investment activities are an important part of our business and represent a significant part of our total revenues 
we don t include our investment portfolio results when measuring the profitability of our individual segments because we manage them separately 
we invest the insurance premiums we receive in a diversified portfolio until they re needed to pay claims 
our first priority is to protect our policyholders  so we invest in a diversified portfolio of primarily high grade fixed maturities 
this strategy provides protection for our policyholders and a steady income for our shareholders 
our investment philosophy is to emphasize after tax investment income  balanced with investment quality and risk provide for liquidity when needed reduce volatility in investment performance through prudent diversification we measure our investment results in two parts the after tax net investment income we earn on our invested assets  and the net realized investment gains or losses we recognize when we sell or impair investments 
it is our intent to hold a diversified portfolio so we will achieve consistent investment performance 
more information about our investment results can be found in the our investment results section on page application of critical accounting estimates we have identified the accounting estimates listed below as critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
the application of these accounting estimates requires us to use judgments involving assumptions and estimates about future results  trends or other developments that could significantly influence our results if actual experience differs from those assumptions and estimates 
we review these judgments frequently 
an understanding of them may help readers to better understand our consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis md a 
we consider our most critical accounting estimates to be loss and loss adjustment expense reserves reinsurance recoverables valuation of investments loss and loss adjustment expense reserves our loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves reflect our estimates of the ultimate amounts for losses from claims and related settlement expenses that we have not yet paid to settle both reported and unreported claims 
we report these amounts in our loss and lae reserves on our consolidated balance sheets 
we record two categories of loss and lae reserves case basis reserves  and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves 
we estimate case basis reserves as the amount we will have to pay for losses that have already been reported to us but are not yet fully paid 
these amounts include related legal expenses and other costs associated with resolving and settling a particular claim 

table of contents we establish ibnr reserves at the end of every reporting period to estimate the amount we will have to pay for losses that have occurred  but have not yet been reported to us losses that have been reported to us that may ultimately be paid out differently than expected by our case basis reserves losses that have been paid and closed  but may reopen and require future payment expenses related to resolving and settling these losses we use actuarial methods combined with judgment to estimate ibnr reserves 
process and methodology for establishing loss and lae reserves the process for establishing loss and lae reserves differs for case basis versus ibnr reserves 
case basis reserves for reported losses  we establish a reserve estimate for each claim based on the known facts regarding the claim and the parameters of the coverage that our policy provides 
case basis reserves are adjusted as additional facts become available to us 
case basis reserves are reduced as we make payments for our reported claims 
ibnr reserves to establish our ibnr reserves  we use different approaches for current accident year losses prior accident years losses allocated loss adjustment expenses alae unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae these approaches exclude exceptional loss activity associated with catastrophic weather losses  non catastrophe weather losses and other large loss or salvage the amount we recover from property that becomes ours after we pay for a total loss  and subrogation our right to recover payments from third parties 
the methodologies used to establish ibnr reserves differ for the current accident year the year in which a claim occurs versus prior accident years 
the methodologies also differ for long tailed lines of business versus short tailed lines of business 
generally speaking  short tailed lines of business are those lines where the vast majority of claims from a particular accident year are both reported and settled within two years 
current accident year losses for short tailed lines of business  we use a ratio of ibnr reserves to earned premiums 
under this approach  an ibnr percentage is applied to current period earned premiums resulting in current period ibnr reserves 
for long tailed lines of business  we use an annual expected loss ratio approach 
under this approach  an expected loss ratio is applied to current period earned premiums resulting in an estimate of ultimate losses 
the resulting estimate of ultimate losses is reduced by the current period paid and case basis reserve activity  resulting in the current period ibnr reserves 
expected loss ratios and ibnr to earned premiums percentages are developed based on our analysis of prior accident years supplemented with data about changes in our book of business  changes in the external environment in which we operate  changes in our pricing and underwriting  and changes in our claims handling practices 
we review these ratios throughout the year  and we revise the expected loss ratio and ibnr percentage periodically based on these analyses 
changes in the selection of the expected loss ratio or ibnr percentage result in a change in the loss reserve estimate for the current year  which we report in current period earnings 

table of contents prior accident years losses for short tailed lines of business  the beginning ibnr reserves for prior accident years is adjusted for expected emerged losses to calculate ibnr reserves  absent an explicit determination to adjust ibnr reserves beyond this activity 
for long tailed lines of business  the beginning ibnr reserves for prior accident years is adjusted for paid and case basis reserve activity in the current period 
this yields ending ibnr reserves  absent an explicit determination to adjust ibnr reserves beyond this activity 
allocated loss adjustment expenses alae alae reserves represent an estimate of the claims settlement expenses that can be identified to a specific claim 
alae reserve estimates are generally established as a function of losses 
for some small lines  estimates of ultimate alae are established as a percentage of earned premiums 
these alae factors are established based on historical ratios supplemented for changes in our internal and external environments 
alae ibnr reserves are determined by subtracting paid and case basis activity from the ultimate alae estimate 
unallocated loss adjustment expenses ulae ulae reserves represent an estimate of the claims settlement expenses that cannot be identified to a specific claim 
ulae reserves are booked in aggregate for current and prior accident years combined 
in general  prior reserves are carried forward and supplemented with either a percentage of earned premiums or with a fixed dollar amount of additional reserves to account for growth in the line of business 
estimating loss and lae reserves estimating loss and lae reserves is a complex process because the ultimate losses are uncertain 
some claims will be paid out over a number of years  and there may be a significant lag between the time a loss occurs and the time it is reported to us 
we make significant judgments and assumptions about many internal variables and external factors 
examples of internal variables include changes in our claims handling practices changes in our business mix examples of external factors include trends in loss costs economic inflation judicial changes legislative changes regulatory changes these variables and factors affect the amounts we are ultimately required to pay for losses and related expenses 
as a result  it is not always possible to quantify their final impact on our future payments 
our process for arriving at our estimate of ultimate loss and lae is based on actuarial analysis and judgment 
it involves reviewing actuarial assumptions  holding discussions with claims and underwriting management  and considering changes in the internal and external environment 
because estimating reserves requires us to use assumptions and judgment  our actual future losses may differ from our estimates 
some actuarial techniques rely on our past loss and lae experience to estimate our future payments 
the changes we ve made in our business in recent years  however  also affect our future payments 
for instance  we have introduced new products  tightened our underwriting criteria and improved our claims handling practices 
as a result  we also consider these changes when estimating future payments 

table of contents for most of our lines of business  we use multiple estimation methods that vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated to establish our estimate of ultimate losses 
our estimate of ibnr reserves is the difference between our projection of ultimate losses and the payments we have made and case basis reserves we have established for those losses 
our analyses are applied to historical claim activity and experience  supplemented with data about changes in our book of business  changes in the external environment in which we operate  changes in our pricing and underwriting policies  and changes in our claims handling practices 
the standard actuarial methods we use include paid loss development historical payment patterns for prior claims are used to estimate future payment patterns for current claims 
these patterns are applied to current payments by accident year to yield expected ultimate losses 
incurred loss development historical case incurred patterns paid losses plus case basis reserves for past claims are used to estimate future case incurred patterns for current claims 
these patterns are applied to current case incurred by accident year to yield expected ultimate losses 
average claim value and claim count development loss payment and or case incurred amounts are divided by the number of claims to generate average costs per claim 
using historical patterns  the expected ultimate average cost per claim by accident year is projected 
separately  the expected ultimate number of claims is projected by accident year 
the product of the expected ultimate average cost per claim and the expected ultimate number of claims yields expected ultimate losses 
expected loss ratio loss ratios are developed for recent accident years based on historical accident year loss ratios adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and current rate levels 
the expected loss ratio for each accident year is then applied to the actual earned premiums to calculate expected ultimate losses 
bornhuetter ferguson this approach blends the expected loss ratio method with either the paid or incurred loss development method 
both methods are used with weights applied to each of them based on the maturity of the accident year 
as an example  if the current accident year for personal automobile bodily injury is estimated to be paid  then the paid loss development method would receive a weight of  and the expected loss ratio method would receive a weight 
we use many of the above methods to estimate reserves for each product line 
the merits of each method are evaluated given the facts at hand 
an estimate of the ultimate losses is then made based on the particular method or combination of methods deemed most appropriate 
for example  if a particular line has been subject to significant changes in claims handling practices that would impact the comparability of case basis reserves between periods  we would give little or no credibility to the incurred loss development approach 
there is uncertainty in our estimates of ultimate losses 
this uncertainty can stem from such factors as irregular claim reporting and payment patterns and changes in our mix of business 
we consider this uncertainty by looking at historical claim patterns by line of business and by examining our historic reserve accuracy 
for each line  we consider expected volatility when estimating and recording reserves 
the various assumptions  estimates and other factors that may have an impact on our ultimate losses are discussed with management to determine our best estimate of ultimate losses and lae  and our estimate of ibnr reserves is then recorded 

table of contents we use range analyses only as a retrospective view to test whether previously established estimates for reserves for our lines of business are reasonable  using subsequent information 
our estimate of our ultimate loss and lae reserves is subject to change as additional data emerge 
this could occur as a result of the emergence of exceptional loss activity an actuarial study the emergence of internal variables or external factors that would alter our view in general  we review our reserves quarterly 
this review includes either an actuarial analysis involving the application of standard actuarial techniques or the review of the paid and incurred activity in the quarter relative to the assumptions from our previous actuarial analyses 
in addition  special studies are undertaken periodically for certain lines of business or exposures 
we segregate the activities of estimating losses for product pricing purposes from those of determining reserves to be reported in our financial statements 
the chief risk officer has the ultimate responsibility for the independent determination of appropriate reserves 
estimating our loss and lae reserves is an ongoing process 
our loss and lae reserves represent our best estimate of the ultimate future payments associated with losses and related expenses  giving consideration to the uncertainties inherent in the estimates 
we record any adjustments to these reserves in the periods in which we change the estimates 
we report changes to these reserves in our consolidated statements of income 
catastrophe and non catastrophe weather loss reserves are established by event by the claims department when the event occurs 
these estimates are revised as the actual loss experience develops and claims are reported and settled over time 
we reduce our reserves by the amounts we expect to recover from salvage and subrogation 
we accrue salvage and subrogation recoveries on an individual case basis for large claims 
we use actuarial techniques to estimate the amount for small claims 
we may determine that certain loss or salvage subrogation activity is beyond the scope of what was anticipated in the initial establishment of loss reserves 
in that case  we would adjust ibnr reserves to directly reflect this activity 
other considerations we do not discount any of our reserves to present value 
we purchase reinsurance to limit our exposure to potential large losses 
we report the amounts we expect to recover from reinsurers as reinsurance recoverable assets on our consolidated balance sheets

table of contents loss and lae reserve variability loss and lae reserves are subject to variability  particularly the ibnr component 
for the lines of business we write  variability in the frequency the average number of claims filed  or severity the average cost of a claim is generally a function of one or more of the following factors payout period lines of business involving claims that stay open for long periods are subject to greater reserve variability 
this is driven by the difficulty in estimating future economic  social and legal trends that impact both the time that such claims remain open and their future costs 
size of the reserve balance slight variations in large reserve balances can generate significant financial volatility 
policy limits lines of business involving policies with high or unlimited policy limits are subject to greater variation 
policy deductibles lines of business involving excess policies with large deductibles  or policies that provide coverage for claims that exceed the policy limit of an underlying policy  are subject to greater variability 
the existence of large policy deductibles considerably increases the lag between the occurrence of a claim and the time it is reported to us 

table of contents safeco personal insurance spi spi loss and lae reserves are estimated using standard actuarial methods and judgment 
these methods involve analyzing past claims experience for recent changes in business claims practices and the internal and external environments 
emphasis is placed on evaluating claims reporting and closing patterns  as well as the size of loss payments and case basis reserves 
spi losses and related expenses are analyzed by line of business  product  coverage and geographic area 
auto policies provide coverage for bodily injury  uninsured motorists  personal injury protection  medical payments  property damage  and comprehensive and collision losses 
in arriving at our estimates  we consider our changing mix of business as our business grows  we write more policies in markets where we have not written significant business previously 
we continue to write a higher proportion of standard and non standard risks than we have historically 
these risks have  on average  higher frequencies and lower severities than preferred risks 
our increase in new business new business generally has higher claim frequencies than business that has been on the books for longer than one year general inflation and medical cost trends bodily injury bi coverage represents the largest portion of our loss and alae reserves held for auto 
small variations from our assumptions can yield significant financial volatility given the magnitude of these reserve balances 
to illustrate the sensitivity of our estimate  a one point increase in our severity assumption for auto bi would yield an increase of approximately in the estimated reserve 
our property and specialty lines are predominantly short tailed business  and most claims are reported and settled within months 
we use standard actuarial techniques and judgment to estimate reserves for those lines 
safeco business insurance sbi and p c other sbi primarily writes commercial multi peril  property  workers compensation  commercial auto and general liability insurance for small to mid sized businesses 
p c other is composed of large commercial business and other businesses we have placed in runoff 
our sbi and p c other segments have exposure to asbestos and environmental losses primarily from policies we no longer write 
these segments also have exposure to construction defects losses and related expenses through the general liability  commercial multi peril and umbrella coverages they provide 
these exposures and the risks they present are discussed in aggregate for sbi and p c other as they are estimated by product and like exposure

the table excludes ulae reserves  which were at year end  at year end and at year end december loss and alae payments reserves at year end  before reinsurance earned premiums claims number of claims reported claims in the year open claims at year end 
table of contents factors in estimating loss reserves for workers compensation estimating reserves for workers compensation involves a significant degree of uncertainty and judgment 
this is driven by long payout periods workers compensation claims can remain open years or more  introducing variability in the ultimate length of the payout 
the cumulative effect of inflation trends over time  particularly medical cost inflation  can be significant 
unlimited liability nature of workers compensation policies many claims can payout for the lifetime of the claimant with no limit on the total payment amount 
changes in future benefit levels legislative actions and judicial interpretations can affect the cost of future benefits 
increases in life expectancy increases in life expectancy increase both the length of future payments and the cost of treatment 
claim reporting lags some claims are not made immediately  as a result  we remain exposed to workers compensation losses arising from policies written years ago 
changes in our business changes in our claims handling practices  changes in our writings of large versus small to mid sized accounts  and changes in the mix of states where these policies are written can affect our ability to predict ultimate payout based on historical data 
in determining our best estimate for workers compensation reserves  long term medical cost inflation trends over the average claim payout period represent our most significant assumption 
we have assumed that double digit medical cost inflation will continue in the near term  moderating over time to historical levels 
our best estimate of workers compensation reserves presents risk of unfavorable reserve development should medical inflation trends not abate 
a one point increase in our estimate of the average medical cost severity trend would yield an increase of approximately in our estimated reserves 
other commercial products excluding commercial liability products  which are discussed below  the payout periods for our other commercial products  primarily commercial auto and commercial property  are relatively short 
as a result  our estimated loss reserves for these products are subject to less volatility than our workers compensation reserves 
we use standard actuarial techniques combined with judgment to estimate these loss reserves 
commercial liability products our commercial multi peril policies  business owners policies  general liability and commercial umbrella policies provide third party liability coverage to our policyholders 
estimating reserves for third party liability involves a significant degree of uncertainty and judgment 
this is driven by long payout periods many third party liability claims are paid years after the occurrence of the loss 
as a result  the cumulative effect of inflation can be significant 
claim reporting lags some claims are not made immediately  as a result  we remain exposed to losses arising from policies written years ago 
changes in coverage interpretation legislative actions and judicial interpretations can affect the cost of future payments 

table of contents changes in our business changes in our claims handling practices  changes in our writings of large versus small to mid sized accounts  and changes in the mix of types of business can affect our ability to predict ultimate payout based on historical data 
these factors give rise to latent claim emergence and evolving coverage precedents for claims regarding such things as asbestos  environmental and construction defects 
we discuss each of these claim types in further detail below 

table of contents asbestos this table shows our loss and alae reserves for asbestos related claims 
the table excludes ulae reserves  which were at year end  at year end and at year end december loss and alae payments  before reinsurance loss and alae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance three year survival ratio  gross three year survival ratio  net claims and average costs open claims at end of year average paid per closed claim average case reserve per open claim number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 
in this table  the three year survival ratio represents the number of years our current loss reserves would last if future payments are made at the same average annual rate experienced over the last three years 
the three year survival ratio is equal to our loss reserves  divided by our average annual payment over the last three years 
due to volatility and the sparseness of data  estimating loss reserves for asbestos claims requires more than standard actuarial techniques 
as a result  we analyze and consider claims statistics and trends  directional trends in survival ratios  and applicable law and coverage litigation 
our asbestos liability exposure here s the breakout of our asbestos loss reserves  net of reinsurance relates to our runoff assumed reinsurance operations and our exposure to syndicates and pools 
relates to our direct exposure 
accordingly  we ve established two separate special claims handling functions  one that specializes in asbestos claims related to our runoff assumed reinsurance operations  and one that specializes in asbestos claims related to our direct exposure 
our exposure through our runoff assumed reinsurance operations is primarily excess of loss reinsurance 
pools are groups of insurers that enter into agreements to share exposure related to specific insureds 
our loss reserve estimates for pools reflect the loss reserve estimates provided by the pools independent actuaries 
the loss experience of our runoff assumed reinsurance operations follows the general industry trend 
our direct exposure is primarily due to smaller and more peripheral entities becoming defendants in asbestos claims 
our exposure to the major high profile asbestos defendants is limited for our direct business 
this stems from our historical business strategy to not write direct coverages for larger companies 
in addition  we do not have direct exposure to businesses that are the subject of settlement agreements 

table of contents our ibnr reserves were of our loss and alae reserves for asbestos claims at december  and at december  we categorize our policyholders with active asbestos claims in two groups according to their exposure large asbestos accounts our policyholders with cumulative loss payments exceeding  as of december  small asbestos accounts our policyholders with cumulative loss payments of less than  as of december  these tables provide details about our policyholders and losses paid related to asbestos loss reserves december  number of policyholders net paid net asbestos reserves of asbestos reserves assumed reinsurance and pools loss and alae policyholders with active claims large asbestos accounts loss small asbestos accounts loss total loss total alae ibnr total december  number of policyholders net paid net asbestos reserves of asbestos reserves assumed reinsurance and pools loss and alae policyholders with active claims large asbestos accounts loss small asbestos accounts loss total loss total alae ibnr total 
table of contents estimating loss reserves for asbestos estimating loss reserves for asbestos claims requires more judgment than our other lines of business 
that s primarily because past claim experience may not be representative of future claims 
several factors make it difficult to predict future asbestos claim payments 
they include insufficient data inherent risk of major litigation diverging legal interpretations regulatory actions legislative actions increases in bankruptcy proceedings non impaired claimants being allowed to make claims efforts by insureds to seek coverage interpretation not subject to aggregate limits changes in these factors could result in future asbestos claims payments that are significantly different from those currently predicted 
in estimating our loss reserves for asbestos claims  we consider applicable law and coverage litigation analyze claim statistics and trends review industry information to test the reasonableness of our reserves do not consider ongoing congressional reform efforts some asbestos related claims are subject to non product liability coverage rather than product liability coverage 
non product liability coverage may not be subject to policy aggregate limits  resulting in higher asbestos claims payments and related expenses 
environmental this table shows our loss and alae reserves for our liability coverages related to environmental claims 
the table excludes ulae reserves  which were at year end  at year end and at year end december loss and alae payments  before reinsurance loss and alae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance three year survival ratio  gross three year survival ratio  net claims and average costs open claims at end of year average paid per closed claim average case reserve per open claim number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 

table of contents our environmental claims exposure our environmental claims result from our runoff assumed reinsurance operations and our commercial general liability line that we write on a direct basis 
we generally have avoided writing coverages for large companies with substantial exposures to environmental claims 
as a result  our average environmental claim tends to be small 
our ibnr reserves were of our loss and alae reserves for environmental claims at december  and at december  in  we reached a settlement on a large number of environmental claims related to coverage on general liability policies written for individual gasoline stations 
under these policies  there was a petrochemical company named as an additional insured 
we have settled all claims with the additional insured 
this global settlement and future indemnification agreement is included in our payment activity 
we have no other reported claims of this nature 
other payments in reflect year to year volatility in claim and payment activity 
in  our loss payments returned to levels more in line with our historical experience 
our relatively limited environmental claims activity results in fluctuations in average values from period to period 
the average paid closed environmental claim increased compared with due in part to a general liability settlement relating to contaminated land on a single private development project 
additionally  average payments were unusually low in and due to the above mentioned settlement reached on a large number of individual environmental claims related to coverage on general liability policies written for individual gasoline stations 
estimating loss reserves for environmental the volatility of actuarial estimates of liabilities for environmental claims is often greater than that of other exposures 
this is due to several factors including insufficient data changes in the number and types of defendants involved with these claims unresolved legal issues  including existence of coverage  definition of ultimate damages and final allocation of damages due from the financially responsible parties in light of these factors  we estimate loss reserves for environmental claims including consideration of claim statistics and trends directional trends in survival ratios applicable law and coverage litigation industry data 
table of contents construction defects this table shows our loss and alae reserves for construction defects claims 
the table excludes ulae reserves  which were at year end  at year end and at year end december loss and alae payments  before reinsurance loss and alae payments  net of reinsurance reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance claims and average costs open claims at end of year average paid per closed claim number of claims and whole dollars  net of reinsurance 
our construction defects claims exposure our exposure to construction defects claims comes from general liability and commercial multi peril coverages we provide to contractors 
construction defects claims result from alleged defective work performed in the construction of large structures that include apartments  condominiums and large developments of single family dwellings or other housing 
construction defects claimants often seek payment for damages resulting directly from the alleged defective construction work and diminished economic value of the structure meaning that the structure has less market value because of the alleged defective construction work 
construction defects claims are complex  with an inherent difficulty in determining fault 
most of our claims are concentrated in a small number of states  particularly california 
our ibnr reserves were of our loss and alae reserves for construction defects claims at december  and at december  
table of contents we have taken a number of actions to mitigate our exposure to construction defects claims  enabling us to vigorously defend our coverage position 
they include stricter underwriting standards a separate claims handling function and internal legal counsel specializing in construction defects claims relationships with external legal counsel specializing in construction defects claims estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims the main factors in estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims are changing legal and regulatory environments statutes of limitations and statutes of repose in filing these claims diminished value claims involvement of multiple plaintiffs  defendants and insurers long periods between the actual construction work and the date the claim is reported the uncertainty created by these factors requires more judgment in estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims than for our other lines of business 
we use techniques developed specifically for estimating loss reserves for construction defects claims 
with these techniques  we estimate the number of future claims and the average value of every claim and make adjustments for anticipated changes in coverage interpretations  regulations  judicial rulings  plaintiff attorney involvement and changes in our book of business 
over the last three years  our number of open construction defects claims has decreased steadily an average drop of per year 
our loss reserve estimates assume that the number of open claims will continue to decrease  but at a slower rate 
surety our surety bonds insure construction performance  as well as legal matters that include appeals  probate cases and bankruptcies 
by their nature  surety claims result in lower loss frequency and higher loss severity than most of our p c products 
in addition  surety claims provide us with substantial opportunity for salvage and subrogation  the nature and extent of which vary from case to case 
to estimate loss reserves for surety  we examine actuarial analysis large claim analysis reinsurance terms and conditions individual insured exposure analysis analysis of salvage and subrogation potential our surety loss and alae reserves  net of salvage and subrogation recoveries  were at december  and at december  surety reserves fluctuate from period to period due to the lag between the time payments are made on a claim and the time we receive salvage and subrogation amounts

for example as shown in section a  our loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance at year end were  after years  we ve actually paid  section c shows our revised loss and lae reserve estimates through the years 
for example as shown in section a  our reserves net of reinsurance at year end were  section c shows the annual reestimation of those reserves  and after years our revised reserves were  
table of contents section d shows the cumulative redundancy or deficiency developed through the years 
a redundancy occurs when our reserves exceed our actual loss experience  and a deficiency occurs when our reserves are less than our actual experience 
for example as shown in section a  our loss and lae reserves net of reinsurance at year end were  after one year those reserves developed a redundancy  and after years the redundancy grew to this is the difference between the reserves shown in section a net of reinsurance  and the reestimated amounts in section c 
our analysis of losses and lae reserve development table shows these trends favorable development in reserve estimates from through unfavorable development in reserve estimates from through favorable development in reserve estimates from through the favorable trend from through was primarily due to loss and lae reserves that were ultimately conservative benefits from establishing specialized claims handling units for construction defects  asbestos and environmental exposures  and fraud investigations favorable workers compensation legislation in the early s moderation in medical costs and inflation during the period the unfavorable trend from through was primarily due to significant increases in workers compensation medical costs legislative and regulatory developments higher than expected number of construction defects  asbestos and environmental losses the favorable development from and was primarily due to lower than expected number of claims in our auto and property segments lower than expected number of claims in commercial auto and liability lower than anticipated losses related to the world trade center lower than expected number of claims in construction defects in the analysis of losses and lae reserve development table  all amounts include the effects of changes in amounts for prior periods 
conditions and trends that affected our loss and lae reserves in the past may not occur in the future 
for example  substantial reduction in our large commercial insurance and program business in will disproportionately affect trends in these tables for several years 
as a result  our analysis of losses and lae reserve development table is not a basis for estimating future redundancies or deficiencies

table of contents reinsurance recoverables on page  we provided an overview of how we use reinsurance 
here  we focus on how we estimate reinsurance recoverables 
the reinsurance we buy limits our losses on certain individual risks and reduces our exposure to catastrophic events 
we purchase reinsurance from several reinsurers and are not dependent upon any single reinsurer 
reinsurance recoverables are the amounts our reinsurers owe us related to the losses we have incurred 
we reported at december  and at december  in reinsurance recoverables as assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the increase in our reinsurance recoverables in is a result of estimated reinsurance recoveries related to workers compensation and hurricane katrina losses 
determining reinsurance recoverables requires us to make estimates because we do not know the exact amount due from the reinsurer until all our underlying losses are settled 
the amount of reinsurance recoverables varies depending on the size of individual losses and the aggregate amount of losses in particular lines of business 
to estimate reinsurance recoverables  we review estimates of large losses that are covered under reinsurance agreements review reinsurance recoverable amounts for specific claims as well as for lines of business compare our estimates with past reinsurance recoverables perform actuarial analyses of loss development above and below our retention levels the amounts we absorb before the reinsurers reimburse us specified under our reinsurance agreements examine actuarial data with and without reinsurance recoverables estimating an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables we regularly review our reinsurance recoverables to determine the collectibility of what is owed to us 
in doing that  we review historical collection experience reinsurance recoverables associated with individual reinsurers  including large exposures and those with lower rated reinsurers reinsurance recoverables concentrated with a particular event or issue for example  a large loss  a catastrophe or an emerging claim issue trends in default rates by credit rating our estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was at december  and at december  valuation of investments our investments include fixed maturities and marketable equity securities  which we report at fair value as available for sale securities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fixed maturities we invest in include bonds  mortgage backed securities and redeemable preferred stock 
the marketable equity securities we invest in include common stock and non redeemable preferred stock 
how we determine other than temporary declines in the value of our investments we regularly review the fair value of our investments 
invested assets are subject to various risks  such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
periodic changes in fair values of our investments are reported as a component of 
table of contents accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the operating results of any period until we sell the security or when declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
if the fair value of any of our investments falls below our cost or amortized cost basis in the investment  we analyze the decrease to determine whether it is an other than temporary decline in value 
to make this determination for each security  we consider how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its amortized cost the current financial condition and future prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings potential our intent and ability to keep the security long enough for it to recover its value any downgrades of the security by a rating agency any reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments based on our analysis  we make a judgment as to whether the decline is other than temporary 
sometimes  an investment decline we consider temporary in one quarter can become other than temporary in a future quarter 
if the decline is other than temporary  we report an impairment charge within net realized investment gains in our consolidated statements of income in the period we make that determination 
we reported impairment charges of in  in and in determining the fair value of our investments for the majority of our investments  we use available public market price information to determine the fair value 
when such information is not available  as is the case for securities that are not publicly traded  we use other valuation techniques 
these techniques include using independent pricing sources  including brokers evaluating discounted cash flows identifying comparable securities with quoted market prices based on industry sector  credit quality and maturity using internally prepared valuations based on certain modeling and pricing methods more about our investments can be found in the our investment results section on page

income from discontinued operations was in reconciling segment results the following table assists in reconciling our gaap results  specifically the income from continuing operations before income taxes line from our consolidated statements of income to our operating results year ended december p c corporate income from continuing operations before income taxes the gaap results are further described using our segment measures  which provide a helpful picture of how our company is doing 
however  using them to measure profitability while fairly common in our industry is not consistent with gaap 
our p c operating results the primary measures of our operating results include our premiums  underwriting profit or loss and combined ratios 
the following tables report those key items by our reportable segments for the last three years 
more information about the results  also by reportable segment  follows the tables 
first  premiums are the primary driver of our revenues  along with net investment income and net realized investment gains 
net written premiums are a non gaap measure representing the amount of premium charged for policies issued with effective dates during the period 
premiums are reflected as revenue in the consolidated statements of income as they are earned over the underlying policy period 
net written premiums 
table of contents applicable to the unexpired term of a policy are recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated balance sheets 
we view net written premiums as a measure of business production for the period under review and a leading indicator of net earned premiums

driving our results we ve achieved growth and underwriting profitability in our auto business through our segmented auto insurance product underwriting and pricing discipline ease of doing business segmented auto insurance product our segmented auto insurance product offers up to underwriting tiers 
these underwriting tiers are further refined using multivariate models to assess the risk of loss based on many factors  and provide a more accurate price for a wider range of risks 
during  we launched an updated underwriting and pricing model for our auto product 
the primary change involves using our own vehicle groupings known as rating symbols based on our experience and data rather than industry vehicle rating symbols  allowing us to vary some of our deductibles 
this updated model  now in place in of the states where we write auto business  further increases our sophistication and accuracy in our underwriting and pricing  giving us greater precision in matching rate for each risk 
underwriting and pricing discipline in  we experienced a more competitive marketplace as many insurers achieved strong underwriting results 
competitors increased marketing and advertising for new auto insurance customers 
we also have seen rate decreases by competitors in some states and loosening of underwriting standards 
we continue to adhere to our disciplined underwriting standards and pricing in this environment 
ease of doing business our commitment to ease of doing business continued through further development of our safeco now automated underwriting platform  which lowers our agents costs and provides an easy to use  web based sales and service platform 
our auto product is available on safeco now in all of the states where we write auto business 
in and  we enhanced our safeco now platform to streamline the service process for distributors and auto customers so that our agents and brokers can efficiently handle most auto policy changes and endorsements online

this was in part due to the impact of medical costs inflation on bodily injury claims and a slight shift in business mix to states with higher bodily injury severity claims over the past months 
this also was partly due to the effect of our increased average deductible  which has eliminated some low severity losses that are not reported because they are less than the now higher deductible amounts 
the impact of the increase in severity was partially offset by the effect of a low single digit decrease in frequency the average number of claims filed 
these factors  net of reinsurance  increased our combined ratio by points in compared with in  the impact of loss cost changes increased our combined ratio by points compared with prior year reserve development our underwriting results in included favorable prior year reserve development of and in included favorable prior year reserve development of  reflecting decreases in severity estimates for prior accident years across liability lines compared with our original estimates

table of contents catastrophe losses we categorize catastrophes as events resulting in losses greater than per event and involving multiple claims and policyholders 
we cannot accurately predict when catastrophes may occur  and the number and type of catastrophes can vary widely 
the losses they cause may significantly exceed our prior experience 
catastrophes can be caused by natural events  such as hurricanes  tornadoes  wildfires  earthquakes and hailstorms or other factors such as terrorism  riots  hazardous material releases or utility outages 
pretax after reinsurance catastrophe losses were in compared with in and in the higher catastrophe losses increased the combined ratio by points in compared with the lighter catastrophe losses in decreased the combined ratio by points compared with expenses the increase in our expense ratio of points in compared with was driven by increased investment in technology and bad debt expense related primarily to non standard policies  partially offset by decreased agent commissions resulting from slower growth and earned premium increases due to average premium changes 
in  the decrease in our expense ratio by points compared with was the result of our expense improvement efforts  primarily as a result of the corporate restructuring initiatives 
this was partly offset by higher bonus commission and employee performance bonus expenses due to our growth and improved underwriting results 
where we re headed we anticipate the following factors will impact our growth and profitability in the near future competitive environment we believe competition in the auto segment will continue through mass market advertising  higher agency compensation and lower prices 
we will maintain our underwriting discipline and will not compete for business for which we cannot obtain our long term target margins 
while maintaining our discipline  we will be relentless in seeking ways to profitably grow our business during this competitive cycle 
we carefully monitor our rates and offer our distributors choices in the area of compensation so they can match compensation to their business model 
we also are committed to managing our expenses  as we recognize that our competitors are doing the same 
underwriting segmentation our segmented auto product offers up to underwriting tiers using multivariate models to assess the risk of loss based on many factors  providing a more accurate price for a wider range of risks 
going forward  we expect to further refine our underwriting and pricing models 
this continuous process will provide increasing precision in matching rate for each risk 
ease of doing business we believe that the combination of our ongoing product development through underwriting segmentation and continued improvements in our ease of doing business through safeco now will allow us to continue to build profitable growth in the face of increasing competition 
we believe that having more verifiable data available at the point of sale  such as motor vehicle reports  police reports and credit reports will make our application process smoother 
we anticipate the change in average premium will be in the low single digits in  with rate increases targeted to specific segments of our business 
business growth as our business grows  we may write more policies with standard and non standard risks  which have  on average  higher frequencies than preferred risks 
however  preferred auto business will still remain our largest book of business and continue to be our greatest area of opportunity 
we will continue to grow into eastern states where we currently have less geographic presence 
we also will focus on the changing nature of the independent distribution channel through new agency appointments and customized business approaches 
finally  we will continue to study the purchasing behaviors of insurance consumers to be certain we are meeting their needs

these underwriting tiers are further refined using multivariate models to assess the risk of loss based on many factors and provide a more accurate price for a wider range of risks 
this increased segmentation means we are better able to align rate with risk  producing greater pricing precision 
it also means we can grow by offering coverage to more home owners

continued catastrophe management we continue to actively manage our exposure to catastrophe risk through a combination of risk avoidance  risk mitigation and risk transfer strategies

historically  this business is more price competitive as industry profit margins expand 
we remain committed to disciplined pricing and underwriting based on loss cost trends  and we intend to meet our profit margin targets 
we will further compete in this segment through our field specialization model  continued focus on agent relationships and our retention efforts through distinctive customer service 
we also will continue to emphasize ease of doing business through product and service expansion on safeco now 
service capabilities in  we will provide our agents and brokers with self service capabilities for as much as of their business  up from today 
agents will be able to initiate policy change requests electronically on safeco now  with real time quoting and processing for a majority of these transactions 
the billing and payment processes will be accessible through a web based tool  where both agents and customers will have quick access to billing information and a variety of electronic bill payment options 
agents will also be able to turn off receipt of paper output and access policies and forms electronically and have the ability to route policies and other policy related output from us directly to customers 
expense management we expect to further reduce our expense ratio as we make productivity enhancements by providing more capabilities on our safeco now platform  including self serve policy change transactions as well as other overall improvements in efficiency 
business growth given the increasing number of small businesses in the united states and the lack of a dominant market leader  we see growth potential in this segment 
our goal is to be the leading small business insurance writer in the independent agency channel 
we will continue to appropriately match rate with risk through segmentation and disciplined underwriting 
we will charge prices that will allow us to achieve our target profit margins  and we will decline to write business when pricing or risk factors do not allow us to earn our target returns

impact of terrorism the terrorism risk insurance extension act of tria extends the requirement of insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage to certain commercial policyholders  including workers compensation policyholders 
under the extension  tria now excludes automobile  burglary and theft  surety  professional liability and farm owners multi peril insurance 
although tria excludes professional liability insurance from the commercial policies required to offer terrorism coverage  it explicitly retains directors and officers liability insurance 
us government funding under tria  the us government will provide funding to the insurance industry if a terrorist attack is certified as such by the secretary of the treasury in concurrence with the secretary of state and attorney general of the united states 
the criteria for certification include the act is 
table of contents dangerous to human life  property or infrastructure  and is committed by an individual or individuals on behalf of any foreign person or foreign interest 
the extension adds a program trigger 
under this new provision  insurers will not be compensated unless the aggregate industry insured losses from a certified act of terrorism  occurring after march   exceed in and in subject to the program trigger  the us government s share is of the certified losses in excess of individual insurance company deductibles in program year and decreases to in year 
tria determines the deductibles for insurance companies as a percentage of their direct earned premiums 
our estimated deductible for is terrorism exclusions prior to the enactment of tria  our policies excluded losses due to foreign terrorism in states that had approved the exclusions 
for tria covered policies  we do not exclude losses due to foreign terrorism unless the policyholder rejects our mandatory offer of terrorism coverage 
the insurance services office iso created coverage and pricing tools to help insurers respond to the tria requirements 
if the policyholder does reject our mandatory offer of terrorism coverage  we can then exclude coverage for losses due to foreign terrorism 
the iso has filed exclusions for acts of terrorism as defined by tria  and we have adopted those filings 
however  some states limit the use of terrorism exclusions 
reinsurance options the availability of terrorism reinsurance is limited in the commercial reinsurance market 
our current reinsurance program provides limited terrorism coverage 
all reinsurance treaties exclude certified terrorist acts and also non certified terrorist acts involving nuclear  chemical  biological or radioactive materials 
treaties providing both certified and non certified terrorist acts include our workers compensation reinsurance program and our commercial umbrella reinsurance program 
our property catastrophe treaty provides non certified terrorism coverage for of above the first of loss 
our exposure is modest we believe our exposure to potential terrorism losses is relatively modest across all our product lines 
with commercial insurance  our focus is on small to mid sized businesses generally not viewed as likely potential terrorism targets 
similarly  with workers compensation policies  the number of employees covered is a key consideration 
we decline to provide coverage in cases where we believe the exposure is potentially severe to terrorism 
with our personal lines of insurance  we believe that losses due to terrorism would be relatively modest 
we believe that exposure and risk to individuals are small

the payments we make to policyholders depend upon losses they suffer from accidents or other unpredictable events that are covered by insurance 
although we estimate how much cash we ll need and when we ll need it based on prior experience and the mix of business we write  we cannot predict all future events  particularly catastrophes 
so we invest most of our money in high quality liquid securities investments that can quickly be turned into cash to support our projected or potential need for liquidity

our cash flow from continuing operations for the past three years was year ended december cash and cash equivalents beginning of year net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash and cash equivalents end of year the increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily due to cash received from insurance premiums of billion in  billion in  and billion in  and lower insurance claims paid of billion in  billion in and billion in  reflecting our improved underwriting results

we purchased the shares from a dealer at a price of per share  for a total cost of  including transaction costs 
through the repurchase program we returned excess capital to shareholders and immediately reduced the number of our common shares outstanding 
the dealer obtained the shares that we repurchased by borrowing them in the open market  and then purchased shares in the market over time to repay the borrowed shares 
we completed the repurchase program in november  receiving a price adjustment of based on the average price of shares purchased 
we reported the price adjustment as an increase to shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we executed a rule b trading plan to purchase up to an additional of our outstanding common stock 
this plan allowed us to repurchase our shares during periods when we would normally not be active in the market because of our own internal trading windows

this facility replaced our three year facility  which expired in september the terms of the bank credit facility which runs through march require us to pay a fee to have these funds available maintain a specified minimum level of shareholders equity keep our debt to capitalization ratio below a specified maximum the bank credit facility does not require us to maintain any deposits as compensating balances 
at the end of and throughout  we had no borrowings under the bank credit facility and we were in compliance with all its covenants 

table of contents our contractual obligations our contractual obligations at the end of were payment by total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest operating leases pension and other retirement obligations purchase obligations subtotal loss and lae reserves total loss and lae reserves represent our best estimate of losses from claims and related settlement costs 
because of the nature of insurance policies  there is typically no minimum contractual commitment associated with covered claims 
both the amounts and timing of such payments are estimates  and the inherent variability of resolving claims as well as changes in market conditions make the timing of cash outflows uncertain 
therefore  the ultimate amount and timing of loss and lae payments could differ from our estimates 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements

a number of state legislatures and insurance regulatory agencies have enacted laws and regulations that limit the use of credit information in the underwriting process 
additional states are considering doing so 
our p c businesses use insurance scoring  which is partially based on credit information in making risk selection and pricing decisions 
limitations or prohibitions on the use of credit information could negatively affect our p c business plans 
dividend payments from our subsidiaries our insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to safeco corporation 
we then use that money to pay dividends to our shareholders as well as to make principal and interest payments on our debt 
individual states limit the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries domiciled in those states can pay safeco corporation 
exceeding such limits would require prior regulatory approval 
in the aggregate in  our insurance subsidiaries can pay up to in dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
these amounts are according to the limits states had in place at the end of risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state regulators use risk based capital rbc formulae to identify companies that are undercapitalized and that may merit further regulatory attention or action 
our insurance subsidiaries have more than sufficient capital to meet rbc requirements 

table of contents income taxes at december   we had of gross deferred income tax assets 
gross deferred income tax assets are composed of temporary differences created as a result of amounts deductible for taxes in future periods 
such temporary differences relate primarily to unrealized gains on investments and differences in the recognition of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  deferred policy acquisition costs  goodwill and unearned premiums 
although realization of deferred income tax assets is not assured  we believe they will be realized through future earnings  including but not limited to the generation of future operating income  reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies 
accordingly  we have not recorded a valuation allowance for these assets 
more information on income taxes can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
pension plans our pension obligations resulted from the defined benefit pension plan we sponsor covering substantially all employees 
more information can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
amounts recorded for our pension obligation and pension cost are affected by assumptions used to calculate them  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
to calculate our benefit obligation  as of december   we used a discount rate assumption of based on consideration of the general interest rate environment  the calculation of an equivalent discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed maturities with future cash flows that are similar to the timing and amount of our estimated future pension benefit payments and other relevant factors 
to calculate pension cost for the year ended december   we used a discount rate assumption of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption of 
we determined the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption by considering the mix of investments within the plan  the expected future investment performance of those asset sectors  actual investment experience during the lifetime of our plan and other relevant factors 
a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would result in an increase of in pension cost in a decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would result in an increase of in pension cost in new accounting standards a discussion of new accounting standards can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures for financial instruments this table shows the fair values of certain of our financial instruments on our consolidated balance sheets at december  and to analyze the sensitivity of our financial instruments to changes in interest rates and equity prices  we show in the second column in the table for each year the effect a basis point increase in market interest rates would have on the fair values 
in the third column for each year we show the effect a decline in equity prices would have on fair values fair value increase decrease in asset or liability fair value increase decrease in asset or liability december change in interest rates change in equity prices change in interest rates change in equity prices financial assets fixed maturities marketable equity securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate swaps financial liabilities notes due notes due notes due notes due debentures due interest rate swaps market risk is our potential loss from adverse changes in interest rates and equity prices 
in addition to market risk  we are exposed to other risks  including credit risk related to our investments underlying insurance risk related to our core businesses the sensitivity analysis used for the table summarizes only the market risk related to our recorded financial assets and liabilities 
we seek to maintain a laddered maturity portfolio of fixed income investments with reasonable average durations 
we keep sufficient cash and short term investments to provide for the liquidity needs of the operating companies 
in our fixed income allocation  we try to maximize after tax income without sacrificing investment quality or assuming too much interest rate and call risks 
in our equity portfolio  we invest in a diversified group of high quality companies providing us with portfolio diversification  capital appreciation and dividend income 
we calculate the estimated fair values at the adjusted market rates by using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling  where appropriate 
the adjusted market rates assume a basis point  simultaneous  parallel increase in market interest rates 
this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed above 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in this sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited because it does not consider any actions we could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates and equity prices 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis excludes certain non financial instruments such as insurance liabilities 
accordingly  any aggregation of the estimated fair value amounts or adjusted fair value amounts does not equal the underlying fair value of net equity
