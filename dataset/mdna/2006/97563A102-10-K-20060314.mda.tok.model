the hotel ownership segment and hotel financing segment revenues for the year ended december   were million and million  respectively 
the hotel ownership segment and hotel financing segment assets as of december   were million and million  respectively 
hotel ownership the company s hotel ownership segment s primary source of revenue is room revenue generated from hotels it either wholly owns or owns an interest in through joint ventures 
the company also generates revenue through food and beverage  telephone  parking  and other incidental sales at its hotels 
operating expenses consist of the costs to provide these services as well as corporate general and administrative costs  real and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance costs  income taxes of our consolidated taxable reit subsidiary  depreciation  amortization  and other costs 
the company has significant fixed costs associated with owning and operating hotels  which do not necessarily decrease when market factors cause a reduction in revenue for the property 
as a result  changes in revenue per available room revpar can result in a greater percentage change in the company s earnings and cash flows 
the company uses several key indicators to evaluate the performance of its hotel ownership business  primarily revpar  operating margin and ffo 
revpar  or revenue per available room  is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is determined by multiplying average daily rate adr actual daily revenue at a hotel divided by the total number of rooms sold by occupancy percentage for any given period 
revpar does not include food and beverage or other ancillary revenues  such as parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
throughout  strong economic growth in the united states economy combined with improved business demand led to revpar growth throughout the lodging industry 
our revpar increased from to due to improving market conditions 
operating margin is determined by dividing gross operating profit  for the hotels  by total revenue 
our operating margins decreased slightly to from in the same period for the previous year 
ffo and ffo available to common shareholders are also supplemental industry wide measures of reit operating performance 
for  ffo available to common shareholders decreased to million compared to million for the company evaluates these measures in light of unusual events during the years to make a normalized comparison for purposes of comparability 
excluding the effects of non cash impairment charges and non cash income tax expense benefits in both years  as well as non recurring items in both years including the effects of the redemption of the series a preferred stock in  the non recurring lease agreement acquisition income earned in  and the additional interest income relating to the early payoff of the cornhusker  baltimore  tampa and kauai hotel loans in  ffo available to common shareholders would have been million for versus million for hotel financing the company s hotel financing segment generates interest income from hotel loans that it originates or acquires 
during  the company issued five hotel loans totaling million and four hotel loans  totaling million were paid off early 
as of december   the company had nine loans outstanding  representing loans receivable totaling million and interest receivables totaling approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not hold an ownership interest in any of the hotels for which it has provided financing 
the company plans to continue to expand its hotel lending business in the future 
the company s hotel loan program is designed to provide loans to the hotel industry  primarily by either originating single loans  purchasing participations or subordinate pieces of loans originated by others or through the purchase of the first loss piece of collateralized mortgage backed securities cmbs transactions  which typically contain multiple hotel properties 
the first loss piece is collateralized by the respective underlying hotels and is not securitized 
however  the company may also issue whole loans and then potentially sell the senior portion of the loan 
the company s loan amount is typically to of the project s all in cost  ranging from approximately million to approximately million 
the company will primarily provide financing between and of the lesser of the project s all in cost or fair market value 
loans will typically be issued for hotels with between and rooms 
we continue to seek additional prudent financing opportunities where the company can capitalize on its hotel underwriting and development expertise 
the company expects to use a portion of the availability under its million line of credit the ge line with general electric capital corporation gecc  the million repurchase agreement with marathon structured finance fund  lp marathon and other financings to provide loans to the hotel industry 
strategy and forecasted operating conditions based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions  our key priorities or financial strategies include  among other things improving results at our hotels 
the company seeks to direct our hotel managers to increase revenues and minimize operating costs 
forecasts for the lodging industry continue to be favorable and the company believes the improving trends in the lodging industry create the opportunity for improvements in the operating results of its hotels in the company also implements selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability consistent with franchisor standards and mandates 
during the year ended december   the company spent million for capital improvement at  its hotels 
the company expects total capital expenditures for improvements during of approximately million  including approximately million for franchisor mandated items 
improving our hotel portfolio 
the company is focused on acquiring hotels with a favorable current yield and an opportunity for appreciation 
during  the company acquired six marriott branded hotels  the hampton inn suites in baltimore s inner harbor and a percent ownership interest in the stanley hotel in estes park  colorado 
the company focuses on acquiring additional hotels  or ownership interests in hotels  with strong national franchise affiliations or hotel properties with the potential to obtain these franchise affiliations in the full service  extended stay  mid scale without food and beverage  upscale  and upper upscale market segments 
the company also has the in house capability to develop hotels 
in  the company began construction on four hotels at an expected total cost of an aggregate of approximately million 
the company expects two to open in  and the other two to open early the company was also designated a preferred developer for the new select service aloft brand by starwood and is currently reviewing several potential development sites on which it can build and own aloft branded hotels 
as the cost of building a new hotel in many markets is now comparable to  or lower than  prices for existing hotels the company is continually looking to develop additional hotel properties 
the company intends to sell older  underperforming hotels or hotels that the company believes no longer meet the company s yield objectives and investing the funds in selected hotel development  acquisitions of hotels and hotel loans 
during  the company sold three hotels for aggregate net proceeds of million 
the company recorded a million net of allocation to minority interest non cash impairment charge in the third quarter relating to two hotels 
on november   the company s board of directors adopted a formal plan to sell the two hotels 
accordingly  both of these hotels are classified as assets held for sale on the company s consolidated balance sheet and are included in discontinued operations on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
should the company complete a sale of these hotels  there can be no assurance that the net proceeds from sale will equal the company s carrying value  in which case an additional impairment charge may be necessary at that time 
expanding our hotel loan program

other matters critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its hotel guests and loan borrowers to make required payments 
the company reviews its accounts receivable aging report on a monthly basis and discusses the status of receivable collections with appropriate hotel personnel to determine if additional allowances are necessary 
notes receivable 
it is the policy of the company to maintain an allowance for individually impaired hotel loans based on management s best estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date 
a hotel loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due interest as well as principal according to the contractual terms of the hotel loan agreement 
the specific reserves are determined on a hotel loan by hotel loan basis based primarily on management s best estimate of the company s exposure  given the current payment status of the hotel loan  the borrower s ability to pay  the operating results and value of the underlying hotel 
the company reviews the operating results of each hotel underlying its loans 
the company also analyzes the operating results of the hotel to determine whether or not the estimated market value of the hotel exceeds the total debt outstanding on the property 
if the financial results of the respective hotels were to deteriorate  allowances may be required 
if a hotel loan were deemed to be impaired  the company would record a reserve for hotel loan losses through a charge to income for any shortfall 
to date  no such impairment charges have been recognized 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for hotel loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations 
accounting for long lived assets general 
the company evaluates the potential impairment of its individual long lived assets  principally its wholly owned hotel properties and the hotel properties in which it owns an interest through consolidated joint ventures in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment in hotels has been impaired  such that the company s estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  together with its estimate of an anticipated liquidation amount  would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the hotel property  or when the company classifies a property as held for sale and the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
the company considers many factors and makes certain subjective assumptions when making this assessment  including but not limited to  general market and economic conditions  operating results over the past several years  the performance of similar properties in the same market and expected future operating results based on a variety of assumptions 
changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could adversely impact the company s assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and estimated liquidation amounts therefore requiring an immediate material impairment charge 
further  the company currently owns certain hotels for which the carrying value exceeds current market value 
other than the impairment charge discussed below  the company does not believe an impairment charge for these hotels is appropriate at this time since the company s forecast of future undiscounted cash flows  including an anticipated liquidation amount  exceeds the current carrying value 
should the company approve a plan to sell any of the hotels for which the carrying value exceeds fair market value  an impairment charge would be required at that time  and could be material in the aggregate 
impairment on planned dispositions 
the company prepares an impairment analysis quarterly based on facts and circumstances existing at the end of each quarter 
during the third quarter of  management began evaluating the potential sale of certain hotels 
accordingly  the company factored in the prospect of selling properties in the near term 
as a result of this analysis  which was prepared on a probability weighted  estimated undiscounted future cash flow basis  an impairment was triggered under a held for use model for two hotels 
in accordance with sfas  the company recorded a million net of allocation to minority interest non cash impairment charge in the third quarter relating to the two hotels 
the non cash impairment charge represents an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of the two hotels to the estimated sales prices  net of estimated costs to sell 
the company s estimated sales price is based on fair market value quotes received from independent brokers 
on november   the company s board of directors adopted a formal plan to sell the two hotels  for which impairment charges were taken during the third quarter 
accordingly  both of these hotels are classified as assets held for sale on the company s consolidated balance sheet and are included in discontinued operations on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
should the company complete a sale of these hotels  there can be no assurance that the net proceeds from sale will equal the company s carrying value  in which case an additional impairment charge may be necessary at that time 
asset retirement obligation 
fin clarifies that future expenses to remove environmental contaminates  including asbestos containing materials acms from buildings should be estimated and accrued as a liability at the time of acquisition with an offset to increase the cost of the associated structure 
the company currently owns four hotels in which acms were identified 
the acms are appropriately managed  in accordance with current environmental laws and regulations 
the company used an expected cash flow approach to measure its obligations with respect to future remediation costs 
amounts were calculated using current information  current assumptions  and current interest rates 
while management uses the best information available to establish its asset retirement obligation  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the calculation of the obligation see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for joint ventures the company evaluates its investments in joint ventures for impairment by considering a number of factors including assessing current fair value of the investment to carrying value 
if the current fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value  and there is either an absence of an ability to recover the carrying value of the investment  or the property does not appear to have the ability to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment  an impairment charge may be required 
franchise agreements the company s franchisors periodically inspect the company s hotels to ensure that they meet certain brand standards primarily pertaining to the condition of the property and its guest service scores 
as of december   the company was in default at six hotels for product improvement issues and low guest service scores 
one of the defaults is the second in a row for the hotel and therefore it must maintain a passing rating for the next two years 
if the hotel receives a third default during this time  the franchisor may choose to terminate the franchise agreement 
the company is currently in the process of curing these deficiencies to comply with the respective franchisor s standards  and although the company expects to receive an acceptable rating for each of these hotels  it can provide no assurance that an acceptable rating will be received for such hotels 
the failure by the company to cure defaults at multiple properties and the subsequent terminations of franchise agreements by its franchisors could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements and or results of operations 
as of december   of the company s hotels were operated under franchise licenses 
the franchise agreements provide for termination at the franchisor s option upon the occurrence of certain events  including the company s failure to pay royalties and fees or perform its other covenants under the franchise agreement  bankruptcy  abandonment of the franchise  commission of a felony  assignment of the franchise without the consent of the franchisor  or failure to comply with applicable law or maintain applicable standards in the operation and condition of the relevant hotel 
the franchise agreements will not renew automatically upon expiration 
the hotels franchise licenses  including six joint venture hotels  expire as follows year of expiration number of hotels year of expiration number of hotels the company has recently received written notification from two franchisors that the franchise license agreements for three of its hotels  which expire in november  january and march  will not be renewed 
in september  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge relating to two hotels 
on november   the company s board of directors adopted a formal plan to sell the two hotels  including one for which the franchise will not be renewed 
regarding the other two hotels  the company may decide to change the brand of the hotels prior to the expiration date 
this situation is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
there can be no assurance that other licenses will be renewed upon the expiration thereof 
such future non renewals could have a material adverse effect on the company 
recently issued accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in thousands as of december   the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on its ge line and other variable rate debt 
the company s interest rate risk objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for a portion of its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
the company may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or caps and treasury options or locks to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
as required by the extension of the ge line  on september   the company  through spe ii  entered into an interest rate cap agreement to eliminate the exposure to increases in day libor day libor was at december  over on principal balances up to million outstanding 
this interest rate cap agreement terminates on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the definitive extent of the company s interest rate risk under the ge line and other variable rate debt is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
if interest rates increased by basis points  the company s interest expense for the year ended december  would have increased by approximately million  based on the weighted average amount of variable rate debt outstanding and exposed to fluctuations in the market rate of interest 
the following tables provide information at december  and about the company s interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
the tables present principal cash flow by expected maturity dates for the fixed and variable rate debt 
the table also includes estimates of the fair value of the company s interest rate risk sensitive instruments based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues
