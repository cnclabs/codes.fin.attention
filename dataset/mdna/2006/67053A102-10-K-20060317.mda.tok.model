overview numerex corp is a wireless machine to machine communications  technology and solutions business 
the company combines its network services  products and applications development capabilities to create innovative packaged and custom designed machine to machine offerings for customers across multiple market segments 
fiscal year represented a marked improvement over prior periods 
full year revenues of almost million increased million or from nearly all of this increase came from our wireless division where revenues grew compared to gross margins for were compared with in this was due to strong acceleration in wireless data product sales which typically earn a lower margin than that generated by service revenue 
these product sales  however  should result in enhanced recurring service revenue in subsequent periods 
for fiscal year overheads  which include selling  general and administrative costs as well as research and development expenses and bad debt costs  collectively were million or less than higher than for in fact  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses have shown no significant increase in absolute terms in the last three years while total revenues have increased more than 
sg a expenses  which represented over of revenues in  were less than in as a result of strengthening revenues  a minimal decrease in gross margins and continued control over costs  we recorded a million improvement in net income in  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  to a profit of almost thousand for the comparative period in numerex s balance sheet also shows similar improvement in for example  cash balances at december  were almost million compared to million at december  in addition  because of principal repayments and conversions to equity  our total debt has been reduced from million at december  to million at december  subsequent to december  the million of debt at year end has been converted to equity and therefore eliminated 
this event favorably impacts our cash flow due to reduced principal repayments and interest expense  which we believe further solidifies our financial strength 
the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and and this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of numerex s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories and the adequacy of reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  accounting for income taxes and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we primarily sell products  recurring services most billed on a monthly basis and on demand services 
product revenues are recognized at the time title passes to the customer  which in most cases is at the time of shipment 
we bill most of our recurring service revenues on a monthly basis  which are generated by providing customers access to our wireless machine to machine communications network the network 
we sell these services to retailers and wholesalers of the service 
for services sold to retailers  monthly service fees are generally a fixed monthly amount billed one month in advance 
we defer the advance billing for the service and recognize the revenue when the services are provided 
for services sold to wholesalers  the customers are billed a fixed base fee in advance and usage fees in arrears at the end of each month 
again  we defer the advance billing of the base fee and recognize the revenues when the services are performed 
we also provide services on a demand basis 
these types of services are generally completed in a short period of time usually less than one month and are billed and the revenue recognized when the services are completed 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is estimated based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where information exists that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these cases  we use our judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that customer to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  we establish a general reserve for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change  ie higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be changed by a material amount 
inventories and reserves for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventory and identify  with estimates  potential future excess  obsolete and slow moving inventories 
we specifically identify obsolete products for reserve purposes and analyze historical usage  forecasted production based on demand forecasts  current economic trends  and historical write offs when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for excess and slow moving inventory 
if we are not able to achieve our expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current carrying value  we would adjust our reserves accordingly 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our long lived and intangible assets and goodwill are subject to annual impairment tests  which require us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value 
the impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill and intangible assets had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill or intangible assets that we believed was impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
net goodwill and intangible assets amounted to million as of december  deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
historically  we have recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance in an amount equal to our net deferred tax assets 
if we determine that we will ultimately be able to utilize all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been provided  the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
beginning in fiscal year  management will begin to evaluate the deferred tax valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
result of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain revenue and expense items and the percentage increases and decreases for those items in the company s consolidated statements of operations

substantially all of this increase is attributable to a million increase in product and service sales in wireless data communications in  partially offset by a million decrease in digital multimedia and networking product sales 
cost of product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of higher product sales volume in the wireless data communications and wireline  partially offset by lower digital multimedia and networking product sales 
cost of services increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of higher service sales volume in wireless data communications  digital multimedia and networking and wireline 
cost of sales depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of assets in our digital multimedia and networking division becoming fully depreciated during gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the gross profit percentage decreased slightly in because product sales as a percentage of total sales increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  since product sales entail higher costs of sale  gross profit as a percentage of sales is generally less on product sales than service sales  and so the increase in product sales in resulted in a slight decrease in the total gross profit percentage 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the period ended december  versus the comparable period in was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to some assets in digital multimedia and networking becoming fully depreciated during selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue for the year primarily because our revenues increased while these costs essentially remained flat 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased primarily due to the reclassification of certain personnel to research and development from selling  general and administrative positions 
we expect research and development costs to continue at current levels 
bad debt expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the comparable period 
bad debt expense continued to decrease during as a result of our implementation of more stringent credit policies and collections processes in operating expense depreciation and amortization expense remained constant at million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  interest expense net decreased to  in from  in this decrease was primarily the result of reduced interest expense on a note held by the laurus master fund laurus initially issued on january  in the amount of million 
on july  we voluntarily converted million of the outstanding debt associated with the note into  shares of our common stock 
on august  we converted the remaining outstanding portion of the debt associated with the note into  shares of our common stock 
as a result  we have reduced our total interest expense 
the majority of ongoing interest expense is related to a second  note that we issued to laurus on january  please see note a to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about our transactions with laurus 
foreign currency loss decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of decreased foreign currency loses on sales to canadian customers 
as discussed in note f to our consolidated financial statements  we are entitled to the benefits of certain net operating loss carry forwards 
however  we believe it is unlikely that we will utilize the deferred tax items  therefore  we have not recorded a federal tax benefit for the year ended december  the  provision for income taxes for the year ended december  is related to certain state income taxes 
the  income tax expense for the year ended december  is related to certain state and foreign income taxes 
basic and diluted earning loss per common share increased to earnings of per share for year ended december  as compared to a loss of per share for the year ended december  weighted average and diluted shares outstanding increased to  at december  from  at december  this increase is primarily due to our issuance of million shares to laurus in connection with the conversion of our million note  as discussed above 
fiscal years ended december  and december  net revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in total net revenues for the year ended december  is attributable to a increase in total product sales and an increase in service revenue 
most of the product sales and service revenue increase for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  was in digital multimedia and networking and wireless data communications in the amount of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in wireline security product sales and service revenue of  cost of product sales increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of higher product sales volume in the wireless data communications and digital multimedia networking  which were partially offset by lower wireline product sales 
we also experienced an increase in the cost of our wireless services products during the year ended december  versus the same periods in we have identified alternative sources of these products that we believe should defray some of these increases in future periods 
cost of services increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of services for the twelve months ended december  versus the same period in was primarily the result of higher service revenue volume in wireless data communications and higher service revenue volume in digital multimedia and networking 
additionally  we received a one time credit against network service provider costs that occurred in quarter ended june  that did not occur in cost of sales depreciation and amortization expense decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the sale of the assets relating to datasource  which was sold in september gross profit  as a percentage of net revenue  was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the total gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the same period in because product sales were of total revenue for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  since  gross profit as a percentage of revenue is generally less on product sales than for service revenue  the increase in product sales versus service revenue decreased the total gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
the decreases in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the twelve months period ended december  versus the same period in were partially offset by a reduction of depreciation expense due to the sale of the assets relating of datasource 
selling  general  administrative and other expenses increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general  administrative and other expenses decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  selling  general  administrative and other expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue for the year primarily due to reductions in personnel in our mobile guardian division 
research and development expenses remained constant at  for the year ended december  we expense research and development costs and expect such costs to continue at current levels 
bad debt expense decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  bad debt decreased during the period as a result of the implementation of more stringent credit policies and collections processes as well as an improvement in general economic conditions 
operating expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this was due to some older assets becoming fully depreciated while we have had a limited requirement for the purchase of new equipment 
net interest expense increased to  in compared to  for the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of interest expense on the  convertible note payable to laurus master 
this convertible note payable replaced the  note payable to cingular 
the note payable to laurus master fund has a higher effective interest rate than the cingular note payable  however  the laurus note has a longer term 
we issued the note payable to cingular on march   thus the twelve month period ended december  had approximately nine months of interest expense  while the laurus master fund note payable was issued by us on january   therefore  the twelve month period ended december  had approximately eleven and a half months of interest expense 
gain on the sale of business of  for the twelve month period ended december  was due to the receipt of a contingent payment in march on the sale of datasource in september since a contingency associated with the sale was favorably met 
the gain on the sale of business of  twelve month period ended december  was attributable to the sale of datasource 
foreign currency loss of  for the year ended december  versus a gain of  was mostly the result of foreign currency loses on sales to canadian customers 
we did not utilize the deferred tax items so we have not recorded a federal tax benefit for the year ended december  the  for the twelve month period ended december  is related to certain state and foreign income taxes 
the  in income tax expense for the twelve month period ended december  is related to our operations in australia and certain state income taxes 
we recorded a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  basic and diluted loss per common share increased to for year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   which includes the gain on the sale of datasource 
the weighted average and diluted shares outstanding decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in weighted average basic shares outstanding for the twelve month period ended was primarily due to our repurchase on march  of  shares of our common stock held by cingular 
this was partially offset by shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan

the increase in wireless data communications product sales of million for the year ended december  versus the same period in was primarily the result of increased sales of our vehicle security products and tracking services  mobileguardian and increased sales of our uplink security devices used for wireless communications between alarm installations and central monitoring stations 
the increase in the wireless data communication services revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of connections to our cellemetry wireless network 
connection increases were generated by sales of our security products as well as those generated by value added resellers who utilize the cellemetry network to provide customer solutions 
we continue to focus on increasing connections to our network due to the recurring nature of service revenues 
net revenue from digital multimedia and networking decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in product sales to million  primarily due to decreased sales of our interactive videoconferencing products powerplay directly or indirectly as a subcontractor to distance learning customers 
capital spending by targeted distance learning customers is largely funded by government entities and  as a result  is difficult to predict and can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the decrease in product sales was offset by an increase in digital multimedia and networking service revenues  which increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period in most of this increase was due to substantial increases in sales of integration and installation services 
installation and integration services are primarily  either directly or indirectly  provided to large wireline and wireless telecommunication companies 
while service revenues have increased for the year  we cannot predict whether telecommunications customers will maintain their current level of capital expenditures 
net revenues from wireline security increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to a increase in product sales to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this increase in product sales is due to sales of maintenance parts to a customer in australia with which we have an equipment supply agreement  as discussed further below 
fiscal years ended december  and december  net revenues from wireless data communications increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net revenues was the result of a increase in product sales and a increase in service sales compared to the prior year 
the million increase in wireless data communications product sales of for the year ended december  versus the same period in was primarily the result of increased sales of our new wireless vending machine monitoring product vendview and in our vehicle security products and tracking services  mobileguardian 
the vendview product was only introduced in the fourth quarter of product sales also increased due to higher demand for uplink security devices used for wireless communications between alarm installations and central monitoring stations 
the increase in the wireless data communication services was primarily due to an increase in the number of connections to our cellemetry wireless network 
these increases were achieved even though we sold our short messaging service datasource in september connection increases were generated by sales of our security products as well as those generated by value added resellers who utilize the cellemetry network to provide customer solutions 
net revenues from digital multimedia and networking increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily due to a increase in product sales to million  primarily due to increased sales of our interactive videoconferencing products powerplay directly or indirectly as a subcontractor to distance learning customers 
in addition  digital multimedia and networking service revenues increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period in most of this increase was due to substantial increases in integration and installation services 
installation and integration services are primarily  either directly or indirectly  provided to large wireline and wireless telecommunication companies 
wireless carrier demand for these services can fluctuate dramatically in response to an environment of increasing customer demand for their services while at the same time they attempt to control their own capital expenditures 
there was a significant increase of installation and integration services by the wireless carriers in the second and third quarter of as a result of government mandated provision of emergency services by the end of this year 
net revenues from wireline security decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  most of the wireline product sales in were the sales of maintenance parts to a customer in australia with which we have an equipment supply agreement the agreement 
pursuant to the agreement  in may  we shipped  of wireline security detection equipment to the customer  in exchange for a share of the customer s future revenues 
although  under the agreement  the customer retains title to this equipment following its acceptance  it must meet certain obligations under the agreement  or pay amounts specified in the agreement 
since the actual revenue that will be generated by the sale of the equipment was uncertain at december   we did not recognize revenue on the equipment sale as of that date 
during the twelve month period ended december  there was sales of maintenance parts to the customer that were not made pursuant to the agreement 
the sale price was fixed and payable in accordance with our normal terms and conditions 
accordingly  we recognized revenues from the sales of the maintenance parts to the customer in the twelve month period ended december  and the customer completed installation of the wireline security detection equipment in december we received our first share of revenues from the services in the third quarter of selected quarterly financial data the following tables detail certain unaudited financial data of numerex for each quarter of the last two fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
our financial results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of certain factors related to our business  including the timing of product shipments  new product introductions and equipment  and product and system sales that historically have been of a non recurring nature

net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this million improvement was partially due to an increase in net earnings to  from a operating loss in the increase was also due to an increase in accounts payable of million  partially offset by an increase in notes receivable of  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to a short term investment in commercial paper as well as the addition of tangible and intangible assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to proceeds from the note payable we issued to laurus in january  partially offset by principal payments on both of the laurus notes of  and principal payments on capital lease obligations of  cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was primarily from the proceeds of the note payable issued to laurus in january  partially offset by principal payments on this note of  and principal payments on capital lease obligations of  our business has traditionally not been capital intensive and  accordingly  capital expenditures have not been material 
to date  we have funded all capital expenditures from working capital  capital leases and other long term obligations  and the proceeds from notes payable we have issued 
we paid principal and interest of approximately  on our notes payable during the twelve months ended december  laurus opted to convert  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for principal payment on our notes during the twelve months ended december  we voluntarily converted  of the outstanding debt associated with the laurus note issued in january into  shares of our common stock during the twelve months ended december  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from operations  will be more than sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
this belief could be affected by unexpected operating losses  a material adverse change in our operating business or a default under our outstanding notes payable 
we continually consider other sources of funding  including the sale of certain non core assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of inflation inflation has not been a material factor affecting our business 
in recent years the cost of electronic components has remained relatively stable  due to competitive pressures within the industry  which has enabled us to contain our manufacturing and operations costs 
our general operating expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits  and facilities costs are subject to normal inflationary pressures  but to date inflation has not had a material effect on our operating results 
foreign currency our functional and reporting currency is the us dollar 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not  and are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or liquidity
