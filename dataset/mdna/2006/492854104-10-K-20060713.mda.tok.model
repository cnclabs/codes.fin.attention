managements discussion and analysis introduction we are a recognized leader in the design  manufacture  and installation of laboratory and technical furniture products 
laboratory furniture products include both steel and wood cabinetry  fume hoods  flexible systems  and worksurfaces 
technical furniture products include workstations  workbenches  computer enclosures  and network storage systems 
our headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in statesville  north carolina 
we also have subsidiaries in singapore and bangalore  india that serve the asian markets 
although only approximately of our sales were through our international subsidiaries in fiscal year  these sales are considered an important part of our long term growth strategy 
our products are primarily sold through purchase orders and contracts submitted by customers through our dealers and commissioned agents  a national distributor  and through competitive bids submitted by us and our subsidiaries 
products are sold principally to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  industrial  chemical and commercial research laboratories  educational institutions  healthcare institutions  governmental entities  manufacturing facilities  and users of networking furniture 
we consider the markets in which we compete to be highly competitive  with a significant amount of the business involving competitive public bidding 
it is common in the laboratory furniture industry for customer orders to require delivery at extended future dates  as products are frequently to be installed in buildings yet to be constructed 
changes or delays in building construction may cause delays in delivery of the orders and our recognition of the sale 
since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry  we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between receipt of an order and delivery of the product 
the impact of such possible increases is considered when determining the sales price 
the principal raw materials and products manufactured by others used in our products are cold rolled carbon and stainless steel  hardwood lumbers and plywood  paint  chemicals  resins  hardware  plumbing and electrical fittings 
such materials and products are purchased from multiple suppliers and are typically readily available 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition a portion of our product sales result from fixed price construction contracts that involve a signed contract for a fixed price to provide our laboratory furniture and fume hoods for a construction project 
we are usually in the role as a subcontractor  but in some cases may enter into a contract directly with the end user of the products 
product sales resulting from fixed price construction contracts are generated from multiple element arrangements that require separate units of accounting and estimates regarding the fair value of individual elements 
our multiple element arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting are product sales and installation services 
each of these elements represent individual units of accounting as the delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered items  and arrangements normally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered item 
we determine fair value based on the price of the deliverable when it is sold separately or based on third party evidence 
in accordance with the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we use the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration when the arrangement does not indicate fair value of the product sale 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met  we recognize revenue for product sales at the date of shipment 
product sales resulting from purchase orders involve a purchase order received by us from our dealers or our stocking distributor 
this category includes product sales for standard products  as well as products which require some customization 
these sales are recognized under the terms of the purchase order which generally are freight on board fob shipping point and do not include rights of return 
accordingly  sales are recognized at the time of shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves management judgments and estimates 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  or a project dispute makes it unlikely that all of the receivable owed by a customer will be collected  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded  to reduce the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  a general reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the majority of inventories is measured on the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold  and  therefore  recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw materials  and other inventoriable costs more quickly than other methods 
other inventories consisted of foreign inventories and are measured at actual cost 
pension benefits we sponsor pension plans covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
in february  our pension plans were amended as of april  no further benefits will be earned under the plans subsequent to the amendment date  and no additional participants will be added to the plans 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate used to calculate and determine benefit obligations and expected return on plan assets within certain guidelines 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may significantly affect the amount of pension income or expense recorded by us in future periods 
results of operations sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from fiscal year sales of million 
domestic demand for our products improved during the year 
domestic sales were million  an increase of over the prior year 
although demand for products improved  a significant amount of excess manufacturing capacity remained in the marketplace 
domestic selling prices for laboratory products declined during the year  as manufacturers reacted to the excess manufacturing capacity 
growth accelerated for our asian subsidiaries during the year  as sales through our international subsidiaries increased to million 
sales for fiscal year were million  a decrease of from fiscal year sales of million 
domestic sales were million  a decrease of from the prior year  while sales through our international sales decreased to million 
sales for fiscal year  both domestic and international  were adversely affected by several factors during the year 
spending for new research projects by pharmaceutical companies was reduced by the uncertainties surrounding the november presidential election and the potential impact of its outcome on pricing of prescription drugs 
the significant increases in the cost of construction materials during fiscal year reduced the number of laboratory projects generally available in the marketplace  or delayed construction 
spending for laboratory construction for higher education science buildings slowed significantly during fiscal year due to the combination of significantly higher construction costs and reduced state funds available for these projects 
our order backlog was million at april   as compared to million at april   and million at april  gross profit represented   and of sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit margin in fiscal year from fiscal year was due to a number of unfavorable factors 
these included lower selling prices  increased costs of raw materials  particularly steel and epoxy resin  and increased costs of energy and transportation 
we only had limited success in our efforts to pass on these added costs to customers 
the unfavorable factors were partially offset by actions taken to reduce factory overhead  manufacturing costs  and material costs 
the increase in gross profit margin in fiscal year from fiscal year was due to aggressive activities to reduce overhead and material costs 
these improvements more than offset significant increases in raw material prices  particularly steel and epoxy resin  which reduced gross profit for the year by million  or of sales 
other operating income of  in fiscal year resulted from the sale of our former plant site in lockhart  texas 
operating expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively  and   and of sales  respectively 
the decrease in operating expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily attributable to cost reduction activities during the current year  the full benefit of workforce reductions made during the prior year  a decrease in pension expense of  resulting from the freezing of benefits in our pension plans as of april   and a reduction in bad debt expense of  on a dollar basis  operating expenses for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year benefited from cost reduction activities  including reduced salaries and benefits of  resulting from workforce reductions made during the year 
operating expenses in fiscal year also benefited from a decline in sales commissions of  as compared to the prior year due to the lower sales volumes 
as a percent of sales  operating expenses in fiscal year increased as compared to fiscal year as the amount of operating expenses did not decline proportionately with the decline in sales 
other income was   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
other income for fiscal year includes  received during the year from the resolution of a disputed claim for laboratory furniture sold several years earlier 
interest expense was   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increased interest expense in fiscal year resulted primarily from higher interest rates paid 
the increased interest expense in fiscal year resulted from higher interest rates paid  partially offset by lower levels of borrowings 
income tax expense of  or of pretax earnings was recorded in fiscal year the impact of earned state and federal tax credits in fiscal year was offset by a valuation allowance established against earned but unused tax credits  since the utilization of these tax credits depends on future taxable income 
an income tax benefit of  or of the pretax loss was recorded in fiscal year an income tax expense of  or of pretax earnings was recorded in fiscal year the effective rate for fiscal years and differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of earned state and federal tax credits 
the effective rate for fiscal year was also impacted by the level of the pretax losses 
minority interest related to our two subsidiaries that are not owned by us were   and  for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the changes in minority interest for each year were due to changes in the net income of the subsidiaries 
net earnings in fiscal year were  or per diluted share 
a net loss of  or per diluted share  was reported for fiscal year net earnings in fiscal year were million  or per diluted share 
net earnings in fiscal year were increased by  resulting from the sale of our former plant site in lockhart  texas 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have historically been funds generated from operating activities  supplemented as needed by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  certain machinery and equipment are financed by non cancelable operating leases or capital leases 
we believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to support ongoing business requirements  including capital expenditures  through fiscal year at april   we had advances of million outstanding under an unsecured million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility matures in december  and we intend to replace it with a new facility prior to the maturity date 
during fiscal year  we entered into a year operating lease for a new distribution center in statesville  north carolina 
this lease arrangement  as well as most of our leases for machinery and equipment  provides us with renewal and purchase options and certain early cancellation rights 
in fiscal year  we began a project to purchase and install a new enterprise resource planning system erp 
the project is projected to have a total cost of million and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal year we have entered into lease arrangements to fund the majority of the expected costs of the project as costs are incurred 
costs of  and  for the project were incurred and funded under operating and capital lease arrangements during fiscal years and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the obligated cash payments including interest if applicable for the above commitments as of april  payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years after years operating leases capital leases total contractual cash obligations we do not have any off balance sheet obligations at april  operating activities used cash of  in fiscal year operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal year and used cash of  in fiscal year and the primary uses of cash during fiscal year were increases in inventory and accounts receivable balances offset by cash provided from operating earnings and an increase in accounts payable 
operations along with a reduction in accounts receivable and inventory were the primary sources of cash in fiscal year the primary use of cash in fiscal year was to fund the significant increase in receivables  which was partially offset by funds provided from operating earnings and a reduction in inventory 
the majority of the april  accounts receivable balances are expected to be collected during the first quarter of fiscal year  with the exception of retention amounts on fixed price contracts which are collected when the entire construction project is completed and all retention funds are paid by the owner 
we made cash contributions of million and  to our pension plans in fiscal years and  respectively 
as discussed above  no further benefits will be earned under the plans after april   and no additional participants will be added to the plans 
we did not make any contributions to the plans in fiscal year and do not expect to make any contributions to the plans in fiscal year capital expenditures were million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were funded primarily from cash generated by the sale of our property in lockhart  texas 
capital assets related to the erp system in the amount of  were funded under capital leases in fiscal year capital expenditures in fiscal year were funded primarily from cash generated by operating activities 
capital assets related to the erp system in the amount of  were funded under capital leases in fiscal year capital expenditures in fiscal year were funded primarily from borrowings under our credit facility 
fiscal year capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately million and are expected to be funded primarily by operating activities 
working capital increased to million at april   from million at april   and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities decreased to to at april   from to at april  the increase in working capital for fiscal year was attributed to increases in cash and cash equivalents 
we paid cash dividends of per share for each of the fiscal years   and we expect to pay dividends in the future in line with our actual and anticipated future operating results

sarbanes oxley section requirements on may   the us securities and exchange commission further extended the compliance dates for non accelerated filers to include in their annual reports a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting and an accompanying auditor s report 
as such  we must comply with this requirement for our year ending april  outlook our ability to predict future demand for our products is very limited  given  among other general economic factors affecting the company and our markets  our role as subcontractor or supplier to dealers of subcontractors 
in addition to these factors  demand for our products is also dependent upon the number of laboratory construction projects planned and or current progress in projects already under construction and our success in the competitive public bidding process for many of our contracts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the area of interest rates 
this exposure is associated with amounts outstanding under our bank note  certain lease obligations for production machinery  and advances under our revolving credit loan  all of which are priced on a floating rate basis 
the principal balance under the revolving credit loan was million at april  we believe that this exposure to market risk is not material
