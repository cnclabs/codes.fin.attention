to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income  determined in accordance with gaap 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following revenue recognition our revenues consist primarily of rentals received from tenants  which are comprised of minimum rent base rentals  bonus rentals and reimbursements from tenants for their pro rata share of expenses such as common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and utilities 
the minimum rent for all hospital facilities is fixed over the initial term or renewal term of the respective leases 
rental income recorded by our consolidated and unconsolidated mobs relating to leases in excess of one year in length  is recognized using the straight line method under which contractual rents are recognized evenly over the lease term regardless of when payments are due 
the amount of rental revenue resulting from straight line rent adjustments is dependent on many factors including the nature and amount of any rental concessions granted to new tenants  scheduled rent increases under existing leases  as well as the acquisitions and sales of properties that have existing in place leases with terms in excess of one year 
as a result  the straight line adjustments to rental revenue may vary from period to period 
bonus rents are recognized when earned based upon increases in each facility s net revenue in excess of stipulated amounts 
bonus rentals are determined and paid each quarter based upon a computation that compares the respective facility s current quarter s net revenue to the corresponding quarter in the base year 
tenant reimbursements for operating expenses are accrued as revenue in the same period the related expenses are incurred 
investments in limited liability companies llcs our consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of our controlled investments and those investments that meet the criteria of a variable interest entity where we are the primary beneficiary as a result of our level of investment in the entity 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for investments in real estate ventures and emerging issues task force issue  investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or 
table of contents shareholders have certain approval or veto rights  we account for our unconsolidated investments in llcs which we do not control using the equity method of accounting 
these investments  which represent to non controlling ownership interests  are recorded initially at our cost and subsequently adjusted for our net equity in the net income  cash contributions to  and distributions from  the investments 
pursuant to certain agreements  allocations of profits and losses of some of the llc investments may be allocated disproportionately as compared to ownership interests after specified preferred return rate thresholds have been satisfied 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation  as revised fin r  addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
effective march   we adopted fin r 
as a result of our related party relationship with uhs  and certain master lease  lease assurance or lease guarantee arrangements between uhs and various properties owned by three llcs in which we own non controlling ownership interests ranging from to  these llcs are considered to be variable interest entities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we are the primary beneficiary of these llc investments as a result of our level of investment in the entities 
consequently  we began consolidating the results of operations of these three llc investments 
included on our december  and consolidated balance sheet are the i assets  ii liabilities  iii third party borrowings  which are non recourse to us  and  iv minority interests  of these three llc investments 
also as a consequence of fin r  beginning on april   we began consolidating the results of operations of these llc investments on our consolidated statements of income 
there was no impact on our net income as a result of the consolidation of these llcs 
the remaining llcs are not variable interest entities and therefore are not subject to the consolidation requirements of fin r 
we anticipate that during  upon expiration of the master lease  lease assurance or lease guarantee arrangements with uhs  that one  and possibly two  of these variable interest entities will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting and will therefore be included in our results of operations on an unconsolidated basis 
federal income taxes no provision has been made for federal income tax purposes since we qualify as a reit under sections to of the internal revenue code of  and intend to continue to remain so qualified 
as such  we are exempt from federal income taxes and we are required to distribute at least of our real estate investment taxable income to our shareholders 
we are subject to a federal excise tax computed on a calendar year basis 
the excise tax equals of the amount by which of our ordinary income plus of any capital gain income for the calendar year exceeds cash distributions during the calendar year  as defined 
no provision for excise tax has been reflected in the financial statements as no tax was due 
earnings and profits  which determine the taxability of dividends to shareholders  will differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to the differences for federal tax purposes in the cost basis of assets and in the estimated useful lives used to compute depreciation and the recording of provision for investment losses 
relationship with uhs and related party transactions uhs is our principal tenant and through uhs of delaware  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of uhs  serves as our advisor the advisor under an advisory agreement dated december  between the advisor and us the advisory agreement 
our officers are all employees of uhs and as of december   we had no salaried employees 

table of contents under the advisory agreement  the advisor is obligated to present an investment program to us  to use its best efforts to obtain investments suitable for such program although it is not obligated to present any particular investment opportunity to us  to provide administrative services to us and to conduct our day to day affairs 
in performing its services under the advisory agreement  the advisor may utilize independent professional services  including accounting  legal  tax and other services  for which the advisor is reimbursed directly by us 
the advisory agreement expires on december of each year  however  it is renewable by us  subject to a determination by the independent trustees that the advisor s performance has been satisfactory 
the advisory agreement may be terminated for any reason upon sixty days written notice by us or the advisor 
the advisory agreement has been renewed for all transactions with uhs must be approved by the independent trustees 
the advisor is entitled to certain advisory and incentive fees for it services 
no incentive fees were paid during  and the advisory fee is payable quarterly  subject to adjustment at year end  based upon our audited financial statements

recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions  eliminating the alternative previously allowed by sfas no 
to use the intrinsic value method of accounting 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of the instruments using methods similar to those required by sfas no 
and currently used by us to calculate pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures 
the cost will be recognized ratably over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the sec deferred the effective date for sfas r for public companies from the interim to the first annual period beginning after december  accordingly  we adopted sfas no 
r as of january  as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  we will recognize as compensation cost in our financial statements the unvested portion of existing options granted prior to the effective date and the cost of stock options granted to employees after the effective date based on the fair value of the stock options at grant date 
we plan on using the black scholes model as our option pricing model for applying sfas r 
the transition alternatives include a modified prospective and retroactive methods 
under the retroactive method  all prior periods presented would be restated 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards that subsequently vest or are modified after the beginning of the first period restated 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method for transition purposes 
based on stock options outstanding at december   the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
had we adopted sfas  the additional stock based compensation expense determined under the black scholes model would have been  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these pro forma amounts may not be representative of future expense amounts since the estimated fair value of the stock option is amortized to expense over the vesting period  and additional options may be granted in future years 

table of contents conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no

fin clarifies that conditional obligations meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and therefore should be recognized if their fair value is reasonable to estimate 
we adopted fin as of december  we conducted a review of each of our properties to determine if we had obligations to perform asset retirement activity which may not be within our control  such as the remediation or removal of asbestos containing materials

table of contents effects of inflation although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years  the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
operators of our hospital facilities are experiencing the effects of the tight labor market  including a shortage of nurses which has caused and may continue to cause an increase  in excess of the inflation rate  in salaries  wages and benefits expense 
in addition  due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets  the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly 
as a result  certain operators of our hospital facilities  including all of the facilities leased to subsidiaries of uhs  assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk 
we cannot predict the ability of the operators of our facilities to continue to cover future cost increases 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these trends will not have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations of the operators of our facilities which may affect their ability to make lease payments to us 
most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
our hospital leases require all building operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes and other costs  to be paid by the lessee 
in addition  certain of the hospital leases contain bonus rental provisions  which require the lessee to pay additional rent to us based on increases in the revenues of the facility over a base year amount 
in addition  most of our mob leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  insurance and real estate taxes 
these provisions may reduce our exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation 
to the extent that some leases do not contain such provisions  our future operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in domestic interest rates  a portion of our debt is fixed rate accomplished by entering into interest rate swap agreements
