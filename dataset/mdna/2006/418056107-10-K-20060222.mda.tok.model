table of contents certain marvel properties  including spiderman  for retail sale beginning on january  the agreement requires us to make guaranteed minimum payments in the amount of  of this  in guaranteed payment   was paid in february   is expected to be paid in upon the release of spiderman and the remainder is to be paid upon the release of spiderman  whose release date is yet to be determined 
marketing and sales our products are sold nationally and internationally to a broad spectrum of customers  including wholesalers  distributors  chain stores  discount stores  mail order houses  catalog stores  department stores and other traditional retailers  large and small  as well as internet based e tailers 
our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products 
remaining sales are generated by independent distributors who sell our products  for the most part  in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence 
we maintain showrooms in new york and selected other major cities worldwide as well as at many of our subsidiary locations 
although we had more than  customers in the united states and canada during  including specialty retailers carrying trading card games and toy related products  there has been significant consolidation at the retail level over the last several years in our industry  which we expect to continue 
as a result  the majority of our sales are to large chain stores  distributors and wholesalers 
while the consolidation of customers provides us with certain benefits  such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution  this consolidation also creates additional risks to our business associated with a major customer having financial difficulties or reducing its business with us 
in addition  customer concentration may decrease the prices we are able to obtain for some of our products and reduce the number of products we would otherwise be able to bring to market 
during  sales to our three largest customers  wal mart stores  inc  toys r us  inc and target corporation  represented  and  respectively  of consolidated net revenues  and sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues 
we advertise many of our toy and game products extensively on television 
generally our advertising highlights selected items in our various product groups in a manner designed to promote the sale of not only the selected item  but also other items we offer in those product groups as well 
we introduce many of our new products to major customers during the year prior to the year of introduction of such products for retail sale 
in addition  we showcase many of our new products in new york city at the time of the american international toy fair in february 
in we spent  on advertising  promotion and marketing programs compared to  in and  in manufacturing and importing during substantially all of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the far east as well as in our two owned facilities located in east longmeadow  massachusetts and waterford  ireland 
most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic  paper and cardboard  although certain products also make use of electronic components 
all of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price 
we generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year 
for this reason  we are generally insulated  in the short term  from increases in the prices of raw materials 
however  severe increases in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year 
our manufacturing processes and those of our vendors include injection molding  blow molding  spray painting  printing  box making and assembly 
we purchase most of the components and accessories used in our toys and certain of the components used in our games  as well as some finished items  from manufacturers in the united states and in other countries 
however  the countries of the far east  and particularly the people s republic of china  constitute the largest manufacturing center of toys in the world and the substantial majority of our toy products are manufactured in china 
the implementation of the general agreement on tariffs and trade reduced or eliminated customs duties on many of the products imported by us 

table of contents we believe that the manufacturing capacity of our third party manufacturers  together with our own facilities  as well as the supply of components  accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers  are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in for our products 
our reliance on designated external sources of manufacturing could be shifted  over a period of time  to alternative sources of supply for our products  should such changes be necessary or desirable 
however  if we were to be prevented from obtaining products from a substantial number of our current far east suppliers due to political  labor or other factors beyond our control  our operations and our ability to obtain products would be disrupted while alternative sources of product were secured 
the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from  or the loss of normal trade relations status by  the people s republic of china could significantly disrupt our operations and increase the cost of our products imported into the united states or europe 
we purchase dies and molds  principally from independent united states and international sources 
competition we are a worldwide leader in the design  manufacture and marketing of games and toys  but our business is highly competitive 
we compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories  as well as many smaller united states and international toy and game designers  manufacturers and marketers 
competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products 
to a lesser extent  competition is also based on product pricing 
in addition to contending with competition from other toy and game companies  in our business we must deal with the phenomena that many children have been moving away from traditional toys and games at a younger age 
we refer to this as children getting older younger 
as a result  our products not only compete with the offerings of other toy and game manufacturers  but we must compete  particularly in meeting the demands of older children  with the entertainment offerings of many other companies  such as makers of video games and consumer electronic products 
the volatility in consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment and low barriers to entry continually create new opportunities for existing competitors and start ups to develop products which compete with our toy and game offerings 
employees at december   we employed approximately  persons worldwide  approximately  of whom were located in the united states 
trademarks  copyrights and patents we seek to protect our products  for the most part  and in as many countries as practical  through registered trademarks  copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available  cost effective  and meaningful 
the loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business  although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect 
government regulation our toy and game products sold in the united states are subject to the provisions of the consumer product safety act the cpsa  the federal hazardous substances act the fhsa  the flammable fabrics act the ffa  and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
in addition  certain of our products  such as the mixes for our easy bake ovens  are also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 
the cpsa empowers the consumer product safety commission the cpsc to take action against hazards presented by consumer products  including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards 
the cpsc has the authority to seek to declare a product a banned hazardous substance under the cpsa and to ban it from commerce 
the cpsc can file an action to seize and condemn 
table of contents an imminently hazardous consumer product under the cpsa and may also order equitable remedies such as recall  replacement  repair or refund for the product 
the fhsa provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned 
consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the united states and in canada  australia and europe 
we maintain laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the cpsa  the fhsa  the ffa  international standards  and our own standards 
notwithstanding the foregoing  there can be no assurance that our products are or will be hazard free 
any material product recall could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  depending on the product and scope of the recall  and could negatively affect sales of our other products  as well 
the children s television act of and the rules promulgated thereunder by the united states federal communications commission  as well as the laws of certain foreign countries  place limitations on television commercials during children s programming 
we maintain programs to comply with various united states federal  state  local and international requirements relating to the environment  plant safety and other matters

table of contents volatility of consumer preferences  combined with the high level of competition and low barriers to entry in the family entertainment industry make it difficult to maintain the long term success of existing product lines or consistently introduce successful new products 
in addition  an inability to develop and introduce planned new products and product lines in a timely manner may damage our business 
the family entertainment business is a fashion industry 
our success is critically dependent upon the consumer appeal of our products  principally games and toys 
our failure to successfully anticipate  identify and react to children s interests and the preferences in family entertainment could significantly lower sales of our products and harm our profitability 
a decline in the popularity of our existing products and product lines  or the failure of our new products and product lines to achieve and sustain market acceptance  could significantly lower our sales and operating margins  which would harm our profitability  business and financial condition 
in our industry  it is important to identify and offer what are considered to be the hot toys and games on children s wish lists 
our continued success will depend on our ability to develop  market and sell popular toys  games and children s electronic products which are sought after by both children and their parents 
we seek to achieve and maintain market popularity for our products through the redesign and extension of our existing family entertainment properties in ways that capture consumer interest and imagination and remain relevant in today s world  and by developing  introducing and gaining customer interest for new family entertainment products 
this process involves anticipating and extending successful play patterns and identifying entertainment concepts and properties that appeal to children s imaginations 
however  consumer preferences with respect to family entertainment are continuously changing and are difficult to anticipate 
individual family entertainment products and properties generally  and high technology products in particular  often have short consumer life cycles 
not only must we address rapidly changing consumer tastes and interests but we face competitors who are also constantly monitoring consumer tastes  seeking ideas which will appeal to consumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer purchasing 
in addition to existing competitors  the barriers to entry for new participants in the family entertainment industry are low 
new participants with a popular product idea or property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products 
the challenge of developing and offering products that are sought after by children is compounded by the trend of children getting older younger 
by this we mean that children are losing interest in traditional toys at younger ages and  as a result  at younger and younger ages  our products compete with the offerings of video game suppliers  consumer electronics companies and other businesses outside of the traditional toy and game industry 
in addition to designing and developing products based on our own brands  we seek to fulfill consumer preferences and interests by producing products based on popular entertainment properties developed by other parties and licensed to us 
the success of entertainment properties released theatrically for which we have a license  such as star wars related products  can significantly affect our revenues 
if we produce a line of products based on a movie or television series  the success of the movie or series has a critical impact on the level of consumer interest in the associated products we are offering 
in addition  competition in our industry for access to entertainment properties can lessen our ability to secure  maintain  and renew popular licenses to entertainment products on beneficial terms  if at all  and to attract and retain the talented employees necessary to design  develop and market successful products based on these properties 
the loss of ownership rights granted pursuant to any of our licensing agreements could harm our business and competitive position 
there is no guarantee that any of our current products or product lines will continue to be popular  any property for which we have a significant license will achieve or sustain popularity  any new products or product lines we introduce will be considered interesting to consumers and achieve an adequate market acceptance  
table of contents any new product s life cycle will be sufficient to permit us to profitably recover development  manufacturing  marketing  royalties including royalty advances and guarantees and other costs of producing and selling the product  or we will be able to manufacture  source and ship new or continuing products in a timely basis to meet constantly changing consumer demands  a risk that is heightened by our customers compressed shipping schedules and the seasonality of our business 
in developing new products and product lines  we have anticipated dates for the associated product introductions 
when we state that we will introduce  or anticipate introducing  a particular product or product line at a certain time in the future those expectations are based on completing the associated development and implementation work in accordance with our currently anticipated development schedule 
unforeseen delays or difficulties in the development process  or significant increases in the planned cost of development  may cause the introduction date for products to be later than anticipated or  in some situations  may cause a product introduction to be discontinued 
similarly  the success of our products is often dependent on the timelines and effectiveness of related advertising and media efforts 
television programming  movie and dvd releases  comic book releases  and other media efforts are often critical in generating interest in our products 
not only our efforts  but the efforts of third parties  heavily impact the launch dates and success of these media efforts 
when we say that products or brands will be supported by certain media releases  those statements are based on our current plans and expectations 
unforeseen factors may delay these media releases or even lead to their cancellation 
any delay or cancellation of planned product development work  introductions  or media support may decrease the number of products we sell and harm our business 
our business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend  in large part  on our sales during the relatively brief holiday season 
further  this seasonality is increasing  as large retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques 
sales of our family entertainment products at retail are extremely seasonal  with a majority of retail sales occurring during the period from september through december in anticipation of the holiday season  including christmas 
this seasonality is increasing  as large retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick response inventory management techniques 
these customers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers  such as us  closer to the time of purchase by consumers 
for toys  games and other family entertainment products which we produce a majority of retail sales occur in the fourth quarter  close to the holiday season 
as a consequence  the majority of our sales to our customers occur in the period from september through december  as our customers do not want to maintain large on hand inventories throughout the year to meet consumer demand 
while these techniques reduce a retailer s investment in inventory  they increase pressure on suppliers like us to fill orders promptly and thereby shift a significant portion of inventory risk and carrying costs to the supplier 
the limited inventory carried by retailers may also reduce or delay retail sales  resulting in lower revenues for us 
if we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated  we may not have sufficient time to produce and ship enough additional product to fully capture consumer interest in the product 
additionally  the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time periods increases the risk that we will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules  which also may reduce our sales and harm our financial performance 
this seasonal pattern requires significant use of working capital  mainly to manufacture or acquire inventory during the portion of the year prior to the holiday season  and requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to avoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers 
our failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand  resulting in our underproducing popular items and or overproducing less popular items  would reduce our total sales and harm our results of operations 
in addition  as a result of the seasonal nature of our business  we would be significantly and adversely affected  in a manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year  by unforeseen events  such as a terrorist attack or economic shock  that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season  or by events  such 
table of contents as strikes or port delays  that interfere with the shipment of goods  particularly from the far east  during the months leading up to the holiday purchasing season 
the continuing consolidation of our retail customer base means that economic difficulties or changes in the purchasing policies of our major customers could have a significant impact on us 
we depend upon a relatively small retail customer base to sell the majority of our products 
for the fiscal year ended december   wal mart stores  inc  toys r us  inc  and target corporation accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net revenues and our five largest customers  including wal mart  toys r us and target  in the aggregate accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues 
while the consolidation of our customer base may provide certain benefits to us  such as potentially more efficient product distribution and other decreased costs of sales and distribution  this consolidation also means that if one or more of our major customers were to experience difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to us  cease doing business with us  significantly reduce the amount of their purchases from us or return substantial amounts of our products  it could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
increased concentration among our customers could also negatively impact our ability to negotiate higher sales prices for our products and could result in lower gross margins than would otherwise be obtained if there were less consolidation among our customers 
in addition  the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one or more of our significant retail customers could negatively impact our revenues and bad debt expense 
we may not realize the full benefit of our licenses if the licensed material has less market appeal than expected or if sales revenue from the licensed products is not sufficient to earn out the minimum guaranteed royalties 
an important part of our business involves obtaining licenses to produce products based on various theatrical releases  such as star wars movies 
the license agreements we enter to obtain these rights usually require us to pay minimum royalty guarantees that may be substantial  and in some cases may be greater than what we are ultimately able to recoup from actual sales  which could result in write offs of such amounts that would harm our results of operations 
at december   we had  of prepaid royalties   of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and  of which are included in other assets 
under the terms of existing contracts as of december   we are required to pay future minimum guaranteed royalties and other licensing fees totaling approximately  acquiring or renewing licenses may require the payment of minimum guaranteed royalties that we consider to be too high to be profitable  which may result in losing licenses we currently hold when they become available for renewal  or missing business opportunities for new licenses 
as a licensee  we have no guaranty that a particular brand will translate into successful toy or game products 
in addition to contracts existing as of the end of our fiscal year  in january  we entered into a license arrangement with marvel entertainment  inc  and its subsidiary marvel characters  inc 
this license arrangement  which grants us the right to produce certain products based on marvel s characters for five years for retail sales beginning in  requires us to make guaranteed minimum payments in the amount of up to  there is no guarantee that we will sell enough licensed merchandise under the agreement to earn out the  in guaranteed payments and make a profit 
we anticipate that the shorter theatrical duration for movie releases will make it increasingly difficult for us to sell licensed products based on entertainment properties and may lead our customers to reduce their demand for these products in order to minimize inventory risk 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that a successful brand will continue to be successful or maintain a high level of sales in the future 
in the event that we are not able to acquire or maintain advantageous licenses  our revenues and profits may be harmed 

table of contents our substantial sales and manufacturing operations outside the united states subject us to risks associated with international operations 
we operate facilities and sell products in numerous countries outside the united states 
for the year ended december   our net revenues from international customers comprised approximately of our total consolidated net revenues 
we expect our sales to international customers to continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
additionally  we utilize third party manufacturers located principally in the far east and we have a manufacturing facility in ireland 
these sales and manufacturing operations are subject to the risks associated with international operations  including currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations  limitations  including taxes  on the repatriation of earnings  political instability  civil unrest and economic instability  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights  complications in complying with laws in varying jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies  natural disasters and the greater difficulty and expense in recovering therefrom  transportation delays and interruptions  and the imposition of tariffs 
our reliance on external sources of manufacturing can be shifted  over a period of time  to alternative sources of supply  should such changes be necessary 
however  if we were prevented from obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political  labor or other factors beyond our control  our operations would be disrupted while alternative sources of products were secured 
in particular  as the majority of our toy products  in addition to certain other products  are manufactured in the people s republic of china  health conditions and other factors affecting social and economic activity in china and affecting the movement of people and products into and from china to our major markets  including north america and europe  could have a significant negative impact on our operations 
factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential revaluation of the chinese yuan  which may result in an increase in the cost of producing products in china  or increases in labor costs and difficulties in moving products manufactured in the far east through the ports on the western coast of north america 
also  the imposition of trade sanctions by the united states or the european union against a class of products imported by us from  or the loss of normal trade relations status with  the people s republic of china  could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the united states or europe and harm our business 
because of the importance of our international sales and international sourcing of manufacturing to our business  our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly harmed if any of the risks described above were to occur 
part of our strategy for remaining relevant to older children is to offer innovative children s toy and game electronic products 
the margins on many of these products are lower than more traditional toys and games and such products may have a shorter lifespan than more traditional toys and games 
as a result  increasing sales of children s toy and game electronic products may lower our overall operating margins and produce more volatility in our business 
as children have grown older younger and have become interested in more and more sophisticated and adult products  such as videogames and consumer electronics  at younger and younger ages  we have needed to work even harder to keep our products relevant for these consumers 
one initiative we have been pursuing to capture the interest of older children is to offer innovative children s electronic toys and games 
examples of such products in the last few years include videonow  chatnow  mission paintball and i dog 
these products  if successful  can be an effective way for us to connect with tween consumers and increase 
table of contents sales 
however  children s electronics  in addition to the risks associated with our other family entertainment products  also face certain additional risks 
our costs for producing electronic products tend to be higher than for many of our other more traditional products  such as board games and action figures 
the ability to reflect higher costs in higher prices is constrained by heavy competition in consumer electronics 
as a consequence  our margins on the sales of electronic products tend to be lower than for more traditional products 
in addition  the pace of change in product offerings and consumer tastes in the electronics area is potentially even greater than for our other products 
this pace of change means that the window in which a product can achieve and maintain consumer interest may be even shorter 
market conditions  including commodity and fuel prices  public health conditions and other third party conduct could negatively impact our margins and our other business initiatives 
economic and public health conditions  including factors that impact the strength of the retail market and retail demand  or our ability to manufacture and deliver products  can have a significant impact on our business 
the success of our family entertainment products is dependant on consumer purchasing of those products 
consumers may not purchase our products because the products do not capture consumer interest and imagination 
but consumer spending on our products can also be harmed by factors that negatively impact consumer s budgets generally  and which are not due to our product offerings 
significant increases in the costs of other products which are required by consumers  such as gasoline and home heating fuels  may reduce household spending on entertainment products we offer 
in addition  rising fuel and raw material prices  for components such as resin  or increased transportation costs  may increase our costs for producing and transporting our products  which in turn may reduce our margins and harm our business 
in addition  general economic conditions and employment levels can impact demand for our products 
economic conditions were significantly harmed by the september  terrorist attacks and could be similarly affected by any future attacks 
economic conditions may also be negatively impacted by wars and other conflicts  increases in critical commodity prices  or the prospect of such events 
such a weakened economic and business climate  as well as consumer uncertainty created by such a climate  could harm our sales and profitability 
other conditions  such as the unavailability of electrical components  may impede our ability to manufacture  source and ship new and continuing products on a timely basis 
additional factors outside of our control could delay or increase the cost of implementing our business initiatives and product plans or alter our actions and reduce actual results 
for example  work stoppages  slowdowns or strikes  or the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts  could impact our ability to manufacture or deliver product  resulting in increased costs and or lost sales for our products 
our business is dependent on intellectual property rights and we may not be able to protect such rights successfully 
in addition  we have a material amount of acquired product rights which  if impaired  would result in a reduction of our income 
our intellectual property  including our license agreements and other agreements that establish our ownership rights and maintain the confidentiality of our intellectual property  are of great value 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright  trademark  patent and other proprietary rights laws to protect our rights to valuable intellectual property related to our brands 
from time to time  third parties have challenged  and may in the future try to challenge  our ownership of our intellectual property 
in addition  our business is subject to the risk of third parties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights 
we may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business and competitive position 
much of our intellectual property has been internally developed and has no carrying value on our balance sheet 
as of december   we had approximately  of acquired product and licensing rights included in other assets on our balance sheet 
declines in the profitability of the acquired brands or licensed products may impact our ability to recover the carrying value of the related assets and 
table of contents could result in an impairment charge 
reduction in our net income caused by impairment charges could harm our financial results 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of future acquisitions or those benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 
although we have not made any major acquisitions in the last few years  acquisitions have been a significant part of our historical growth and have enabled us to further broaden and diversify our product offerings 
in making acquisitions  we target companies that we believe offer attractive family entertainment products 
however  we cannot be certain that the products of companies we may acquire in the future will achieve or maintain popularity with consumers 
in some cases  we expect that the integration of the product lines of the companies that we acquire into our operations will create production  marketing and other operating synergies which will produce greater revenue growth and profitability and  where applicable  cost savings  operating efficiencies and other advantages 
however  we cannot be certain that these synergies  efficiencies and cost savings will be realized 
even if achieved  these benefits may be delayed or reduced in their realization 
in other cases  we acquire companies that we believe have strong and creative management  in which case we plan to operate them autonomously rather than fully integrating them into our operations 
we cannot be certain that the key talented individuals at these companies will continue to work for us after the acquisition or that they will continue to develop popular and profitable products or services 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation  arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 
as is the case with many large multinational corporations  we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations  litigation and arbitration disputes 
because the outcome of litigation  arbitration and regulatory investigations is inherently difficult to predict  it is possible that the outcome of any of these matters could entail significant expense for us and harm our business 
we rely on external financing  including our credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization facility  to fund our operations 
if we were unable to obtain or service such financing  or if the restrictions imposed by such financing were too burdensome  our business would be harmed 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  in order to meet our working capital needs  particularly those in the third and fourth quarters  we rely on our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities for working capital 
we currently have an amended and restated revolving credit agreement  which provides for a  revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants setting forth minimum cash flow and coverage requirements  and a number of other limitations  including restrictions on capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions  share repurchases  incurrence of indebtedness and dividend payments 
these restrictive covenants may limit our future actions  and financial  operating and strategic flexibility 
in addition  our financial covenants were set at the time we entered into our credit facility 
our performance and financial condition may not meet our original expectations  causing us to fail to meet such financial covenants 
if we were unable to meet our financial covenants  or if we failed to comply with other covenants in our credit facility  we could face significant negative consequences  including loss of the ability to raise capital under these facilities to fund our operations 
as an additional source of working capital and liquidity  we currently have a  accounts receivable securitization program 
under this program  we sell on an ongoing basis  substantially all of our us dollar denominated trade accounts receivable to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity 
under this facility  the special purpose entity is able to sell  on a revolving basis  undivided ownership interests in the eligible receivables to bank conduits 
during the term of the facility  we must maintain certain performance ratios 
if we fail to maintain these ratios  we could be prevented from accessing this cost effective source of working capital and short term financing 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with our cash on hand and access to existing credit facilities and our accounts receivable securitization facility  are adequate for current and planned needs 
table of contents in however  our actual experience may differ from these expectations 
factors that may lead to a difference include  but are not limited to  the matters discussed herein  as well as future events that might have the effect of reducing our available cash balance  such as unexpected material operating losses or increased capital or other expenditures  as well as increases in inventory or accounts receivable that are ineligible for sale under our securitization facility  or future events that may reduce or eliminate the availability of external financial resources 
we also may choose to finance our capital needs  from time to time  through the issuance of debt securities 
our ability to issue such securities on satisfactory terms  if at all  will depend on the state of our business and financial condition  any ratings issued by major credit rating agencies  market interest rates  and the overall condition of the financial and credit markets at the time of the offering 
the condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
variations in these factors could make it difficult for us to sell debt securities or require us to offer higher interest rates in order to sell new debt securities 
the failure to receive financing on desirable terms  or at all  could damage our ability to support our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities 
as of december   we had approximately million of total principal amount of indebtedness outstanding 
if we are unable to generate sufficient available cash flow to service our outstanding debt we would need to refinance such debt or face default 
there is no guarantee that we would be able to refinance debt on favorable terms  or at all 
this total indebtedness includes  in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible debentures that we issued in on december  and december   and upon the occurrence of certain fundamental corporate changes  holders of the senior convertible debentures may require us to purchase their debentures 
at that time  the purchase price may be paid in cash  shares of common stock or a combination of the two  at our discretion  provided that we will pay accrued and unpaid interest in cash 
we may not have sufficient cash at that time to make the required repurchases and may be required to settle in shares of common stock 
we previously issued warrants that provide the holder with an option through january to sell all of these warrants to us for a price to be paid  at our election  of either  in cash or  in our common stock  such stock being valued at the time of the exercise of the option 
should we be required to settle these warrants under this option  we believe that we will have adequate funds to settle in cash if necessary 
however  we may not have sufficient funds at that time to make the required payment and may be required to settle the warrants in stock 
as a manufacturer of consumer products and a large multinational corporation  we are subject to various government regulations  violation of which could subject us to sanctions 
in addition  we could be the subject of future product liability suits  which could harm our business 
as a manufacturer of consumer products  we are subject to significant government regulations under the consumer products safety act  the federal hazardous substances act  and the flammable fabrics act 
in addition  certain of our products are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration

thousands of dollars and shares except per share data executive summary the company earns revenue and generates cash through the sale of a variety of toy and game products 
the company sells these products both within the united states and in a number of international markets 
while many of the company s products are based on brands the company owns or controls  the company also offers products which are licensed from outside inventors 
the company also licenses rights to produce products based on movie  television  music and other family entertainment properties  such as star wars 
for the past several years  the company has focused on growing core owned and controlled brands  developing new and innovative products which respond to market insights  and optimizing efficiencies within the company to reduce costs  increase operating profits and strengthen its balance sheet 
while the company has sought to achieve a more sustainable revenue base by developing and maintaining its core brands and avoiding reliance on licensed entertainment properties  the company continues to opportunistically enter into or leverage existing strategic licenses which complement its brands and leverage its key strengths 
the company s core brands represent company owned or company controlled brands  such as gi joe  transformers  my little pony  monopoly  magic the gathering  playskool and tonka  which the company views as presenting potential to be successful over the long term 
the company has a large portfolio of owned and controlled brands  which can be introduced in new formats and platforms over time 
these brands may also be further extended by pairing a licensed concept with a core brand 
by focusing on core brands  the company is working to build a more consistent revenue stream and basis for future growth 
however  the volatility of consumer preferences and the high level of competition in the toy and game industry make it challenging to maintain the long term success of existing product lines and to consistently introduce successful new products 
in addition to its focus on core brands  the company s strategy also involves trying to meet ever changing consumer preferences by identifying and offering innovative products based on market opportunities and insights 
in  the company s position as a leader in developing innovative electronic products for children was reinforced with the introduction of products such as i dog  videonow xp  zoombox and the reintroduction of an enhanced  interactive furby 
the company believes its strategy of focusing on the development of its core brands and continuing to identify innovative new products will help to prevent the company from being dependent on the success of any one product line 
with the theatrical release of lucasfilm s star wars episode iii revenge of the sith in may  and the subsequent holiday season dvd release  sales of product related to the company s strategic star wars license rose substantially in aggregate net revenues from products associated with this license were approximately  in and accounted for of consolidated net revenues 
pairing this key licensed property with the company s ability to design and produce action figures  role playing toys  and games  as well as the ability to launch an integrated marketing campaign to promote the product globally  was the key to this line s success 
while the company s strategy has continued to focus on growing its core brands and developing innovative  new products  the company will continue to evaluate and enter into arrangements to license properties when the company believes it is economically attractive 
in early  the company announced it entered into a license with marvel entertainment  inc and marvel characters  inc to produce toys and games based on marvel s portfolio of characters 
while gross profits of theatrical entertainment based products are generally higher than many of the company s other products  sales from 
table of contents these products also incur royalty expenses payable to the licensor 
such royalties reduce the impact of these higher gross margins 
in certain instances  such as with lucasfilm s star wars  the company may also incur amortization expense on property right based assets acquired from the licensor of such properties  further impacting profit made on these items 
the company s strategy in the last several years has also involved reducing fixed costs and increasing operating margins 
the company ended with a strong balance sheet 
the company has achieved its targeted debt to capitalization ratio and will continue making scheduled debt repayments 
in  utilizing cash from operations  the company reacquired the digital gaming rights on several of its core brands which had previously been licensed to a third party  and purchased the assets of wrebbit inc  a maker of innovative puzzles  which complement the company s current product portfolio 
the company will continue to evaluate acquisitions which may complement its current product offerings or allow it entry into an area which is adjacent to and complementary to the toy and game business 
as part of its continuous effort to focus on consumer demands  better anticipate the needs of its retail customers  provide a more integrated toy and game marketing plan  place a greater company wide focus on its core brands and thereby improve its overall business  in january the company announced that it has simplified and integrated its operating segment structure 
the company s north american toy and games business will be managed under common leadership beginning in  providing a combined focus on developing  marketing  and selling products in the us  canada and mexico 
the international segment will consist of the company s european  asia pacific and latin american marketing operations 
the company s world wide manufacturing and product sourcing operations will be managed through its global operations segment 
the hasbro properties group will continue to be responsible for the world wide outlicensing of the company s intellectual properties and will work closely with the north american and international segments on the development and licensing of the company s brands 
the remainder of this discussion and analysis is presented according to the segment structure under which the company operated

as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include sales allowances  inventory valuation  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions 
sales allowances for customer promotions  discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized

goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  the company will perform an interim test at that time 
the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units 
goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach  which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach 
the company s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of and no impairment was indicated 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
at december   the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of  recorded on the balance sheet 
intangible assets  other than those with indefinite lives  are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value 
table of contents to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
intangible assets covered under this policy were  at december  during  there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 
the recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product 
if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or  if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments  a charge to royalty expense to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required 
the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties

the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan  the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes  and the current economic environment 
based on this information  the company s estimate of expected return on domestic plan assets was in  and a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense  while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of 
in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense for us plans by approximately expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical compensation increases with expected compensation increases in the company s long term business forecasts 
based on this analysis  the company s estimate of expected long term compensation increases for its us plans was in  and increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense 
discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
based on this long term corporate bond yield at september   the company s measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities  the company selected a discount rate for its domestic plans of 
a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of 
in the company s discount rate would increase pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately and  respectively

 employers accounting for pensions  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if outside a certain corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date 
in and  the company recorded a minimum pension liability for its us plans of  and  respectively

the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could 
table of contents result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transaction 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company believes  however  that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition

the interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt 
changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of long term debt 
at december   these contracts had a fair value of  with included in other assets  and the remaining included in prepaid expenses and other current assets  with corresponding fair value adjustments to increase long term debt and current portions of long term debt  respectively

the company expects that this concentration will continue  particularly as more of its business shifts to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year 
the concentration of sales in the second half of the year and  specifically  the fourth quarter increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items  b overproduction of less popular items  and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules 
the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line  product availability  marketing strategies  inventory levels  policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions 
the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season  which includes christmas 
quick response inventory management practices now being used result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment
