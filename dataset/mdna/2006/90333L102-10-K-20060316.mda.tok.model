part i item business general we are a major producer of ready mixed concrete and concrete related products in select markets in the united states 
we are a leading ready mixed concrete producer in substantially all the markets in which we have ready mixed concrete operations 
ready mixed concrete is an important building material that is used in the vast majority of commercial  residential and public works construction projects 
we operate principally in california  new jersey  michigan and texas  with those states representing   and  respectively  of our net sales for the year ended december  according to publicly available industry information  those states represented an aggregate of of the us consumption of ready mixed concrete in california   new jersey   michigan  and texas  
we believe the geographic scope of our operations enables us to achieve cost savings through consolidated purchasing  to reduce our administrative costs and to moderate the impact of regional economic cycles and weather conditions 
our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  of which we derived approximately from the sale of ready mixed concrete and from the sale of other concrete and concrete related products and aggregates 
for information on our consolidated revenues and income from operations for the years ended december   and and our consolidated total assets as of december  and  see our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
as of march   we had fixed and seven portable ready mixed concrete plants  eight precast concrete plants  three concrete block plants and two aggregates quarries 
during  these facilities produced approximately million cubic yards of ready mixed concrete  million eight inch equivalent block units and million tons of aggregates 
our operations consist principally of formulating  preparing and delivering ready mixed concrete to the job sites of our customers 
we also provide services intended to reduce our customers overall construction costs by lowering the installed  or in place  cost of concrete 
these services include the formulation of mixtures for specific design uses  on site and lab based product quality control and customized delivery programs to meet our customers needs 
our marketing efforts primarily target general contractors  developers and home builders whose focus extends beyond the price of ready mixed concrete to product quality  product consistency and reduction of in place concrete costs 
in addition  we manufacture and deliver various precast and concrete masonry products for the construction industry 
these businesses are complementary to our ready mixed concrete operations and provide us opportunities to cross sell various products in markets in which we sell both ready mixed concrete and other concrete products 
us concrete  inc is a delaware corporation which was incorporated in we began operations in on completion of our initial public offering 
in this report  we refer to us concrete  inc and its subsidiaries as we  us or us concrete unless we specifically state otherwise or the context indicates otherwise 
industry overview general ready mixed concrete is a highly versatile construction material that results from combining coarse and fine aggregates  such as gravel  crushed stone and sand  with water  various admixtures and cement 
ready mixed concrete can be manufactured in thousands of variations  which in each instance may reflect a specific design use 
manufacturers of ready mixed concrete generally maintain only a few days inventory of raw materials and must coordinate their daily materials purchases with the time sensitive delivery requirements of their customers 
the quality of ready mixed concrete is time sensitive  as it becomes difficult to place within minutes after mixing 
many ready mixed concrete specifications do not allow for its placement beyond that time 
consequently  the market for a permanently installed ready mixed concrete plant generally is limited to an area within a mile radius of its location 
concrete manufacturers produce ready mixed concrete in batches at their plants and use mixer and other trucks to distribute and place it at the job sites of their customers 
these manufacturers generally do not provide paving or other finishing services  which construction contractors or subcontractors typically perform 
concrete manufacturers generally obtain contracts through local sales and marketing efforts they direct at general contractors  developers and home builders 
as a result  local relationships are very important 
based on information from the national ready mixed concrete association  we estimate that  in addition to vertically integrated manufacturers of cements and aggregates  over  independent ready mixed concrete producers currently operate approximately  plants in the united states 
larger markets generally have numerous producers competing for business on the basis of price  timing of delivery and reputation for quality and service 
annual usage of ready mixed concrete in the united states remains near record levels 
according to information available from the national ready mixed concrete association and fw dodge  total sales from the production and delivery of ready mixed concrete in the united states over the past three years were as follows in millions as an important material for construction and repair  ready mixed concrete historically benefited from relatively stable demand and pricing but has experienced significant price increases over the past months  driven largely by strong construction activity and increases in cement prices 
according to recently published fw dodge data  the four major segments of the construction industry accounted for the following approximate percentages of the total volume of ready mixed concrete produced in the united states in residential construction commercial and industrial construction street and highway construction and paving other public works and infrastructure construction historically  barriers to the start up of a new ready mixed concrete manufacturing operation were low 
during the past several years  public concerns about dust  process water runoff  noise and heavy mixer and other truck traffic associated with the operation of ready mixed concrete plants and their general appearance have made obtaining the permits and licenses required for new plants more difficult 
delays in the regulatory process  coupled with the substantial capital investment that start up operations entail  have raised the barriers to entry for those operations 
for a discussion of the seasonality of the ready mixed concrete industry generally  see risk factors our operating results may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period and may be adversely affected by the seasonal and cyclical nature of the markets we serve and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in item of this report 
significant factors impacting the market for ready mixed concrete on the basis of available industry information  we believe that ready mixed concrete revenue as a percentage of total construction expenditures in the united states has increased over the last five years 
in addition to favorable trends in the overall economy of the united states  we believe three significant factors have been expanding the market for ready mixed concrete in particular the increased level of industry wide promotional and marketing activities  the development of new and innovative uses for ready mixed concrete  and the enactment of federal highway funding legislation 
industry wide promotional and marketing activities 
we believe industry participants have only since the s focused on and benefited from promotional activities to increase the industry s share of street and highway construction  commercial and industrial construction and residential construction expenditures 
many of these promotional efforts resulted from an industry wide initiative called rmc  a program established in under the leadership of our chief executive officer  eugene p 
martineau 
the national ready mixed concrete association  the industry s largest trade organization  has adopted this program 
the program s principal goals have been to promote ready mixed concrete as a building and paving material  improve the overall image of the ready mixed concrete industry and improve financial returns for producers of ready mixed concrete 
we believe rmc has been a catalyst for increased investment in the promotion of concrete 
development of concrete products 
concrete has many attributes that make it a highly versatile construction material 
in recent years  industry participants have developed various uses for concrete products  including concrete housing  precast modular paving stones  pre stressed concrete railroad ties to replace wood ties  flowable fill for backfill applications  continuous slab rail support systems for rapid transit and heavy traffic rail lines  and concrete bridges  tunnels and other structures for rapid transit systems 
other examples of successful innovations that have opened new markets for concrete include overlaying asphalt pavement with concrete  or white topping  highway median barriers  highway sound barriers  paved shoulders to replace less permanent and increasingly costly asphalt shoulders  pervious concrete parking lots providing a long lasting and aesthetically pleasing urban environment  and colored pavements to mark entrance and exit ramps and lanes of expressways 
federal highway funding legislation 
in august  president bush signed a six year  billion transportation reauthorization act known as the safe  accountable  flexible and efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users 
the new law funds  among other things  federal bridge and highway construction programs 
while we do not expect this new law to affect our revenues materially in  we believe that the new law may lead to market opportunities for our products and a strong base for the public works construction segment for the future 
our business strategy our objectives are to become the leading provider of ready mixed concrete and related concrete products in each of our markets  to further expand the geographic scope of our business and  on a select basis  to integrate our operations vertically through acquisitions of aggregates supply sources that support our ready mixed concrete operations 
we plan to achieve this objective by continuing to implement our business strategy  which includes the primary elements we discuss below 
pursuing disciplined growth through acquisitions the us ready mixed concrete industry  with over  small  independent producers  is a fragmented but increasingly consolidating industry 
we believe these industry characteristics present growth opportunities for a company with a focused acquisition program and access to capital 
our acquisition program targets opportunities for expanding in our existing markets and entering new geographic markets in the us we typically pursue acquisitions that we believe represent attractive opportunities to strengthen local management teams  implement cost saving initiatives  achieve market leading positions and establish best practices 
we adhere to a disciplined pricing methodology when acquiring businesses 
based on our methodology for valuing  acquiring and integrating target businesses  we expect our future acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings per share after a reasonable period of integration 
we cannot provide any assurance  however  as to the impact of any future acquisition we may complete on our future earnings per share 
expanding in existing markets 
we seek to further penetrate our markets by acquiring other well established companies in those markets 
we have completed follow on acquisitions in substantially all of our ready mixed concrete markets 
by expanding in existing markets through acquisitions  we strive to eliminate duplicate staff and facilities and reduce material and operating costs and other selling  general and administrative expenses  increase customer cross selling opportunities  and improve utilization and range of mixer trucks through access to additional plants 
entering new geographic markets 
we seek to enter new geographic markets that demonstrate prospects for growth 
in any new market we enter  we will target for acquisition one or more leading local or regional companies that can serve as platform businesses into which we can consolidate other operations 
we generally expect these platform acquisition candidates to have historically successful operating results  established customer relationships and superior operational management personnel whom we will be able to retain 
we believe there are numerous potential acquisition candidates in our existing markets and in new markets 
although we have no binding agreement to effect any acquisition  we have experienced increases in inquiries and similar communications with brokers and other representatives of potential acquisition candidates over the past year  and we are currently evaluating several potential acquisitions 
we are currently a party to several nonbinding letters of intent relating to potential acquisitions of ready mixed concrete and related businesses 
we expect the economic and other industry conditions supporting recent consolidation activity within the industry will continue into the foreseeable future 
improving marketing and sales initiatives our marketing strategy emphasizes the sale of value added products to customers more focused on reducing their in place building material costs than on the price per cubic yard of the ready mixed concrete they purchase 
key elements of our customer focused approach include corporate level marketing and sales expertise  technical service expertise to develop innovative new branded products  and training programs that emphasize successful marketing and sales techniques that focus on the sale of high margin concrete mix designs 
we have also formed strategic alliances with several national companies to provide alternative solutions for designers and contractors by using value added concrete products 
through these alliances  we offer color conditioned  fiber reinforced and high performance concretes and utilize software technology that can be used to design buildings constructed of reinforced concrete 
promoting operational excellence and achieving cost efficiencies we strive to be an operationally excellent organization by implementing and enhancing standard operating procedures  standardizing plants and equipment  investing in software and communications technology  implementing company wide quality control initiatives  providing technical expertise to optimize mix designs  and developing strategic alliances with key suppliers of goods and services for new product development 
we also strive to increase operating efficiencies 
we believe that  if we continue to increase in size on both a local and national level  we should continue to experience future productivity and cost improvements in such areas as materials  through procurement and optimized mix designs  purchases of mixer trucks and other equipment  supplies  spare parts and tools  vehicle and equipment maintenance  and insurance and other risk management programs 
products and services ready mixed concrete 
our ready mixed concrete products consist of proportioned mixes we prepare and deliver in an unhardened plastic state for placement and shaping into designed forms 
selecting the optimum mix for a job entails determining not only the ingredients that will produce the desired permeability  strength  appearance and other properties of the concrete after it has hardened and cured  but also the ingredients necessary to achieve a workable consistency considering the weather and other conditions at the job site 
we believe we can achieve product differentiation for the mixes we offer because of the variety of mixes we can produce  our volume production capacity and our scheduling  delivery and placement reliability 
we also believe we distinguish ourselves with our value added service approach that emphasizes reducing our customers overall construction costs by reducing the in place cost of concrete and the time required for construction 
from a contractor s perspective  the in place cost of concrete includes both the amount paid to the ready mixed concrete manufacturer and the internal costs associated with the labor and equipment the contractor provides 
a contractor s unit cost of concrete is often only a small component of the total in place cost that takes into account all the labor and equipment costs required to build the forms for the ready mixed concrete and place and finish the ready mixed concrete  including the cost of additional labor and time lost as a result of substandard products or delivery delays not covered by warranty or insurance 
by carefully designing proper mixes and using advances in mixing technology  we can assist our customers in reducing the amount of reinforcing steel  time and labor they will require in various applications 
we provide a variety of services in connection with our sale of ready mixed concrete that can help reduce our customers in place cost of concrete 
these services include production of formulations and alternative product recommendations that reduce labor and materials costs  quality control  through automated production and laboratory testing  that ensures consistent results and minimizes the need to correct completed work  and automated scheduling and tracking systems that ensure timely delivery and reduce the downtime incurred by the customer s placing and finishing crews 
we produce ready mixed concrete by combining the desired type of cement  sand  gravel and crushed stone with water and  typically  one or more admixtures 
these admixtures  such as chemicals  minerals and fibers  determine the usefulness of the product for particular applications 
we use a variety of chemical admixtures to achieve one or more of five basic purposes to relieve internal pressure and increase resistance to cracking in subfreezing weather  to retard the hardening process to make concrete more workable in hot weather  to strengthen concrete by reducing its water content  to accelerate the hardening process and reduce the time required for curing  and to facilitate the placement of concrete having low water content 
we frequently use various mineral admixtures as supplementary cementing materials to alter the permeability  strength and other properties of concrete 
these materials include fly ash  ground granulated blast furnace slag and silica fume 
we also use fibers  such as steel  glass and synthetic and carbon filaments  as additives in various formulations of concrete 
fibers help to control shrinkage cracking  thus reducing permeability and improving abrasion resistance 
in many applications  fibers replace welded steel wire and reinforcing bars 
relative to the other components of ready mixed concrete  these additives generate comparatively high margins 
precast concrete 
we produce precast concrete products at eight plants in three states  including six in california 
our precast concrete products consist of concrete we produce and then pour into molds at our plant sites 
these operations produce a wide variety of specialized finished products  including specialty engineered structures  custom signage  manholes  catch basins  highway barriers and curb inlets 
after the concrete sets  we strip the molds from the products and ship the finished product to our customers 
because these products are not perishable  precast concrete plants can serve a much larger market than ready mixed concrete plants 
our precast operations in northern california and delaware are located near our ready mixed concrete operations 
building materials 
our building materials operations supply various resale materials  products and tools contractors use in the concrete construction industry 
these materials include rebar  wire mesh  color additives  curing compounds  grouts  wooden forms and numerous other items 
our building materials operations are located near several of our ready mixed concrete operations in northern california  central new jersey  michigan and delaware 
aggregates 
we produce crushed stone aggregates from our granite quarry in northern new jersey 
we sell these aggregates for use in commercial  residential and public works projects primarily in that area and in orange county  new york 
we acquired the quarry in january principally to expand our market presence in northern new jersey and to provide crushed stone aggregates to third party customers as well as to our existing ready mixed concrete operations in that market 
production during was approximately million tons  and we estimate the quarry has approximately million tons of remaining reserves  assuming a loss factor for unusable material 
in addition  in connection with our december acquisition of substantially all the operating assets of go crete and south loop development corporation  we acquired a sand and gravel quarry in the dallas fort worth  texas area 
the aggregate quarry is situated on  acres and is estimated to have approximately million tons of remaining aggregate reserves 
these aggregate reserves provide us with additional raw materials sourcing flexibility and supply availability 
concrete masonry 
we manufacture various shapes and sizes of concrete masonry  commonly known as concrete block  for use in various applications 
we produced approximately million units of concrete masonry during at our plants in michigan  delaware and new jersey 
all our concrete masonry plants are located near our ready mixed operations and provide us cross selling opportunities in those markets 
operations our ready mixed concrete plants consist of fixed and portable facilities that produce ready mixed concrete in wet or dry batches 
our fixed plant facilities produce ready mixed concrete that we transport to job sites by mixer trucks 
our portable plant operations deploy our seven portable plant facilities to produce ready mixed concrete at the job site that we direct into place using a series of conveyor belts or a mixer truck 
we use our portable plants to service high volume projects or projects in remote locations 
several factors govern the choice of plant type  including production consistency requirements  daily production capacity requirements  and job site proximity to fixed plants 
generally  we will construct wet batch plants to serve markets that we expect will have consistently high demand as opposed to dry batch plants that will serve markets that we expect will have a less consistent demand 
a wet batch plant generally has a higher initial cost and daily operating expense but yields greater consistency with less time required for quality control in the concrete produced and generally has greater daily production capacity than a dry batch plant 
we believe that construction of a wet batch plant having an hourly capacity of cubic yards currently would cost approximately million  while a dry batch plant having the same capacity currently would cost approximately million 
as of march   our fixed batch plants included wet batch plants and dry batch plants 
of our seven portable plants  six are dry batch plants and one is a wet batch plant 
the batch operator in a dry batch plant simultaneously loads the dry components of stone  sand and cement with water and admixtures in a mixer truck that begins the mixing process during loading and completes that process while driving to the job site 
in a wet batch plant  the batch operator blends the dry components and water in a plant mixer from which the operator loads the already mixed concrete into the mixer truck  which leaves for the job site promptly after loading 
any future decisions we make regarding the construction of additional plants will be impacted by market factors  including the expected production demand for the plant  the expected types of projects the plant will service  and the desired location of the plant 
mixer trucks slowly rotate their loads en route to job sites in order to maintain product consistency 
a mixer truck typically has a load capacity of cubic yards  or approximately tons  and an estimated useful life of years 
a new truck of this size currently costs approximately  depending on the type of batch plant from which the mixer trucks generally are loaded  some components of the mixer trucks usually require refurbishment after three to five years 
as of march   we operated a fleet of approximately  mixer trucks  which had an average age of approximately years 
in our ready mixed concrete operations  we emphasize quality control  pre job planning  customer service and coordination of supplies and delivery 
we often obtain purchase orders for ready mixed concrete months in advance of actual delivery 
a typical order contains specifications the contractor requires the concrete to meet 
after receiving the specifications for a particular job  we use computer modeling  industry information and information from previous similar jobs to formulate a variety of mixtures of cement  aggregates  water and admixtures which meet or exceed the contractor s specifications 
we perform testing to determine which mix design is most appropriate to meet the required specifications 
the test results enable us to select the mixture that has the lowest cost and meets or exceeds the job specifications 
the testing center creates and maintains a project file that details the mixture we will use when we produce the concrete for the job 
for quality control purposes  the testing center also is responsible for maintaining batch samples of concrete we have delivered to a job site 
we use computer modeling to prepare bids for particular jobs based on the size of the job  location  desired margin  cost of raw materials and the design mixture identified in our testing process 
if the job is large enough and has a projected duration beyond the supply arrangement in place at that time  we obtain quotes from our suppliers as to the cost of raw materials we use in preparing the bid 
once we obtain a quotation from our suppliers  the price of the raw materials for the specified job is informally established 
several months may elapse from the time a contractor has accepted our bid until actual delivery of the ready mixed concrete begins 
during this time  we maintain regular communication with the contractor concerning the status of the job and any changes in the job s specifications in order to coordinate the multisourced purchases of cement and other materials we will need to fill the job order and meet the contractor s delivery requirements 
we confirm that our customers are ready to take delivery of manufactured product throughout the placement process 
on any given day  a particular plant may have production orders for dozens of customers at various locations throughout its area of operation 
to fill an order the customer service office coordinates the timing and delivery of the concrete to the job site  a load operator supervises and coordinates the receipt of the necessary raw materials and operates the hopper that dispenses those materials into the appropriate storage bins  a batch operator  using a computerized batch panel  prepares the specified mixture from the order and oversees the loading of the mixer truck with either dry ingredients and water in a dry batch plant or the premixed concrete in a wet batch plant  and the driver of the mixer truck delivers the load to the job site  discharges the load and  after washing the truck  departs at the direction of the dispatch office 
the central dispatch system tracks the status of each mixer truck as to whether a particular truck is loading concrete  en route to a particular job site  on the job site  discharging concrete  being washed  or en route to a particular plant 
the system is updated continuously via signals received from the individual truck operators as to their status 
in this manner  the dispatcher can determine the optimal routing and timing of subsequent deliveries by each mixer truck and monitor the performance of each driver 
a plant manager oversees the operation of each plant 
our operational employees also include maintenance personnel who perform routine maintenance work throughout our plants  mechanics who perform substantially all the maintenance and repair work on our rolling stock  testing center staff who prepare mixtures for particular job specifications and maintain quality control  various clerical personnel who perform administrative tasks  and sales personnel who are responsible for identifying potential customers and maintaining existing customer relationships 
we generally operate each of our plants on an extended single shift  with some overtime operation during the year 
on occasion  however  we may have projects that require deliveries around the clock 
cement and other raw materials we obtain most of the materials necessary to manufacture ready mixed concrete on a daily basis 
these materials include cement  which is a manufactured product  stone  gravel and sand 
each plant typically maintains an inventory level of these materials sufficient to satisfy its operating needs for a few days 
cement represents the highest cost material used in manufacturing a cubic yard of ready mixed concrete  while the combined cost of the stone  gravel and sand used is slightly less than the cement cost 
in each of our markets  we purchase each of these materials from several suppliers 
during the last three quarters of  supplies of cement were tight in some of our markets as a result of increased demand for cement  lower inventories of cement  downtime at certain cement plants and insufficient availability to increase imports of cement 
this shortage curtailed some sales of our ready mixed concrete  and cement prices increased  which adversely affected our gross margins 
during the first quarter of  cement shortages temporarily abated  although tightness of supply brought about by strong domestic consumption and insufficient availability of imported cement resulted in a continuation of the cement price increases experienced in the prior year 
during the remainder of  these conditions persisted and we experienced further increases in cement prices in the majority of our markets 
in the second quarter of  we experienced cement shortages in our north texas market that had a negative impact on our operating results through both decreased sales and higher cost of raw materials 
because of expected continued strong domestic consumption and insufficient availability of cement in certain markets  we could experience continued shortages in future periods  which could adversely affect our operating results  through both decreased sales and higher cost of raw materials 
marketing and sales general contractors typically select their suppliers of ready mixed concrete 
in large  complex projects  an engineering firm or division within a state transportation or public works department may influence the purchasing decision  particularly if the concrete has complicated design specifications 
in those projects and in government funded projects generally  the general contractor or project engineer usually awards supply orders on the basis of either direct negotiation or competitive bidding 
we believe the purchasing decision for many jobs ultimately is relationship based 
our marketing efforts target general contractors  developers  design engineers  architects and homebuilders whose focus extends beyond the price of ready mixed concrete to product quality and consistency and reducing the in place cost of concrete 
customers of our sales  we made approximately to commercial and industrial construction contractors  to residential construction contractors  to street and highway construction contractors and to other public works and infrastructure contractors 
in  no single customer or project accounted for more than of our total sales 
we rely heavily on repeat customers 
our management and sales personnel are responsible for developing and maintaining successful long term relationships with key customers 
competition the ready mixed concrete industry is highly competitive 
our competitive position in a market depends largely on the location and operating costs of our ready mixed concrete plants and prevailing prices in that market 
price is the primary competitive factor among suppliers for small or simple jobs  principally in residential construction  while timeliness of delivery and consistency of quality and service along with price are the principal competitive factors among suppliers for large or complex jobs 
our competitors range from small  owner operated private companies to subsidiaries or operating units of large  vertically integrated manufacturers of cement and aggregates 
our vertically integrated competitors generally have greater manufacturing  financial and marketing resources than we have  providing them with a competitive advantage 
competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do will have a competitive advantage over us for jobs that are particularly price sensitive 
competitors having greater financial resources also may have competitive advantages over us 
see risk factors we may lose business to competitors who underbid us and we may be otherwise unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry 
employees as of march   we had approximately salaried employees  including executive officers and management  sales  technical  administrative and clerical personnel  and approximately  hourly personnel 
the number of employees fluctuates depending on the number and size of projects ongoing at any particular time  which may be impacted by variations in weather conditions throughout the year 
as of march   approximately of our employees were represented by labor unions having collective bargaining agreements with us 
generally  these agreements have multi year terms and expire on a staggered basis between and under these agreements  we pay specified wages to covered employees and make payments to multi employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts rather than administering the funds on behalf of these employees 
other than a two day strike at certain operations within our atlantic region in  we have not experienced any strikes or significant work stoppages in the past five years 
we believe our relationships with our employees and union representatives are satisfactory 
training and safety our future success will depend  in part  on the extent to which we can attract  retain and motivate qualified employees 
we believe that our ability to do so will depend on the quality of our recruiting  training  compensation and benefits  the opportunities we afford for advancement and our safety record 
we support and fund continuing education and training programs for our employees 
we intend to continue and expand these programs 
we require all field employees to attend periodic safety training meetings and all drivers and other delivery personnel to participate in training seminars 
we employ a national safety director whose responsibilities include managing and executing a unified  company wide safety program 
governmental regulation and environmental matters a wide range of federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations apply to our operations  including the following matters land usage  street and highway usage  noise levels  and health  safety and environmental matters 
in many instances  we are required to have various certificates  permits or licenses to conduct our business 
our failure to maintain these required authorizations or to comply with applicable laws or other governmental requirements could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations 
delays in obtaining approvals for the transfer or grant of authorizations  or failures to obtain new authorizations  could impede acquisition efforts 
environmental laws that impact our operations include those relating to air quality  solid waste management and water quality 
these laws are complex and subject to frequent change 
they impose strict liability in some cases without regard to negligence or fault 
sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits  corrective action orders  administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution 
some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances 
in addition  businesses may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances  as well as damage to natural resources 
these laws also may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  or for acts that complied with all applicable laws when performed 
we have conducted phase i investigations to assess environmental conditions on substantially all the real properties we own or lease and have engaged independent environmental consulting firms to complete those assessments 
we have not identified any environmental concerns associated with those properties that we believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows  but we can provide no assurance material liabilities will not occur 
in addition  we can provide no assurance our compliance with amended  new or more stringent laws  stricter interpretations of existing laws or the future discovery of environmental conditions will not require additional  material expenditures 
osha regulations establish requirements our training programs must meet 
we have all material permits and licenses we need to conduct our operations and are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our operations 
our capital expenditures relating to environmental matters were not material in we currently do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as a result of our future compliance with existing environmental laws controlling the discharge of materials into the environment 
product warranties our operations involve providing ready mixed and other concrete formulations that must meet building code or other regulatory requirements and contractual specifications for durability  stress level capacity  weight bearing capacity and other characteristics 
if we fail or are unable to provide product  meeting these requirements and specifications  material claims may arise against us and our reputation could be damaged 
in the past  we have had significant claims of this kind asserted against us that we have resolved 
there currently are  and we expect that in the future there will be  additional claims of this kind asserted against us 
if a significant product related claim is resolved against us in the future  that resolution may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
insurance our employees perform a significant portion of their work moving and storing large quantities of heavy raw materials  driving large mixer trucks in heavy traffic conditions and delivering concrete at construction sites or in other areas that may be hazardous 
these operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  damage to or destruction of properties and equipment and environmental damage 
we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks we believe accord with industry practice  but this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations  and we may be unable to maintain insurance of the types or at levels we deem necessary or adequate or at rates we consider reasonable 
for additional discussion of our insurance programs  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
item a 
risk factors set forth below and under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks and uncertainties in item of part i of this report are various risks and uncertainties that could adversely impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
there are risks related to our internal growth and operating strategy 
our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by  among other factors  our ability to attract new customers  differentiate ourselves in a competitive market by emphasizing new product development and value added sales and marketing  hire and retain employees  and reduce operating and overhead expenses 
one key component of our operating strategy is to operate our businesses on a decentralized basis  with local or regional management retaining responsibility for day to day operations  profitability and the internal growth of the individual business 
if we do not implement and maintain proper overall business controls  this decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices and our overall profitability could be adversely affected 
our resources  including management resources  are limited and may be strained if we engage in a significant number of acquisitions 
also  acquisitions may divert our management s attention from initiating or carrying out programs to save costs or enhance revenues 
our inability to achieve internal growth could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operating results may vary significantly from one reporting period to another and may be adversely affected by the seasonal and cyclical nature of the markets we serve 
the ready mixed concrete business is seasonal 
in particular  demand for our products and services during the winter months is typically lower than in other months because of inclement winter weather 
in addition  sustained periods of inclement weather or permitting delays could postpone or delay projects over geographic regions of the united states and consequently could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the relative demand for ready mixed concrete is a function of the highly cyclical construction industry 
as a result  our revenues may be adversely affected by declines in the construction industry generally and in our local markets for ready mixed concrete and other concrete products 
our results also may be materially affected by the level of residential and commercial construction in our regional markets  including possible reductions in the demand for new residential housing construction below current levels  the availability of funds for public or infrastructure construction from local  state and federal sources  unexpected events that delay or adversely affect our ability to deliver concrete according to our customers requirements  changes in interest rates  the changes in mix of our customers and business  which result in periodic variations in the margins of jobs performed during any particular quarter  the timing and cost of acquisitions and difficulties or costs encountered when integrating acquisitions  the budgetary spending patterns of customers  increases in construction and design costs  power outages and other unexpected delays  our ability to control costs and maintain quality  employment levels  and regional or general economic conditions 
as a result  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for the entire year 
furthermore  negative trends in the ready mixed concrete industry or in our geographic markets could have material adverse effects on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unsuccessful in continuing to carry out our strategy of growth through acquisitions 
one of our principal growth strategies is to increase our revenues and the markets we serve and to continue entering new geographic markets through the acquisition of additional ready mixed concrete and related businesses 
we may not be able to acquire suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices and on other reasonable terms for a number of reasons  including the following the acquisition candidates we identify may be unwilling to sell  we may not have sufficient capital to pay for acquisitions  and competitors in our industry may outbid us 
in addition  there are risks associated with the acquisitions we complete 
we may face difficulties integrating the newly acquired businesses into our operations efficiently and on a timely basis 
we also may experience unforeseen difficulties managing the increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations or mitigating contingent or assumed liabilities  potentially including liabilities we do not anticipate 
we may lose business to competitors who underbid us  and we may be otherwise unable to compete favorably in our highly competitive industry 
our competitive position in a given market depends largely on the location and operating costs of our ready mixed concrete plants and prevailing prices in that market 
generally  ready mixed concrete is price sensitive 
our prices are subject to changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand  general economic conditions and market conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
because of the fixed cost nature of our business  our overall profitability is sensitive to minor variations in sales volumes and small shifts in the balance between supply and demand 
price is the primary competitive factor among suppliers for small or simple jobs  principally in residential construction  while timeliness of delivery and consistency of quality and service  as well as price  are the principal competitive factors among suppliers for large or complex jobs 
concrete manufacturers like us generally obtain customer contracts through local sales and marketing efforts directed at general contractors  developers and homebuilders 
as a result  we depend on local relationships 
our competitors range from small  owner operated private companies to subsidiaries or operating units of large  vertically integrated manufacturers of cement and aggregates 
our vertically integrated competitors generally have greater manufacturing  financial and marketing resources than we have  providing them with a competitive advantage 
competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do will have a competitive advantage over us for jobs that are particularly price sensitive 
competitors having greater financial resources or less financial leverage than we do to invest in new mixer trucks  build plants in new areas or pay for acquisitions also will have competitive advantages over us 
we depend on third parties for concrete equipment and supplies essential to operate our business 
we rely on third parties to lease properties  plant and equipment to us and to provide supplies  including cement and other raw materials  necessary for our operations 
we cannot assure you that our favorable working relationships with our suppliers will continue in the future 
also  there have historically been periods of supply shortages in the concrete industry  particularly in a strong economy 
if we are unable to lease necessary properties or equipment  our operations could be severely impacted 
if we lose our supply contracts and receive insufficient supplies from other third parties to meet our customers needs or if our suppliers experience price increases or disruptions to their business  such as labor disputes  supply shortages or distribution problems  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
during the last three quarters of  supplies of cement were tight in some of our markets as a result of increased demand for cement  lower inventories of cement  downtime at certain cement plants and insufficient availability to increase imports of cement 
this shortage curtailed some sales of our ready mixed concrete  and cement prices increased  which adversely affected our gross margins 
during the first quarter of  cement shortages temporarily abated  although tightness of supply brought about by strong domestic consumption and insufficient availability of imported cement resulted in a continuation of the cement price increases experienced in the prior year 
in the second and third quarters of  these conditions persisted and we experienced further increases in cement prices in the majority of our markets 
during the second quarter of  we experienced cement shortages in our north texas market that had a negative impact on our operating results through both decreased sales and higher cost of raw materials 
because of expected continued strong domestic consumption and insufficient availability of cement in certain markets  we could experience continued shortages in future periods  which could adversely affect our operating results  through both decreased sales and higher cost of raw materials 
throughout  our product pricing for ready mixed concrete continued to increase in most of our markets 
these price increases have allowed us to absorb the rising cost of raw materials primarily cement and aggregates 
however  gains on increased prices were offset in part by higher labor  freight and delivery costs  including rising diesel fuel costs 
with the national average of diesel fuel prices having risen in as compared to  we have experienced both increased freight charges for our raw materials  in the form of fuel surcharges  and increased cost to deliver our products 
as these costs have become more significant over the last two years  we have instituted fuel surcharges in most of our markets in an attempt to cover these rising costs 
we do not have any long term fuel supply contracts that would protect us from rising fuel costs 
sustaining or improving our margins in the future will depend on market conditions and our ability to increase our product pricing or realize gains in productivity to offset further increases in raw materials and other costs 
governmental regulations  including environmental regulations  may result in increases in our operating costs and capital expenditures and decreases in our earnings 
a wide range of federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations apply to our operations  including the following matters land usage  street and highway usage  noise levels  and health  safety and environmental matters 
in many instances  we must have various certificates  permits or licenses in order to conduct our business 
our failure to maintain required certificates  permits or licenses or to comply with applicable governmental requirements could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations 
delays in obtaining approvals for the transfer or grant of certificates  permits or licenses  or failure to obtain new certificates  permits or licenses  could impede the implementation of our acquisition program 
governmental requirements that impact our operations include those relating to air quality  solid waste management and water quality 
these requirements are complex and subject to frequent change 
they impose strict liability in some cases without regard to negligence or fault and may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them 
our compliance with amended  new or more stringent requirements  stricter interpretations of existing requirements or the future discovery of environmental conditions may require us to make unanticipated material expenditures 
in addition  we may fail to identify or obtain indemnification from environmental liabilities of acquired businesses 
we generally do not maintain insurance to cover environmental liabilities 
in march  the california regional water quality control board for the central valley region issued a draft order to regulate discharges of concrete wastewater and solid wastes associated with concrete manufacturing at ready mixed concrete plants located in and near sacramento  california 
this order would affect four sites in which six of our ready mixed concrete plants operate in northern california 
if approved in its current draft form  the order would require all existing ready mixed concrete plants in the area to retrofit or reconstruct their waste management units to provide impermeable containment of all concrete wastewater and install leak detection systems 
it also would require all new ready mixed concrete plants in the area to be constructed with similar waste management units 
the draft order provides that operators of existing ready mixed concrete plants would have days to apply for coverage under the order  and then one year after coverage is obtained to complete all required retrofitting 
in june  the california regional water quality control board for the central valley region delayed approval of the order to provide the construction materials association of california and various concrete producers time to provide certain information to it for further consideration 
although our actual capital expenditures may vary significantly and will ultimately depend on final regulations  if the order is approved in its current form  the cost of capital improvements to our plants at the four sites in the affected area may be up to million per site 
also  if the order is considered and adopted by the california water quality control board for the san francisco bay region  we might incur similar costs to retrofit our existing plants in that area 
our operations are subject to various hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage and increase our operating costs 
operating mixer trucks  particularly when loaded  exposes our drivers and others to traffic hazards 
our drivers are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing services on construction sites  while our plant personnel are subject to the hazards associated with moving and storing large quantities of heavy raw materials 
operating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  damage to or destruction of properties  plant and equipment and environmental damage 
although we conduct training programs designed to reduce these risks  we cannot eliminate these risks 
we maintain insurance coverage in amounts we believe are in accord with industry practice  however  this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in our operations  and we may not be able to maintain insurance of the types or at levels we deem necessary or adequate or at rates we consider reasonable 
a partially or completely uninsured claim  if successful and of sufficient magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on us 
the insurance policies we maintain are subject to varying levels of deductibles 
losses up to the deductible amounts are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
if we were to experience insurance claims or costs above our estimates  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows might be materially and adversely affected 
the departure of key personnel could disrupt our business  and our business growth will necessitate the successful hiring of new senior managers and executive officers 
we depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and  in many cases  on senior management of our businesses 
our success will depend on recruiting new senior level managers and officers  and we cannot be certain that we can recruit and retain such additional managers and officers 
to the extent we are unable to manage our growth effectively or are unable to attract and retain qualified management personnel  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees 
we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 
our ability to provide high quality products and services on a timely basis depends on our success in employing an adequate number of skilled plant managers  technicians and drivers 
like many of our competitors  we experience shortages of qualified personnel from time to time 
we may not be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy  and our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 
collective bargaining agreements  work stoppages and other labor relations matters may result in increases in our operating costs  disruptions in our business and decreases in our earnings 
as of march   approximately of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements  which expire between and of particular note  of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in our inability to negotiate acceptable new contracts or extensions of existing contracts with these unions could cause strikes or other work stoppages by the affected employees 
in addition  any new contracts or extensions could result in increased operating costs attributable to both union and nonunion employees 
if any such strikes or other work stoppages were to occur  or if other of our employees were to become represented by a union  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and higher ongoing labor costs  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the coexistence of union and nonunion employees may lead to conflicts between union and nonunion employees or impede our ability to integrate our operations efficiently 
also  labor relations matters affecting our suppliers of cement and aggregates could adversely impact our business from time to time 
we contribute to multiemployer pension plans 
if we were to withdraw partially or completely from any plan that is underfunded  we would be liable for a proportionate share of that plan s unfunded vested benefits 
based on the limited information available from plan administrators  which we cannot independently validate  we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full or partial withdrawal from or termination of several of these plans would be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our overall profitability is sensitive to price changes and minor variations in sales volumes 
generally  ready mixed concrete is price sensitive 
prices for our products are subject to changes in response to relatively minor fluctuations in supply and demand  general economic conditions and market conditions  all of which are beyond our control 
because of the fixed cost nature of our business  our overall profitability is sensitive to price changes and minor variations in sales volumes 
we may incur material costs and losses as a result of claims our products do not meet regulatory requirements or contractual specifications 
our operations involve providing products that must meet building code or other regulatory requirements and contractual specifications for durability  stress level capacity  weight bearing capacity and other characteristics 
if we fail or are unable to provide products meeting these requirements and specifications  material claims may arise against us and our reputation could be damaged 
in the past  we have had significant claims of this kind asserted against us that we have resolved 
there currently are  and we expect that in the future there will be  additional claims of this kind asserted against us 
if a significant product related claim or claims are resolved against us in the future  that resolution may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our net sales attributable to infrastructure projects could be negatively impacted by a decrease or delay in governmental spending 
our business depends in part on the level of governmental spending on infrastructure projects in our markets 
reduced levels of governmental funding for public works projects or delays in that funding could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
some of our plants are susceptible to damage from earthquakes  for which we have a limited amount of insurance 
we maintain only a limited amount of earthquake insurance  and  therefore  we are not fully insured against earthquake risk 
any significant earthquake damage to our plants could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairments 
goodwill represents the amount by which the total purchase price we have paid for acquisitions exceeds our estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
we periodically test our recorded goodwill for impairment and charge expense with any impairment we recognize  but do not otherwise amortize that goodwill 
as of december   goodwill represented approximately of our total assets 
we can provide no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
if we determine that any of our remaining balance of goodwill is impaired  we will be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings 
as a result of capital constraints and other factors  we may not be able to grow as rapidly as we may desire through acquiring additional businesses 
in addition to our existing working capital and cash from operations  our senior secured credit facility provides us with a significant source of liquidity 
that facility provides us a borrowing capacity of up to million 
the credit agreement relating to this facility provides that the administrative agent may  on the bases specified  reduce the amount of the available credit from time to time 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility and the amount of the available credit was approximately million  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
we cannot readily predict the timing  size and success of our acquisition efforts or the capital we will need for those efforts 
we may use our common stock as a component of the consideration we pay for future acquisitions 
issuances of common stock as acquisition consideration could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
if our common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value or potential acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept our common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  we may be required to use more of our cash resources to pursue our acquisition program 
using cash for acquisition consideration limits our financial flexibility and increases the likelihood that we will need to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings 
if we seek more debt financing  we may have to agree to financial covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility 
additional equity financing may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders 
there is no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms acceptable to us 
our substantial debt could adversely affect our financial condition 
we currently have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding debt 
our substantial debt and other financial obligations could make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  increase our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or the industry in which we compete  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes  place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors  and limit our ability to plan for and react to changes in our business and the ready mixed concrete industry 
we will require a significant amount of cash to service all our debt 
our ability to pay or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future financings may not be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or fund other liquidity needs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations  we may have to renegotiate the terms of our debt or obtain additional financing  possibly on less favorable terms than our current debt 
if we are not able to renegotiate the terms of our debt or obtain additional financing  we could be forced to sell assets under unfavorable circumstances 
the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limit our ability to sell assets and generally restrict the use of proceeds from asset sales 
our existing debt arrangements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
the indenture governing our million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes and our senior secured credit facility contain covenants that restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  pay dividends  make asset sales  make certain investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  incur liens on assets to secure other debt  engage in specified business activities  and engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets 
in addition  our indenture and senior secured credit facility contain financial covenants and other limitations with which we must comply 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and our future operating results may not be sufficient to comply with the covenants or  in the event of a default under either our indenture or senior secured credit facility  to remedy such a covenant default 
our failure to comply with any of our financial or other covenants under our indenture or senior secured credit facility could result in an event of default 
on the occurrence of any such event of default  the trustee under the indenture or our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the indenture or our senior secured credit facility  as applicable  to be immediately due and payable  and our lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit to us and foreclose on any collateral we have granted to secure our obligations under our senior secured credit facility

our actual results  performance or achievements  or industry results  could differ materially from those we express in the following discussion as a result of a variety of factors  including the risks and uncertainties to which we refer under the headings cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements preceding item of this report  risk factors in item a of this report and risks and uncertainties below 
overview we derive substantially all our revenues from the sale of ready mixed concrete  other concrete products and related construction materials to the construction industry in the united states 
we typically sell ready mixed concrete under purchase orders that require us to formulate  prepare and deliver the product to our customers job sites 
we recognize sales from these orders when we deliver the ordered products 
the principal states in which we operate are california of sales and of sales  new jersey of sales and of sales  michigan of sales and of sales and texas of sales and of sales 
we serve substantially all segments of the construction industry in our markets  and our customers include contractors for commercial and industrial  residential  street and highway and public works construction 
the approximate percentages of our concrete product sales by construction type activity were as follows in and residential commercial and industrial street and highway other public works the markets for our products generally are local  and our operating results are subject to swings in the level and product mix of construction activity that occur in our markets 
the level of activity affects the demand for our products  while the product mix among the various segments of the construction industry affects both our relative competitive strengths and our operating margins  as ready mixed concrete sold for commercial and industrial construction is generally more technical and  therefore  more profitable than that sold for residential construction 
commercial and industrial jobs also provide ready mixed concrete producers more opportunities to sell value added concrete mix designs for various high performance requirements that often include admixtures  such as chemicals  minerals and fibers  or color conditioning additives 
the ready mixed concrete business is subject to seasonal variations 
in particular  demand for our products and services during the winter months is typically lower than in other months of the year because of inclement weather 
in addition  sustained periods of inclement weather and other weather conditions could postpone or delay projects in our markets 
during the first four months of  we experienced sustained adverse weather conditions and permitting delays that exceeded historical norms for this period  primarily in our california markets  which resulted in lower than expected sales volume during that period 
in the following eight months  we experienced more normalized weather conditions  which enabled us to begin to achieve production levels and related efficiencies more consistent with management s expectations 
should we experience sustained adverse weather in our markets in the future  our sales volumes and results of operations would be adversely affected 
during the last three quarters of  supplies of cement were tight in some of our markets as a result of increased demand for cement  lower inventories of cement  downtime at certain cement plants and insufficient availability to increase imports of cement 
this shortage curtailed some sales of our ready mixed concrete  and cement prices increased  which adversely affected our gross margins 
during the first quarter of  cement shortages temporarily abated  although tightness of supply brought about by strong domestic consumption and insufficient availability of imported cement resulted in a continuation of the cement price increases experienced in the prior year 
during the remainder of  these conditions persisted and we experienced further increases in cement prices in the majority of our markets 
in the second quarter of  we experienced cement shortages in our north texas market that had a negative impact on our operating results through both decreased sales and higher cost of raw materials 
because of expected continued strong domestic consumption and insufficient availability of cement in certain markets  we could experience continued shortages in future periods  which could adversely affect our operating results  through both decreased sales and higher cost of raw materials 
throughout  our product pricing for ready mixed concrete continued to increase in most of our markets 
these price increases have allowed us to absorb the rising cost of raw materials primarily cement and aggregates 
however  gains on increased prices were offset in part by higher labor  freight and delivery costs  including rising diesel fuel costs 
diesel fuel prices peaked in the third quarter of in the aftermath of hurricane katrina and declined somewhat over the fourth quarter of  with the national average of diesel fuel prices ending the year above as a result of these fuel price increases  we have experienced both increased freight charges for our raw materials in the form of fuel surcharges and increased cost to deliver our products 
as these costs have become more significant over the last two years  we have instituted fuel surcharges in most of our markets in an attempt to cover these rising costs 
we do not have any long term fuel supply contracts that would protect us from rising fuel costs 
sustaining or improving our margins in the future will depend on market conditions and our ability to increase our product pricing or realize gains in productivity to offset further increases in raw materials and other costs 
our cost of goods sold consists principally of the costs we incur in obtaining the cement  aggregates and admixtures we combine to produce ready mixed concrete and other concrete products 
we obtain most of these materials from third parties and generally have only a few days supply at each of our plants 
these costs vary with our levels of production 
our cost of goods sold also includes labor costs  primarily for delivery personnel  and insurance costs and the operating  maintenance and rental expenses we incur in operating our plants  mixer trucks and other vehicles 
since our inception in  our growth strategy has contemplated acquisitions 
we purchased one business in  one business in and three businesses in  all of which we have accounted for in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
please read liquidity and capital resources acquisitions for further information regarding our recent acquisitions 
the rate and extent to which appropriate further acquisition opportunities are available  and the extent to which acquired businesses are integrated and anticipated synergies and cost savings are achieved can affect our operations and results 
risks and uncertainties numerous factors could affect our future operating results  including the factors discussed under the heading risk factors in item a of this report and the following factors 
internal computer network and applications 
we rely on our network infrastructure  enterprise applications and internal technology systems for our operational  support and sales activities 
the hardware and software systems related to such activities are subject to damage from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures and other similar events 
they are also subject to computer viruses  physical or electronic vandalism or other similar disruptions that could cause system interruptions  delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders 
we have developed disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effects of such events 
any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could result in disruption in our business operations  loss of revenues or damage to our reputation 
accounting rules and regulations 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows accounting for share based payments  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for business combinations and related goodwill 
in particular  the financial accounting standards board the fasb recently adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  which will require us to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on the consolidated net income in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements 
see recent accounting pronouncements and note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of sfas no 
r 
tax liabilities 
we are subject to federal  state and local income taxes  applicable to corporations generally  as well as nonincome based taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  we make calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are also from time to time under audit by state and local tax authorities 
although we can provide no assurance that the final determination of our tax liabilities will not differ from what our historical income tax provisions and accruals reflect  we believe our tax estimates are reasonable 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report describes the significant accounting policies we use in preparing those statements 
we believe the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to our financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving our management s judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review outstanding receivables and provide for estimated losses on accounts receivable we believe we may not collect in full 
a provision for bad debt expense recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses increases the allowance  and accounts receivable that we write off our books decrease the allowance 
we determine the amount of bad debt expense we record each period and the resulting adequacy of the allowance at the end of each period by using a combination of our historical loss experience  customer by customer analyses of our accounts receivable balances each period and subjective assessments of our bad debt exposure 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of december  and million as of december  goodwill we record as goodwill the amount by which the total purchase price we pay for our acquisitions exceeds our estimated fair value of the net assets we acquire 
we test our recorded goodwill annually for impairment and charge income with any impairment we recognize  but we do not otherwise amortize that goodwill 
the impairment test we use consists of comparing our estimates of the current fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts 
we use a variety of valuation approaches  primarily the discounted future cash flow approach  to arrive at these estimates 
these approaches entail making numerous assumptions respecting future circumstances  such as general or local industry or market conditions  and  therefore  are uncertain 
we did not record a goodwill impairment charge in  or we can provide no assurance that future goodwill impairments will not occur 
our goodwill balance was million as of december  and million as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for further discussion 
insurance programs we maintain third party insurance coverage in amounts and against the risks we believe are reasonable 
under our current insurance programs  we share the risk of loss with our insurance underwriters by maintaining high deductibles subject to aggregate annual loss limitations 
currently  our workers compensation per occurrence retention is million and our automobile and general liability per occurrence retention is million 
we fund these deductibles and record an expense for losses we expect under the programs 
we determine the expected losses using a combination of our historical loss experience and subjective assessments of our future loss exposure 
the estimated losses are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including changes in claims reporting and settlement patterns  judicial decisions  new legislation and economic conditions 
although we believe the estimated losses are reasonable  significant differences related to the items we have noted above could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense 
the amount accrued for self insurance claims was million as of december  and million as of december   which is currently classified in accrued liabilities 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we record deferred income taxes based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and use enacted tax rates and laws that we expect will be in effect when we recover those assets or settle those liabilities  as the case may be  to measure those taxes 
we believe our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
in cases where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely  we would provide for a valuation allowance 
we have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that may reduce taxable income in future periods 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes in statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances  recorded in connection with a business combination  will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
we recorded no valuation allowance at december  or december  inventory obsolescence we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for those products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
properties  plant and equipment  net we state our properties  plant and equipment at cost and use the straight line method to compute depreciation of these assets over their estimated remaining useful lives 
our estimates of those lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in our industry or changes in applicable regulations 
in addition  we use estimates of salvage values for certain plant and equipment to reduce the cost which is subject to depreciation 
we evaluate the recoverability of our properties  plant and equipment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we compare the carrying value of long lived assets to our projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
actual useful lives and future cash flows could be different from those we estimate 
these differences could have a material effect on our future operating results 
other we record accruals for legal and other contingencies when estimated future expenditures associated with those contingencies become probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and  therefore  a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change

results of operations the following table sets forth selected historical statement of operations information and that information as a percentage of sales for the years indicated 
year ended december amounts in thousands  except selling prices sales cost of goods sold before depreciation  depletion and amortization selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation  depletion and amortization income from operations interest income interest expense loss on early extinguishment of debt other income  net income loss before income tax provision income tax provision benefit net income loss ready mixed concrete data average selling price per cubic yard sales volume in cubic yards year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the average sales price of ready mixed concrete  a increase in ready mixed concrete sales volume  and an increase in other sales 
the price improvement in resulted from continued strength in the residential construction market  as well as an improving non residential construction market which was reflective of the strength of the overall economy in cost of goods sold before depreciation  depletion and amortization 
cost of goods sold before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to raw materials cost increases primarily cement and aggregates and increased sales volumes of ready mixed concrete in as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was attributable to higher compensation expenses  including incentive and stock based compensation expenses  higher professional fees and provision for bad debts 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to higher capital expenditures in as compared to interest income 
interest income increased million from million in to million in  primarily as a result of a higher average cash balance in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  from million in to million in the period included the benefit of an interest rate swap for the full year  which reduced interest expense by million 
in june  the interest rate swap agreements were terminated 
we describe the impact of this termination under liquidity and capital resources interest rate swaps 
the weighted average interest rate on our debt was at december   as compared to as of december  loss on early extinguishment of debt 
as a result of our refinancings we describe under liquidity and capital resources senior subordinated notes  we recognized an ordinary loss in on early extinguishment of debt of million  which consisted of million in premium payments to redeem our prior senior subordinated notes and a write off of million of debt issuance costs associated with our debt repayments 
we had no such loss in other income  net 
other income  net  increased million  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to a million gain from the sale of an fcc license 
income tax provision 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in compared to a benefit for income taxes of million in the income tax benefit was attributable to the loss on early extinguishment of debt in our estimated annualized effective tax rate was for the full year ended december  and for the full year ended december  the effective income tax rate for was higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the volume of other concrete product sales and a increase in average selling price of ready mixed concrete 
the price improvement was primarily due to a stable residential construction market and moderate improvements in nonresidential construction in most of our markets during  reflecting the general state of the overall economy  and employment levels in the united states 
adverse weather conditions in the fourth quarter of  particularly in northern california  resulted in lower sales volumes 
cost of goods sold before depreciation  depletion and amortization 
cost of goods sold before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was primarily related to the rise in cement  raw material  labor  insurance and diesel fuel costs during the year 
in  cost of goods sold before depreciation  depletion and amortization included a million correction of an inventory overstatement 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase was attributable to asset impairments and write downs related to properties and equipment million  increases in professional fees million  and higher salary and benefit expenses million in  primarily due to higher stock based and incentive based compensation and group health insurance costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased million  or  from million in to million in interest expense 
our interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by approximately million in interest expense decreased million  or  from million in to million in  as a result of our refinancings and interest rate swaps 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings totaling million  as compared to million as of december  our weighted average interest rate was  after giving effect to our interest rate swaps  as of december   as compared to as of december  loss on early extinguishment of debt 
as a result of our refinancings we describe under liquidity and capital resources senior subordinated notes  we recognized an ordinary loss in on early extinguishment of debt of million  which consisted of million in premium payments to redeem our prior senior subordinated notes and a write off of million of debt issuance costs associated with our debt repayments 
other income  net 
other income  net  decreased to million  or  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a million settlement we recorded in in connection with a claim we filed against the former owners of a subsidiary in our atlantic region 
for additional information  see note to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
income tax provision 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million in  compared to a provision for income taxes of million in the benefit resulted principally from the taxable loss generated from our debt refinancings 
our effective tax rate was for and for the effective income tax rate for was greater than the federal statutory rate due primarily to state income tax benefits and nontaxable settlement income increasing the federal tax benefit related to the estimated current year loss 
liquidity and capital resources our primary short term liquidity needs consist of financing seasonal working capital requirements  purchasing properties and equipment and paying cash interest expense under our senior subordinated notes due in april and cash interest expense  if any  under our senior secured revolving credit facility that expires in march in addition to cash and cash equivalents of million at december  and cash from operations  our senior secured revolving credit facility provides us with a significant source of liquidity 
that facility provides us a borrowing capacity of up to million 
the credit agreement relating to this facility provides that the administrative agent may  on the bases specified  reduce the amount of the available credit from time to time 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility and the amount of that available credit was approximately million  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
our working capital needs typically increase in the second and third quarters to finance the increases in accounts receivable during those periods and the cash interest payment on our senior subordinated notes due on april of each year 
generally  in the fourth quarter of each year  our working capital borrowings begin to decline and then are paid down to their lowest annual levels in the first quarter of the following year 
the principal factors that could adversely affect the amount of our internally generated funds include any deterioration of sales because of weakness in the markets in which we operate  any decline in gross margins due to shifts in our project mix  and the extent to which we are unable to generate internal growth through integration of additional businesses or capital expansions of our existing business 
the principal factors that could adversely affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include covenants contained in our credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes  volatility in the markets for corporate debt  and fluctuations in the market price of our common stock or senior subordinated notes 
the following key financial measurements reflect our financial position and capital resources as of december   and dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital total debt available credit debt as a percent of capital employed at december   current maturities of long term debt reduced our working capital by million 
the interest rate swap mark to market adjustments of million in are not included in the total debt 
based on eligible borrowing base in and  net of outstanding letters of credit  and maximum leverage ratios in our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments in deposits and money market funds we hold at major banks 
senior secured credit facility the borrowings under our credit facility are limited based on a portion of the net amounts of our eligible accounts receivable  inventory and mixer trucks 
at our option  these borrowings will bear annual interest at either the eurodollar based rate libor plus  or the domestic rate plus as of december  the interest rate margins will vary inversely with the amount of unused borrowing capacity available under the facility 
we pay commitment fees at an annual rate of on the unused portion of the facility 
our subsidiaries have guaranteed the repayment of all amounts owing under our credit facility 
in addition  we have collateralized the facility with the capital stock and substantially all the assets of our subsidiaries  excluding minor subsidiaries without operations or material assets  and substantially all the assets of those subsidiaries  excluding most of the assets of our aggregate quarry in new jersey 
the credit agreement contains covenants restricting  among other things  prepayment or redemption of subordinated notes  distributions  dividends and repurchases of capital stock and other equity interests  acquisitions and investments  mergers  asset sales other than in the ordinary course of business  indebtedness  liens  changes in our business  changes to charter documents and affiliate transactions 
it also limits capital expenditures to of consolidated revenues in the prior months and will require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to on a rolling month basis if the available credit under the facility falls below million 
the credit agreement provides that specified change of control events would constitute events of default under the agreement 
at december   no borrowings were outstanding under the revolving credit facility  and we had used million of availability under the credit agreement for letters of credit 
the credit agreement limits our ability to incur additional debt primarily to the greater of the borrowings available under our credit facility  plus million  or additional debt if  after giving effect to its incurrence  our total debt does not exceed three times our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and certain noncash items 
senior subordinated notes on march   we issued and sold  through a private placement  million of senior subordinated notes maturing april  interest on these notes is payable semiannually on april and october of each year 
we used the net proceeds of this financing to redeem our prior senior subordinated notes and prepay outstanding debt under our senior secured credit facility 
we paid million to redeem our prior senior subordinated notes  including a prepayment premium of million  plus all accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date of million 
our subsidiaries  excluding minor subsidiaries  have jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
the indenture governing these notes limits our ability and that of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or repurchase common stock  make certain investments  incur additional debt or sell preferred stock  create liens  merge or transfer assets 
at any time prior to april   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings 
in addition  after march   we may redeem all or a part of the notes at a redemption price of in  in  in and in and thereafter 
the indenture requires us to offer to repurchase an aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes equal to the proceeds of certain asset sales that are not reinvested in our business or used to pay senior debt and all the notes following the occurrence of a change of control 
our senior secured credit agreement prohibits these repurchases 
on may   we filed a registration statement with the sec  which became effective on june   pursuant to which we exchanged our outstanding million senior subordinated notes for notes that are substantially identical  except that the offering of the new notes was registered under the securities act of as a result of restrictions contained in the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes  our ability to incur additional debt is primarily limited to the greater of borrowings available under our senior secured credit facility  plus the greater of million or of our tangible assets  or additional debt if  after giving effect to such incurrence of such additional debt  our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and certain noncash items equals or exceeds two times our total interest expense 
interest rate swaps effective april   we entered into interest rate swap agreements that had the economic effect of modifying the interest obligations associated with million of our senior subordinated notes  such that the interest payable on these notes effectively was to become variable based on the six month libor rate  set on april and october of each year 
we terminated these interest rate swap agreements in june the swaps had been designated as fair value hedges and had no ineffective portion 
the notional amounts of the swaps matched the principal amounts of the hedged portion of the notes  and the termination dates of the swaps matched the maturity date of the senior subordinated notes 
as a result of the swaps  the interest rate on the hedged portion of the notes was libor plus 
the swap agreements were marked to market each quarter  with a corresponding mark to market adjustment reflected as either a discount or premium on the senior subordinated notes 
because the swap agreements were considered an effective fair value hedge  there was no affect on our results of operations from these adjustments while the swap agreements were in effect 
upon termination of these interest rate swap agreements  we received million in cash as settlement proceeds 
the cash proceeds have been included in changes in operating assets and liabilities  excluding effects of acquisitions within the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
the cash received has been recorded against the fair values of the respective agreements and the resulting net gain of million is being amortized over the remaining life of the underlying debt instruments as an adjustment to interest expense 
there were no interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  during the year ended december   the interest rate swap agreements reduced our interest expense by approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of their short term maturity and variable rates of interest 
the estimated aggregate fair value of our senior subordinated notes at december  was approximately million and million in debt ratings our ability to obtain external financing and the related cost of borrowing is affected by our debt ratings  which are periodically reviewed by the major credit rating agencies 
debt ratings and outlooks as of march  were as follows rating outlook moody s senior subordinated notes b issuer rating b stable senior implied rating b standard poor s senior subordinated notes b corporate credit b stable these debt ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities  and they may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
future capital requirements for  our capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of million to million 
however  depending on the percentage of equipment acquired under operating leases  our capital expenditures could be in the range of to million 
in recent years  we have leased a higher percentage of our mixer trucks and other rolling stock under operating leases due to lower long term interest rates and our inability to recover the associated tax benefits in those years 
in  we expect to purchase a greater percentage of this equipment  primarily as a result of our ability to recover the associated tax benefits 
our management believes  on the basis of current expectations  that our cash on hand  internally generated cash flow and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to provide the liquidity necessary to fund our operations and meet our planned capital expenditure and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
cash flow our consolidated cash flows for each of the past three years are presented below in thousands year ended december operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities our net cash provided by operating activities generally reflects the cash effects of transactions and other events used in the determination of net income or loss 
net cash provided by operating activities of million in the year ended december  increased million from the net cash provided in the year ended december  this increase is principally a result of higher operating income  higher income tax refunds and proceeds from the early termination of the interest rate swap agreements  partially offset by higher interest payments 
net cash provided by operating activities of million in the year ended december  increased million from the net cash provided in the year ended december  this increase reflected the receipt of approximately million in cash collateral previously used for our insurance retention programs  lower interest payments in and the timing of accounts payable payments at december   partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory at december   as compared to the end of the prior year 
net cash used by investing activities of million in the year ended december  increased million from the net cash used in the year ended december   primarily because of acquisitions we made in capital expenditures increased by million during the year ended december  our net cash used for investing activities of million in the year ended december  decreased million from the net cash used in the year ended december   primarily because of an acquisition we made in capital expenditures decreased by million during the year ended december   with this decrease offset by asset disposition activities 
our net cash provided from financing activities of million in the year ended december  decreased million from the net cash used in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to our march refinancing activities  partially offset by the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and shares sold to employees under our employee stock purchase plan during the year ended december  as a result of these activities  cash and cash equivalents  which totaled million at december   decreased million from december  our net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  increased million from the net cash used in the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to our march refinancing activities  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and shares sold to employees under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by repurchases of shares during the year ended december  we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of properties  plant and equipment net of disposals 
free cash flow is a liquidity measure not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our management uses free cash flow in managing our business because we consider it to be an important indicator of our ability to service our debt and generate cash for acquisitions and other strategic investments 
we believe free cash flow may provide users of our financial information additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods 
as a non gaap financial measure  free cash flow should be viewed in addition to  and not as an alternative for  our reported operating results or cash flow from operations or any other measure of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
our historical net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow is as follows in thousands year ended december net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of properties and equipment  net of disposals of   and  free cash flow acquisitions in december  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of go crete and south loop development corporation  which produce and deliver ready mixed concrete from six plants and mine sand and gravel from a quarry in the greater dallas fort worth  texas market 
we purchased the assets for approximately million in cash and assumed certain capital lease liabilities with a net present value of about million 
in november  we acquired substantially all the operating assets  including real property  of city concrete company  city concrete products  inc and city transports  inc  which produce and deliver ready mixed concrete from five plants in the greater memphis  tennessee and northern mississippi area  for approximately million in cash 
in january  we acquired a small ready mixed concrete operation in knoxville  tennessee 
the purchase price was approximately million in cash 
in december  we acquired riefkohl contracting llc  which provides precast concrete installation services in the greater phoenix  arizona market 
the purchase price was approximately million  comprised of million in cash  and  shares of our common stock valued at million in february  we acquired builders redi mix  inc  which produces and distributes ready mixed concrete in the greater lansing  michigan market 
the purchase price was approximately million  comprised of million in cash  net of cash acquired  and  shares of our common stock valued at million 
since our inception  cash has been the primary component in the consideration we have paid to acquire businesses 
we expect that cash will be a significant  if not the principal  element in acquisitions we might make in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
from time to time we may enter into noncancelable operating leases that would not be reflected on our balance sheet 
for additional discussion on our operating leases  see note to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
commitments the following are our contractual commitments associated with our indebtedness and our lease obligations as of december  in millions 
contractual obligations total less than year years years after years principal on debt interest on debt capital leases operating leases total interest payments due under our senior subordinated notes 
represents cash payments required 
these obligations are recorded on our balance sheet at net present value at december  the following are our commercial commitment expirations as of december  in millions other commercial commitments total less than year years years after years standby letters of credit purchase obligations performance bonds total other we periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our dividend policy  our debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  in the past we have sought  and in the future we may seek  to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of our common stock  modify our dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of our business  we may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the ready mixed concrete or related businesses 
in the event of any acquisition or joint venture transaction  we may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing our indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing our existing debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
inflation as a result of the relatively low levels of inflation during the past three years  inflation did not significantly affect our results of operations in any of those years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  but we utilize them to manage our fixed to variable rate debt ratio 
all derivatives  whether designated as hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
because of the short duration of our investments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their fair values 
the indebtedness evidenced by our senior subordinated notes is fixed rate debt  so we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
the fair value of that debt will vary as interest rates change 
effective april   we entered into interest rate swap agreements that had the economic effect of modifying the interest obligations associated with million of our senior subordinated notes  such that the interest payable on these senior subordinated notes effectively was to become variable based on the six month libor rate  set on april and october of each year 
we terminated these interest rate swap agreements in june the swaps had been designated as fair value hedges and had no ineffective portion 
the notional amounts of the swaps matched the principal amounts of the hedged portion of the senior subordinated notes  and the termination dates of the swaps matched the maturity date of the notes 
as a result of the swaps  the interest rate on the hedged portion of the notes was libor plus 
because the swap agreements were considered an effective fair value hedge  there was no effect on our results of operations from the mark to market adjustment while the swap agreements were in effect 
the swap agreements were marked to market each quarter  with a corresponding mark to market adjustment reflected as either a discount or premium on the senior subordinated notes 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was million and included in other assets 
during the year ended december   the interest rate swap agreements reduced our interest expense by approximately million million  net of tax 
we purchase commodities  such as cement  aggregates and diesel fuel  at market prices and do not currently use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
our operations are subject to factors affecting the level of general construction activity  including the level of interest rates and availability of funds for construction 
a significant decrease in the level of general construction activity in any of our market areas may have a material adverse effect on our sales and earnings
