overview introgen therapeutics  inc was incorporated in delaware in we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
we are developing product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers using tumor suppressors  cytokines and other targeted molecular therapies 
these agents are designed to increase production of normal cancer fighting proteins that act to overpower cancerous cells  stimulate immune activity and enhance conventional cancer therapies 
see item business overview above for a more complete discussion of our business 
since our inception in  we have used our resources primarily to conduct research and development activities for advexin therapy and  to a lesser extent  for other product candidates

acquisition of magnum therapeutics corporation in october  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of magnum  a company owned at the time of this acquisition by one of our executive officers 
we paid approximately million for the magnum stock by issuing approximately  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million at the acquisition date and assuming liabilities of approximately  with respect to the common stock we issued pursuant to the acquisition  of the shares were held by an independent escrow agent for a period of approximately one year subsequent to the acquisition date to satisfy the indemnification obligations of the selling shareholder under terms of the purchase agreement 
such shares have since been released from escrow 
magnum s primary asset is the funding it receives under a research grant from the nih  which supplements our ongoing research and development programs 
during the years ended december  and  we earned revenue of million and million  respectively  under this grant 
in the event certain of magnum s technologies result in commercial products  we may be obligated to pay royalties related to the sales of those products to certain third parties 
the results of magnum s operations have been included with ours for the period subsequent to the october acquisition date 
since magnum was a development stage company at the time we acquired it  this acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition and not a business combination 
the total purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of the net assets acquired is as follows in thousands cash and cash equivalents acquired grant rights conversion of preferred stock to common stock in june  the  issued and outstanding shares of our series a non voting convertible preferred stock held by aventis were converted into  shares of our common stock 
the shares of preferred stock were cancelled and replaced by newly issued shares of our common stock 
the preferred shares cancelled are no longer issuable 
we received no cash or other consideration in connection with this conversion 
under a voting agreement related to these shares  aventis must vote these shares in the same manner as the shares voted by a majority of the other stockholders on any corporate action put to a vote of our stockholders 
this voting requirement terminates at the earliest of june or the sale of these shares pursuant to an effective registration statement  on the open market or to an aventis non affiliate  as defined in the voting agreement 
pursuant to a demand registration made by aventis in accordance with the terms of a registration rights agreement related to these shares  in november we filed a registration statement on form s file no 
registering for sale a total of  shares held by aventis  which includes the converted shares 
after this conversion  we have million shares of authorized and unissued preferred shares  of which  shares have been cancelled and million shares are undesignated and issuable 

table of contents investment in sr pharma plc in july  we purchased approximately of the issued share capital of sr pharma for approximately million 
as of december   the shares we purchased had a fair market value of million 
sr pharma is a european biotechnology company publicly traded on the alternative investment market of the lse that is developing oncology and other products 
london stock exchange we are evaluating the feasibility of listing our common stock on the lse  which would be in addition to the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market system in the united states 
we believe an lse listing may allow us to better leverage our assets on a global basis and  specifically  in europe and asia 
research grants we have a grant from the national cancer institute to support our phase clinical trial of ingn in patients with metastatic melanoma 
we received grant funding and earned grant revenue under this grant of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
magnum  our wholly owned subsidiary  has a grant from the nih for the development of complementary adenoviral vectors for the treatment of cancer 
magnum received grant funding and earned grant revenue under this grant of zero  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the amount of grant funding  if any  available to us to perform research and development is dependent upon many factors  including the availability of grants from government agencies  our performing the work and incurring the costs contemplated by the grants we currently have  our success in obtaining additional grants in the future and our compliance with statutes and regulations governing such grants 
critical accounting policies use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments include investments in short term  investment grade securities  which currently consist primarily of united states federal government obligations 
these investments are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
at any point in time  amortized costs may be greater or less than fair value 
if investments are sold prior to maturity  we could incur a realized gain or loss based on the fair market value of the investments at the date of sale 
we could incur future losses on investments if the investment issuer becomes impaired or the investment is downgraded 
marketable securities 
our marketable securities consist of issued share capital of other public companies and are classified as available for sale 
unrealized gains and losses are computed using the published share price of the applicable stock exchange at the close of business on the last day of the reporting period and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity until realized 
intangible assets 
grant rights acquired  which are presented as an intangible asset on our balance sheet  resulted from our asset acquisition related to the magnum purchase in october we amortize that asset to expense on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining life of that asset 
we review purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future 
table of contents undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
revenue recognition 
contract services revenue is recognized when the related services are completed and delivered to the customer 
deferred revenue is recorded for cash received for which the related expense had not been incurred 
grant revenue is recognized as research expense relating to a grant is incurred and the work contemplated under the grant has been performed 
rental income from the sublease of laboratory space to third parties under leases that have variable monthly rent amounts over the term of the lease is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
any cash payments received in excess of rental income recognized is recorded as deferred revenue 
rental income is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
research and development costs 
in conducting our clinical trials of advexin therapy and other product candidates  we procure services from numerous third party vendors 
the cost of these services constitutes a significant portion of the cost of these trials and of our research and development expense in general 
these vendors do not necessarily provide us billings for their services on a regular basis and  accordingly  are often not a timely source of information to determine the costs we have incurred relative to their services for any given accounting period 
as a result  we make significant accounting estimates as to the amount of costs we have incurred relative to these vendors in each accounting period 
these estimates are based on numerous factors  including  among others  costs set forth in our contracts with these vendors  the period of time over which the vendor will render the services and the rate of enrollment of patients in our clinical trials 
using these estimates  we record expenses and accrued liabilities in each accounting period that we believe fairly represent our obligations to these vendors 
actual results could differ from these estimates  resulting in increases or decreases in the amount of expense recorded and the related accrual 
we have consistently applied these estimation procedures in the past and plan to continue applying such procedures in the same manner during the foreseeable future 
our experience has been that our estimates have reasonably reflected the expense we actually incur 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  sfas no 
r  share based payment  was issued 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity investments for goods and services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payments with parties other than employees 
the statement requires measurement of the cost of employee service received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  with limited exceptions 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period of the award 
a public entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of a liability instrument based on the instrument s current fair value 
the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation over that period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of these instruments 
we will be required to comply with sfas no 
r for the annual reporting period beginning january  we have not yet determined which fair value method and transitional provision we will follow 
we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we do not expect such adoption to significantly impact our financial position or liquidity 
see share based compensation in note to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma impact on net loss and net loss per share from calculating share based compensation costs under the fair value alternative of sfas no 
the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of 
table of contents sfas no 
r may be different from the calculation of compensation cost under sfas no 
 but such differences have not yet been quantified 
results of operations our operations consist primarily of the research and development of our product candidates and technologies described in item business product development programs above 
our research and development expense includes  but is not limited to  expense related to personnel  facilities and equipment  pre clinical research  clinical trials  manufacturing of materials for use in clinical trials  conducting data analysis and conducting regulatory documentation submissions to the fda 
our research and development expense can be divided between programs in the pre clinical stage and programs in the clinical stage  and general research and development expense attributable to all programs 
we manage our business by tracking research and development expense in these categories in lieu of tracking research and development expense on a project by project basis 
tables setting forth the amount of research and development expense we have incurred in each of these categories are presented below under comparison of the years ended december  and december  and comparison of the years ended december  and december  to commercialize our product candidates  we must obtain certain regulatory approvals 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically takes many years and involves compliance with requirements covering pre clinical research  clinical trials  manufacturing  quality control  labeling and promotion of drugs for human use 
to obtain regulatory approvals  we must  among other requirements  complete clinical trials and other work demonstrating our product candidates are safe and effective for a particular cancer type or other disease 
the fda and other similar agencies throughout the world have substantial discretion over the work we must perform to obtain regulatory approval 
the likelihood that a product candidate will be commercially successful may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
because of the discretion of the fda and similar agencies throughout the world  as well as the foregoing factors  we cannot predict with reasonable accuracy the future expense we will incur developing these product candidates  when we will complete our work in developing these product candidates or when  if ever  we will earn significant revenue from approved products that might result from these product development programs 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see item a 
risk factors  and particularly the risk factors entitled if we are unable to commercialize advexin therapy in various markets for multiple indications  particularly for the treatment of head and neck cancer  our business will be harmed  if we fail to comply with fda requirements or encounter delays or difficulties in clinical trials for our product candidates  we may not obtain regulatory approval of some or all of our product candidates on a timely basis  if at all  even if our products are approved by regulatory authorities  if we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements  or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products  these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market  failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs could prevent us from selling our products in foreign markets  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial conditions  if we continue to incur operating losses for a period longer than we anticipate and fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to advance our development program and complete our clinical trials  
table of contents if we cannot maintain our existing corporate and academic arrangements and enter into new arrangements  we may be unable to develop products effectively  or at all  if we are not able to create effective collaborative marketing relationships  we may be unable to market advexin therapy successfully or in a cost effective manner  and even if we receive regulatory approval to market our advexin therapy  ingn  ingn or other product candidates  we may not be able to commercialize them profitably

total contract services  grant and other revenue was million for the period compared to million for the period  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to increased contract services revenue from third parties under agreements to provide manufacturing process development and product production services for them partially offset by a decrease in revenue earned from research grants from us government agencies

research and development expense consisted of the following in thousands year ended december  pre clinical stage programs expense clinical stage programs expense general research and development expense total research and development expense research and development expense included share based payments expense of  in the period and  in the period 
the increase in research and development expense in the period compared to the period was a result of increased amortization related to the amortization of grant rights acquired in the purchase of magnum  increased share based compensation expense for the reasons discussed below under share based compensation expense  increased manufacturing and process development costs in the period compared to the period resulting from ongoing development of production processes for our product candidates and increased manufacturing process development and product production services for third parties 
these increases were offset by lower costs in the period compared to the period related to the preparation of the bla for advexin therapy for filing with the fda since significant portions of that initial work were completed in general and administrative 
general and administrative expense was million for the period compared to million for the period 
this expense included share based compensation expense of 
table of contents  in the period and  in the period 
this increase in general and administrative expense was due to higher share based compensation expense  which increased for the reasons discussed below under share based compensation expense  increased consulting and professional fees related to the pursuit of foreign capital offset by decreased costs related to securities offerings not pursued to completion in the period that were not repeated in the period 
share based compensation expense 
share based compensation expense was million for the period compared to  for the period 
the increase in this expense was primarily due to the grant of shares of our common stock to certain of our officers in the period as a result of the expiration of certain of their stock options during that period and for which there was no similar transaction during the period 
during the period  options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock held by certain of our officers reached the end of their stated contractual ten year life  resulting in the expiration of the right to exercise those options 
to provide those officers with an economic equivalent to those expired options  we granted them an aggregate of  shares of our common stock during the period  of which  shares were issued to those officers and  shares were withheld by us in consideration for our payment on their behalf of approximately  of federal income taxes 
we recorded compensation expense of approximately million in connection with these share issuances 
our insider trading policy restricts sales of our common stock by our officers and employees 
accordingly  the expiring options described above could not be exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise program prior to their respective expiration dates due to these insider trading restrictions

this expense included share based payments expense of  for the period and  for the period

this increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to increased activity related to the preparation of the bla for advexin therapy for filing with the fda  which resulted in us hiring more employees and engaging additional consultants to perform this work 
also  in the period  we expensed  of costs incurred with respect to certain securities offering activities for the sale of our common stock during the first two quarters of that did not result in a closing of a sale of common stock 
share based compensation expense 
share based compensation expense was  for the period and million for the period 
this compensation for the period arose primarily as a result of stock options granted to certain members of our board of directors for which some of the options were fully vested upon issuance and had exercise prices below the market value of our common stock at the date of grant  which resulted in compensation expense  stock options  which were fully vested upon issuance  issued to our corporate secretary  who is not a director or employee and for whom option grants result in compensation charges under fair value accounting  and amortization of deferred compensation remaining from stock options granted in earlier periods 
this compensation expense decreased for the period because the options granted to members of our board of directors during the period had exercise prices equal to the market value of our common stock at the date of grant  resulting in no compensation expense  
table of contents the options granted to our corporate secretary during the period vest over multiple periods  resulting in recognition of some of the compensation expense arising from those options being deferred to future periods  and deferred compensation related to previously granted stock options became fully amortized in previous periods

liquidity and capital resources in the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources  references to the period refer to the year ended december  and references to the period refer to the year ended december  we have incurred annual operating losses since our inception 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
from inception through december   we have financed our operations primarily from the following sources million of collaborative research and development payments from aventis  million of equity sales in december and december through registered direct offerings under a shelf registration filed with the commission  million of private equity sales to aventis  million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in october  million of private equity sales  net of offering costs  to others including million from the private sale of our common stock in june million of equity sales  net of offering costs  to colgate palmolive pursuant to an alliance agreement entered into in november million from contract services  grants  interest and other income  million in mortgage financing from banks for our facilities  million of sales of advexin therapy product to aventis for use in later stage clinical trials  and million in leases and notes payable from commercial lessors and lenders to acquire equipment pledged as collateral for those leases and notes 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents constituted million and 
table of contents million of these amounts at december   and december   respectively 
this decrease in cash and cash equivalents at december   as compared to december  was due to activity during the year ended december   that included million used in operating activities   used by investing activities and million provided by financing activities 
we expect to continue to focus our activities primarily on conducting phase and other clinical trials  conducting data analysis related to those trials  preparing regulatory documentation submissions to the fda  producing advexin therapy and other clinical materials for use in our clinical trials and conducting pre marketing activities for advexin therapy 
we expect to continue our research and development of various other targeted molecular therapy technologies 
if advexin therapy or any of our other product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the fda  we expect to conduct activities supporting the marketing  sales  production and distribution of those products  either ourselves or in collaboration with other parties 
the majority of our expenditures for the foreseeable future will most likely be for these activities as they relate to advexin therapy 
these activities may increase the rate at which we use cash in the future as compared to the cash we used for operating activities during the year ended december  we believe our existing working capital can fund our operations for the next to months  although we may have to make adjustments to the scope of operations to achieve that objective  and unforeseen events could shorten that time period 
our existing resources may not be sufficient to support the commercial introduction of any of our product candidates 
in order to fund our operating losses  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not know whether such additional financing will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the period compared to million for the period 
this increase was due to a larger net loss in the period compared to the period  and an aggregate decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the period compared to an aggregate increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the period due to variations in the timing of payments to vendors that is a function of the nature of vendors to whom we have obligations and variations in the terms of payment to them  with the above items offset by depreciation that increased in the period compared to the period due to acquisitions of property and equipment during and subsequent to the period for which the first full year of depreciation was the period  share based compensation expense that increased in the period compared to the period due to the issuance of shares to certain officers in connection with expiring stock options as discussed above under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of the year ended december  and december  share based compensation expense  an increase in amortization of grant rights acquired during the period compared to the period since such amortization was recorded throughout but for only a portion of because the rights being amortized arose in connection with our acquisition of magnum in october a decrease in other assets during the period compared to an increase in other assets during the period due to a prepayment of certain expenses in the period that did not occur in the period and a decrease in federal grant funding receivable during the period compared to an increase in federal grant funding receivable during the period due to the receipt in the period of grant funding earned during that period whereas grant funding earned during the period was received in subsequent periods  and 
table of contents an increase in deferred revenue during the period that was greater than the increase during the period due to an increase in payments from third parties in advance of us performing work under agreements to provide manufacturing process development services for them 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the period compared to million for the period 
this decrease was primarily due to a lower level of equipment purchases in the period compared to the period and a lower level of net activity in purchases and maturities of short term investments in the period compared to the period due to normal variations in the amount and timing of purchases and sales of short term investments based on our operating needs for cash and cash equivalents and the availability of cash from sales of our common stock 
these decreases were offset by our purchase of marketable securities during the period through our investment in sr pharma as discussed above under item business overview investment in sr pharma plc 
we have no obligations at this time to purchase significant amounts of additional property or equipment  but our needs may change 
it may be necessary for us to purchase larger amounts of property and equipment to support our clinical programs and other research  development and manufacturing activities 
we may need to obtain debt or lease financing to facilitate such purchases

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our fixed rate long term debt and short term investments in investment grade securities  which consist primarily of federal government obligations 
investments are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in the interest rates of our investments at the investment balances as of december  would decrease our interest income by approximately at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt approximated its carrying value based upon discounted future cash flows using current market prices 
equity price risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk from time to time  we may invest in marketable securities of public companies  typically in the form of equity instruments  for business and strategic purposes

we are exposed to market risk for changes in equity prices and foreign currency translation adjustments as a result of our investments in marketable securities 
these marketable securities are subject to significant fluctuation in fair value due to the volatility of the industry in which sr pharma participates and changes in the relative foreign currency values 
we do not hedge our equity price risk or foreign currency translation exposure or invest in derivative securities
