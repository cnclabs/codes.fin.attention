item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of our results from through our results have benefited from management s focus on the core of our business  uhp water pumps and the applications that integrate these pumps to cut and clean material 
improved global awareness of the benefits of waterjet cutting and cleaning technology over other traditional methods has resulted in increased global adoption of waterjet cutting and cleaning technology across multiple industries 
our investment in sales and marketing has been a key factor in the improved global awareness 
additionally  our investment in research and engineering has allowed us to continue to introduce new waterjet applications and product enhancements  expanding the market for waterjet technology 
sales were million in  million in  and million in our combined sales for north america  asia and other international waterjet which were of sales in  in and in  benefited from the increased global adoption of waterjet technology 
overall sales growth was negatively impacted by a decline in sales of our applications segment which were of sales in  in  and in beginning in  we started repositioning this business to focus on integrating waterjet cutting cells into engineered robotic systems and reduce the focus on non waterjet applications 
we believe the applications segment is now positioned for growth in the future 
operating income loss was million or of sales in  million or of sales in  and million or of sales in operating results have benefited from improvements in our manufacturing processes  cost reductions from our global supply chain initiatives and the benefits of increased volume 
we maintained our focus on controlling costs but experienced a large increase in general

general and administrative expenses were of sales in  in and in income loss from continuing operations was million or per diluted share on million average shares in  million or per diluted share on million average shares in  and million or per diluted share on million average shares in the increase in average shares in was mainly due to the issuance of common stock in connection with our pipe transaction in march the increase in average shares in was mainly due to the common stock issued in being outstanding for the full year 
in addition to improvements in operating income  income from continuing operations in has benefited from a reduction in interest expense from lower debt levels 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in and million in income from continuing operations in was also significantly impacted by the non cash expense related to the revaluation of the warrants issued in the pipe transaction of million 
the s for the resale of shares and shares issuable on the exercise of warrants issued in the pipe was declared effective on february   at which time the warrants no longer were required to be revalued and were reclassified to capital in excess of par 
the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  described below in discontinued operations  was million or per diluted share in  million or per diluted share in  and million or per diluted share in net income loss was million or per diluted share in  million or per diluted share in  and million or per diluted share in over the past three years  we have improved our overall liquidity position and strengthened our balance sheet 
from through  we reduced our net outstanding debt by million from increased cash generated through improved operations  divesting non core subsidiaries and the issuance of common shares in connection with the pipe transaction in march as of april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and total net outstanding debt of million 
in july  we entered into a million  three year domestic senior credit agreement 
as of april   we had million of domestic unused line of credit  net of million in outstanding letters of credit 
on october   consistent with our strategy to divest operations that are not part of our core uhp water pump business  we sold our general press operations and the non uhp portion of our food reportable segment the avure disposition 
included in the avure disposition were our avure technologies  incorporated  flow international fps ab  avure technologies ab subsidiaries  and our interest in flow autoclave systems together  the avure business 
as a result  the avure business has been presented as discontinued operations in the financial statements for all historical financial periods presented 
fiscal compared to fiscal tabular amount in thousands sales 
our sales by segment for the periods noted below are summarized as follows difference sales north america waterjet asia waterjet other international waterjet applications total 
table of contents the north america  asia and other international waterjet segments primarily represent sales of our standard cutting and cleaning systems throughout the world  as well as sales of complex aerospace systems designed and manufactured to buyers specifications  which are accounted for on the percentage of completion method and represent of revenues 
for the fiscal year ended april   revenue from our three waterjet segments increased million  or  to million versus the prior year comparative period 
the majority of the increase was recognized in our north america and asia segments 
our revenue in north america was bolstered by strong shapecutting system sales in the us as we continue to increase the market awareness of waterjet technology through investments in marketing and tradeshow activity 
our waterjets are experiencing growing acceptance in the marketplace because of their flexibility and superior machine performance 
we also continue to invest in direct sales and technical services staff adding new personnel to service potential and existing customers 
there were no significant price increases year over year  other than a price increase of on selected systems which was instituted on february  sales of large aerospace systems were million for the year ended april   up million from the prior year same period from work completed on contracts awarded in fiscal and we expect continued growth in sales to the aerospace industry in our fiscal year at the end of fiscal  we announced the introduction of the stonecrafter tm  a system specifically designed for the stone and tile industry  and a new  psi pump which increases the cutting speed over the  psi currently in use 
we expect new product development and enhancements such as these  and the increasing adoption of waterjet cutting  to drive sales growth over the next few years 
our asian waterjet revenue rose million to over million for the year ended april  this increase was fueled by expansion of waterjet systems into the semiconductor industry and continued economic expansion of the chinese economy thus driving demand for machine tools 
there were no significant price increases year over year 
in november  we introduced the nanojet tm system that is used by the semiconductor industry to cut flash memory chips 
we believe that sales from the nanojet tm system and increased adoption of waterjet cutting in asia should allow us to continue to increase sales 
growth in the other international waterjet segment represents primarily sales into europe and south america 
european waterjet revenues experienced a increase to nearly million for fiscal on strong demand for our shapecutting systems driven by our continued penetration in the waterjet cutting market 
we expect continued growth in western and central europe from additional investments in sales and marketing 
sales into south america increased million to million on higher standard shapecutting system sales as we focused our efforts in this area 
our applications segment represents sales of our automation and robotic waterjet cutting cells  as well as non waterjet systems  which are sold primarily into the north american automotive industry 
for the fiscal year ended april   we reported a million  or  decrease in revenue to million versus the prior year comparative period 
this decline resulted from softness in the domestic automotive industry as well as from the closing and relocation of our wixom  michigan facility to our burlington  ontario facility 
this shutdown was completed to combine like businesses and reduce operating costs 
in addition  we have been increasing our sales focus on systems that integrate waterjet cutting cells and deemphasizing non waterjet systems 
although these steps have reduced revenue in the short term we believe the business is now better positioned for long term growth 
systems vs 
spares 
we also analyze our consolidated revenues by looking at system sales and consumable sales 
systems sales were million  up million or  for the year ended april  on strong domestic shapecutting sales as well as increased sales of large aerospace systems  as discussed in the section above 
consumables revenues recorded an increase of million or to million for the year ended april  increases in spares sales for fiscal resulted from a growing number of systems in service  our proprietary productivity enhancing kits and improved parts availability as well as the use of flowparts 
com  our easy to use internet order entry system currently deployed in the us 
we will be launching 
table of contents flowparts 
com in europe at the end of our first fiscal quarter 
on august   we sold our garnet distribution business  consisting of a customer list  which negatively impacted the growth of spares revenues in domestic garnet distribution business previously accounted for approximately million of our annual spares sales 
partially offsetting this reduction in garnet revenues were the revenues received from continuing royalties 
we believe that spare parts sales should continue to increase as more systems are put into service and as customers make greater use of their systems 
cost of sales and gross margins 
our gross margin by segment for the periods noted below is summarized as follows difference gross margin north america waterjet asia waterjet other international waterjet applications total our gross margin as a percent of sales by segment for the periods noted below is summarized as follows gross margin percentage north america waterjet asia waterjet other international waterjet applications total gross margin for the year ended april  amounted to million or of sales as compared to gross margin of million or of sales in the prior year 
overall  the gross margin improvements are attributable to cost reductions from our global supply chain initiatives as well as improved cost absorption from higher sales volumes in standard shapecutting and aerospace system sales mainly in our north america market  and strong product pricing and improved product mix in our asia market 
our applications segment recorded significant increases in margins due to better cost control and improved contract selection criteria 
fiscal applications segment margins included significant costs accrued on several loss contracts which totaled million 
generally across all segments  comparison of gross margin rates will vary period over period depending on the mix of sales  which includes special system  standard system and consumables sales 
gross margin rates on our systems sales are typically less than as compared to consumables sales which are generally in excess of 
in addition  gross margin as a percent of sales will vary amongst segments due to inter company sales and the related inter company transfer pricing 
marketing expenses 
our marketing expenses by segment for the periods noted below are summarized as follows difference marketing north america waterjet asia waterjet other international waterjet applications total 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses increased million or for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year 
this expense growth in the north america  asia and other international segment stemmed from higher commissions driven by increased sales  additional headcount  as well as increased marketing and advertising costs directed at building waterjet technology awareness 
the applications segment decreased its expenses as the wixom division was closed in q and all marketing activity is currently consolidated and handled through our burlington  ontario facility 
expressed as a percentage of sales  consolidated marketing expenses were for fiscal  compared to of sales for fiscal research and engineering expenses 
our research and engineering expenses by segment for the periods noted below are summarized as follows difference research and engineering north america waterjet asia waterjet other international waterjet applications total research and engineering expenses increased million or for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year 
in north america  we added key engineering personnel related to our core uhp technology as well as additional engineering resources to support new core product development  such as stonecrafter  the  psi pump and the  psi husky as well as continued core product enhancements such as flowmaster 
these new products were introduced later in fiscal and their introduction is not expected to impact revenue until fiscal in asia  we added resources to support new product development  such as the nanojet tm system 
expressed as a percentage of revenue  research and engineering expenses were in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses by segment for the periods noted below are summarized as follows difference general and administrative north america waterjet asia waterjet other international waterjet applications total general and administrative expenses increased million or for the year ended april   as compared to the prior year from higher corporate overhead costs 
these costs stemmed from incremental professional and consulting costs of million related to sarbanes oxley compliance  audit fees and legal expenses related to patent litigation and corporate transactions and filings 
in addition  we expensed a total of million during the year ended april  related to key executive retention programs  including  from the acceleration of awards under these plans which were terminated in february expressed as a percentage of revenue  consolidated general and administrative expenses were in fiscal as compared to for the prior year period 
restructuring charges 
we incurred million of severance benefits and lease restructuring costs in the applications segment related to the closing and relocation of our wixom  michigan facility during the year ended april  
table of contents financial consulting charges 
no financial consulting costs were incurred in the year ended april  as compared with the  charge in the prior year period associated with our efforts to refinance our subordinated debt 
these costs were either expenses related to potential senior credit arrangements with lenders that did not occur  or they related to expenses associated with our subordinated debt and did not result in an increase in the facility  accordingly  they were expensed 
gain on barton sale 
we entered into a purchase agreement the purchase agreement with barton mines company barton on august  to sell barton our customer list for million which was recorded in operating expenses in the year ended april  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
operating income loss 
our operating income loss by segment for the periods noted below is summarized as follows difference operating income loss north america waterjet asia waterjet other international waterjet   nm applications nm total nm not meaningful our operating income for the year ended april  was million versus million in the prior year 
the reasons for the changes in operating profit by segment have been described in the paragraphs above addressing changes in sales  gross margin and operating expenses 
fair value adjustment on warrants issued 
during the year ended april  and  we incurred million and  expense  respectively  associated with the warrants issued in our pipe transaction  described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the terms of these warrants required them to be marked to market at each reporting period until the associated form s was declared effective with corresponding gains and losses reported on the consolidated statement of operations 
the form s was declared effective on february   as such  the warrants no longer were required to be marked to market 
interest and other income expense 
interest expense amounted to million for the year ended april  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
interest income amounted to  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
 of the  interest income related to the million promissory note we received for the sale of the avure business  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this reduction in interest expense results from lower average debt and the pay off of our subordinated debt in april coupled with lower interest rates charged on outstanding debt 
fiscal interest expense included million related to the write off of the debt discount associated with the pay off of our subordinated debt and the write off of related deferred loan costs as well as the expensing of anti dilution warrants provided to the subordinated debt lenders 
the following table shows the detail of other income  net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations net realized foreign exchange gain net unrealized foreign exchange gain loss other total 
table of contents we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  the eurodollar  the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  and the swiss franc 
as all of our foreign operations have functional currencies in other than the us dollar  we translate the assets and liabilities of these operations into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
see item a for discussion of our foreign exchange risks 
in fiscal  the euro weakened relative to the dollar and we recorded realized foreign exchange losses on the settlement of intercompany transactions with our european division 
these losses were combined with losses realized on settlement with our canadian division as the us dollar weakened relative to the canadian dollar in fiscal these losses were offset by a gain realized on a capital contribution from our swiss subsidiary 
net unrealized foreign exchange gain for fiscal stemmed from translating the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations which were denominated in currencies other than the division s functional currency 
the weaker dollar in fiscal positively impacted our other income and we realized net currency gains on settlement of intercompany transactions  specifically with our european division 
as the us dollar remained weak as of the end of fiscal vis vis the euro and the new taiwanese dollar  this also caused changes in our balance sheet  particularly pertaining to our intercompany accounts  and led to the recording of net unrealized foreign exchange losses 
income taxes 
in fiscal  the foreign tax provision consists of current and deferred tax expense in taiwan  japan  and current expense in brazil and argentina 
the us tax provision consists primarily of state taxes and accrued foreign withholding taxes 
we are no longer permanently deferring undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
we recorded a million liability for withholding taxes payable on future repatriation of foreign earnings in fiscal during fiscal  we repatriated million from a foreign subsidiary and plan to continue to repatriate additional earnings in the future 
the fiscal tax provision consisted of current and deferred expense related to operations in foreign jurisdictions which are profitable  primarily in taiwan and japan 
in addition  operations in certain jurisdictions principally germany and the united states reported net operating losses for which no tax benefit was recognized as it is more likely than not that such benefit will not be realized 
we continue to assess our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets 
recognizing the continued losses generated during fiscal and in prior periods  we have determined it appropriate to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our domestic net operating losses  certain foreign net operating losses and certain other deferred tax assets based on the expected reversal of both deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the domestic net operating losses can be carried forward years to offset domestic profits in future periods and expire between fiscal and fiscal if not used 
our foreign net operating losses currently do not have an expiration date 
we provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets associated with the losses recorded during fiscal discontinued operations  net of tax 
in october  we sold our avure business and have recast our financial statements to reflect the avure business as discontinued operations for all historical periods presented 
for the year ended april   income from operations of discontinued operations was  we recorded a loss of million  net of income tax of  on the sale which was consummated on october  net income loss

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal tabular amount in thousands sales 
our sales by segment for the periods noted below is summarized as follows difference sales north america waterjet asia waterjet other international waterjet applications total the north america  asia and other international waterjet segments primarily represent sales of our standard cutting and cleaning systems throughout the world  as well as sales of complex aerospace systems designed and manufactured to buyers specifications 
the applications segment represents sales of our automation and robotic waterjet cutting cells  as well as non waterjet systems  which are sold primarily into the north american automotive industry 
for the fiscal year ended april   we reported a million  or  increase in revenue to million versus the prior year comparative period 
all four segments reported an increase in revenue  however million of the million increase was recognized in our north america waterjet segment 
at the end of fiscal  we believed the market awareness of waterjet technology was low and addressed this through an increase in marketing and tradeshow activity  including attendance at the bi annual international manufacturing technology show in early september  as well as increasing the number of domestic waterjet cutting direct sales staff from to  adding two machine tool distributors  acting as agents  and increasing domestic technical services staff from to persons 
the growth in revenue in north america is a result of an increase in unit sales stemming from our increased sales and marketing activity 
there were no significant price increases year over year  however a price increase of on selected systems was implemented on february  aerospace sales  which are also included in the north america segment  were million  up million from the prior year 
the growth in our applications segment results from improved non waterjet automated robotic system demand in the domestic automotive industry 
we have not increased our marketing and sales staff in this segment year over year 
our waterjets experienced growing acceptance in the marketplace because of their flexibility and superior machine performance 
outside the us  waterjet revenue growth was positively influenced by growth in asia waterjet sales which were million  up million or for the year ended april  this increase was driven largely by sales in china where we experienced strong demand for shapecutting and cutting cell systems from a strengthening automotive industry 
our other international waterjet segment represents primarily sales in europe and south america 
revenues from our european operations have improved by million for the year ended april  to million 
market specific pricing including some price reductions  standardization of system offerings  improved delivery and a recovering european marketplace have helped to increase our european sales 
sales in south america of million for the year ended april  were comparable to the respective prior year period 
the economic conditions in the south america region make it difficult to increase sales 
we are typically able to sell our products at higher prices outside the us due to the costs of servicing these markets 
as much of our product is manufactured in the us  the weakness of the us dollar also has helped strengthen our foreign revenues

on average  standard systems which are included in the north america  asia and other international waterjet segments carry higher margins than the custom engineered systems  which are represented by the applications  segment 
in addition  gross margin as a percent of sales will vary amongst segments due to inter company sales and the related inter company transfer pricing 
the increase in north american waterjet margins were offset in part by the decrease of five percentage points in the applications segment in fiscal this weakness stems from a number of very low margin contracts built in fiscal  including several loss contracts which totaled million in losses 
all loss contracts were non waterjet related systems

at april   the net receivables balance decreased million or from april  the decrease in net receivables stemmed from the reduction in trade receivables of million or from million at april  to million at april  due to the sale of the avure business and collection of customer accounts 
receivables days sales outstanding including unbilled revenues and excluding the avure business for the comparative periods at april  increased to versus at april   commensurate with the increase in aerospace unbilled revenues at april  the overall decrease in trade receivables was offset by a slight increase in unbilled revenues from million at april  to million at april  the decrease due to the disposition of the avure business was offset by an increase in the percentage completion on our aerospace contracts as well as a higher number of automation contracts being worked on 
our unbilled receivables relate to equipment and systems sales accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
unbilled revenues fluctuate due to the scheduling of production and achievement of certain billing milestones 
in general  receivables can be negatively affected by the traditionally longer payment cycle outside the united states and the timing of billings and payments on large special system orders 
we do not believe these timing issues will present a material adverse impact on our short term liquidity requirements 
because of the lead time to build and deliver such equipment  ultimate collection of such accounts can be subject to changing customer business and economic conditions 
inventories at april  decreased million or from april  driven by the sale of the avure business 
this was offset by an increase of million in waterjet inventory in asia  europe and the us related to equipment for our aerospace contracts 
customer deposits were million at april   versus the million balance at april  the decrease due to the disposition of the avure business was offset by the receipt of milestone advances of million due under the significant aerospace contracts which we were awarded in fiscal and liquidity and capital resources at april   we had total cash of million  of which approximately million was held by divisions outside the united states

in fiscal and  our investments in capital equipment were minimal as we were trying to conserve cash and were restricted by our debt agreements on the amount of capital spending we were allowed 
our capital spending for fiscal and amounted to million and million  respectively 
we believe that our existing cash  cash from operations  and credit facilities at april  are adequate to fund our operations through april  tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations and other commercial commitments over various future periods as of april  see notes  and to april  consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding foreign currency contracts  long term debt  and lease obligations  respectively 
in thousands maturity by fiscal year thereafter total foreign currency contracts inventory purchases operating leases other long term debt  notes payable capital leases total as these obligations were entered into as hedges  the majority of these obligations will be offset by losses gains on the related assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
in late may  we received 
table of contents notification that the contract against which these hedges were put in place was being placed on hold 
we terminated these hedges in the first quarter of our fiscal we have included inventory purchase commitments  which are enforceable and legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities 
these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 
these commitments exclude open purchase orders 
these obligations include non inventory vendor commitments  such as professional retainers and trade show commitments 
this table is based on the contractual due dates of the long term debt  notes payable balances and capital leases 
total future payments of interest are and have been excluded from this table due to the insignificant amounts 
long term debt  notes payable and lease commitments are expected to be met from working capital provided by operations and  as necessary  by other borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financing or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
there are occasions whereupon we enter into forward contracts on foreign currencies  primarily the euro  purely for the purpose of hedging exposure to changes in the value of accounts receivable in those currencies against the us dollar 
at april   there was one euro forward contract outstanding with a notional amount of million which was subsequently settled in may critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these estimates and our accounting policies  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for uhp waterjet pumps and consumable and services sales  we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that revenue can only be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue generally is realized or realizable and earned when all four of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product sales revenue are generally recognized at the time of shipment  receipt by customer  or  if applicable  upon conversion of customer acceptance provisions 
because our flowmaster software is essential to the functionality of our uhp waterjet systems  we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the revenue recognition criteria of sop are similar to those of sab and software revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
for sales of systems  revenue is generally recognized when shipped 
revenue for installation services is recognized as services are provided 

table of contents for complex aerospace and automation systems designed and manufactured to buyers specification  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we use the cost to cost method  measuring the costs incurred on a project at a specified date  as compared to the estimated total cost of the project 
percentage of completion requires management to estimate costs to complete 
accordingly  modifications to estimates will impact percentage of completion revenues and associated gross margins 
valuation of obsolete excess inventory we currently record a valuation for obsolete or excess inventory for parts and equipment that are no longer used due to design changes to our products or lack of customer demand 
we regularly monitor our inventory levels and  if we identify an excess condition based on our usage and our financial policies  we record a corresponding valuation 
if our estimate for obsolete or excess inventory is understated  gross margins would be reduced 
valuation of deferred tax assets we review our deferred tax assets regularly to determine their realizability 
when evidence exists that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize a deferred tax asset dta  we set up a valuation allowance against the asset based on our estimate of the amount which will likely not be realizable 
future utilization of deferred tax assets could result in recording of income tax benefits 
the timing of any potential reversal of the valuation allowance is contingent on prior profitability and future expected profitability 
a large component of the dta relates to our net operating loss nol which will offset future taxable income 
as we become more profitable  the likelihood that the nol will be utilized also increases  which will increase the likelihood we will reverse the valuation allowance against the nol and other deferred tax assets 
the timing of these events is directly related to the timing and degree of our future profitability 
impairment of property and equipment  patents  other intangibles and goodwill we evaluate property and equipment  patents and other intangibles for potential impairment indicators when certain triggering events occur 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance  market conditions  legal factors and future plans 
if we conclude that a triggering event has occurred  we will compare the carrying values of the asset with the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from usage of the asset 
if there is a shortfall and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value  we will record an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value over fair value 
we estimate fair value by using a discounted cash flow model 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
many factors will ultimately influence the accuracy of these estimates 
we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for potential impairment indicators as of our fiscal year end and when certain triggering events occur 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on expected operational performance  market conditions  legal factors  and future plans 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill should be evaluated for impairment prior to our fiscal year end 
our impairment evaluation is based on comparing the fair value of the operating units  and if necessary  the implied fair value of goodwill  with corresponding carrying values 
any shortfalls would require us to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and implied value of goodwill 
we determine fair value by using a discounted cash flow model 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
expected future operational performance is based on estimates and management s judgment 
many factors will ultimately influence the accuracy of these estimates 

table of contents legal contingencies at any time  we may be involved in certain legal proceedings 
our policy is to routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience 
we record reserves related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be estimated 
with respect to other matters  management has concluded that a loss is only reasonably possible or remote and  therefore  no liability is recorded 
management discloses the facts regarding matters assessed as reasonably possible and potential exposure  if determinable 
costs incurred with defending claims are expensed as incurred 
as of april   we have accrued our estimate of the probable liabilities for the settlement of these claims 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exists in our financial instruments related to an increase in interest rates  adverse changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar  as well as financial risk management and derivatives 
these exposures are related to our daily operations 
interest rate exposure at april   we had million in interest bearing debt 
of this amount  million was fixed rate debt with an interest rate of per annum 
the remaining debt of million was at a variable interest rate from to as of april  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional contractual information on our debt obligations 
market risk is estimated as the potential for interest rates to increase on the variable rate debt 
a increase in interest rates would result in an approximate additional annual charge to our pre tax profits and cash flow of  based on the debt balance and interest rate as of april  at april   we had no derivative instruments to offset the risk of interest rate changes 
we may choose to use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage the risk associated with interest rate changes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar  the eurodollar  the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  and the swiss franc 
as all of our foreign operations have functional currencies in other than the us dollar  we translate the assets and liabilities of these operations into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
aggregate net foreign exchange gains included in the determination of net income amounted to  for the year ended april  based on the net position of foreign assets less liabilities  a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar in all currencies we operate could impact operating income by million and other income expense by  based on the fiscal operating income and other income expense balances 
our financial position and cash flows could be similarly impacted 
we have used forward exchange rate contracts in the past  and may continue to use derivative instruments in the future to manage the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
as of april   the loss of  recorded in oci related to the foreign exchange hedges was reclassified from oci into earnings in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed discussion of derivative financial instruments
