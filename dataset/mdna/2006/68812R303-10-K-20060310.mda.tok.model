overview we are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company committed to the clinical development and commercialization of new therapeutics to serve unmet medical needs 
we currently promote two products in the us pharmaceutical market 
our lead product is the fluoroquinolone antibiotic factive gemifloxacin mesylate tablets  indicated for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity cap and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis aecb 
the commercial sale of factive began in september and factive is currently promoted nationally by a sales team comprised of approximately representatives 
we also co promote auxilium pharmaceuticals  inc s marketed product  testim gel  a topical testosterone gel indicated for the treatment of male hypogonadism 
additionally  we are developing a novel antibiotic candidate  ramoplanin  for the treatment of clostridium difficile associated disease 
on february   we completed our merger with genesoft pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held pharmaceutical company based in south san francisco  california 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase by us under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years due to the implementation of manufacturing  distribution  marketing and sales capabilities  as well as continued research and development efforts  preclinical testing and clinical trials 
factive our lead product is factive tablets  indicated for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity  or cap  and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis  or aecb 
the product was approved for sale in the united states in april for such indications 
in october  genesoft  now a subsidiary of ours  entered into a license and option agreement with lg life sciences to develop and commercialize gemifloxacin  a novel flouroquinolone antibiotic  in north america  france  germany  the united kingdom  luxembourg  ireland  italy  spain  portugal  belgium  the netherlands  austria  greece  sweden  denmark  finland  norway  iceland  switzerland  andorra  monaco  san marino and vatican city 
this agreement was subsequently assigned to us 
the term of the agreement with respect to each country extends at least through the life of the patents covering gemifloxacin in such country 
in the united states  the last of the currently issued patents for composition of matter expires in we began selling factive tablets in september with an initial sales force of representatives and  as of december  had an approximately person sales force 
additionally  in october  we supplemented the oscient sales force with approximately contract sales representatives  hired by innovex  the contract sales arm of quintiles transnational corp 
these additional sales representatives provide double coverage in high potential territories to grow the factive physician prescribing base 

table of contents we are also seeking to expand the commercial opportunities for factive through additional development and clinical study plans for the product 
we have completed a clinical trial to demonstrate that a five day course of factive for the treatment of mild to moderate cap is as effective as the currently approved seven day course of treatment 
the fda has recently accepted for filing our supplemental snda seeking marketing approval for the use of factive for the five day treatment of cap 
the fda granted a standard ten month review period for the five day cap snda and is expected to act on the filing by the end of september the acceptance of the cap snda filing does not assure approval 
as part of the factive development program  several studies relating to acute bacterial sinusitis  or abs  were completed  however  the fda has refused to accept the snda filing for the five day treatment of abs 
in its refusal to accept the snda filing for abs  the fda indicated that factive did not exhibit an acceptable risk versus benefit profile for the abs indication 
in addition  the fda expressed the opinion that demonstrating an acceptable risk versus benefit profile for factive in abs was not feasible  given the fda s view of the potential risk of rash in those patients 
although we intend to continue our discussions with the fda regarding the abs indication  we cannot guarantee that the abs indication will ever be approved by the fda 
in addition  we plan to develop an intravenous formulation of gemifloxacin 
due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in clinical trials  we cannot predict if final results related to these efforts will be successful or when material cash flows from these programs will commence 
co promotion of testim on april   we entered into a co promotion agreement with auxilium pharmaceuticals  inc under which we and auxilium will co promote in the united states auxilium s marketed product  testim gel  a topical testosterone gel indicated for the treatment of male hypogonadism 
pursuant to the agreement  we have the exclusive right to promote testim gel jointly with auxilium to primary care physicians 
the initial term of the agreement ends on april  we may extend the agreement for two consecutive two year periods provided that we have met certain milestones for each extension related to physician detailing  market share and gross sales 
if these milestones are met and we do not elect to terminate the co promotion agreement  the first extension period will end on december  and the second extension period will end on april  both organizations have established and continue to develop a promotion plan which sets forth the responsibilities of both parties with respect to the marketing and promotion of testim gel in the us primary care physician market 
we are obligated to share testim promotional expenses to this physician market equally with auxilium 
each party will be responsible for the costs associated with its own sales force 
in addition  auxilium is obligated to pay us a co promotion fee based on a specified percentage of the gross profit from testim sales attributable to primary care physicians in the us that exceeds a specified sales threshold 
the specific percentage is based upon testim sales levels attributable to primary care physicians and the marketing expenses incurred by us in connection with the promotion of testim gel under the co promotion agreement 
the co promotion agreement can be terminated by either party upon the occurrence of certain termination events  including approval and sale of a generic form of testim gel in the united states  in which case auxilium is obligated to pay to us a specified percentage of the profits for product sales for the following two years 
also  we have been granted the exclusive option to co promote any future auxilium product candidate that treats male hypogonadism and contains testosterone as the active ingredient 
the terms and conditions of such future agreement would be negotiated in good faith by the parties at the time the option is exercised 
ramoplanin we are developing a novel investigational antibiotic candidate  ramoplanin  which is currently in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile associated disease  or cdad 
in october  we in licensed ramoplanin from vicuron pharmaceuticals inc vicuron  now a wholly owned subsidiary of pfizer inc  and on february   acquired worldwide rights from vicuron  assuming full control of ramoplanin manufacturing  development and commercialization 

table of contents we recently agreed with the fda to a special protocol assessment spa regarding the specific components of the phase iii program that  if completed successfully  would support regulatory approval for the indication 
according to the agreement reached with the fda  the required clinical development program will be comprised of two pivotal phase iii trials 
the two non inferiority studies will enroll  in each trial  approximately patients diagnosed with cdad  from centers in the united states  canada and other parts of the world 
each patient will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms  in a double blind fashion ramoplanin mg twice daily or vancomycin mg four times daily for ten days 
the primary endpoint will be the response rate at end of therapy 
once we finalize planning and implementing a clinical trial development plan with our third party contractor and secure a long term source supplier  we would be ready to initiate the phase iii program 
other alliances and research programs genomic alliances and services previously  we received payments from our product discovery alliances based on license fees  contract research and milestone payments during the term of our alliances 
our alliances could result in the discovery and commercialization of novel pharmaceutical  vaccine and diagnostic products 
in order for a product to be commercialized based on our research  it will be necessary for our alliance partners to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  obtain regulatory clearances  manufacture  sell and distribute the product 
accordingly  we do not expect to receive significant milestone payments and royalties based upon product revenues for many years  if at all 
we expect the majority of our revenue in the future to be derived from the sale of current and future products 
in the past  we have also received revenues from our genomics services business from selling  as a contract service business  high quality genomic sequencing information to our customers 
as part of our continued evolution into a product focused  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company  on march   we completed the sale of our genomics services business to privately held agencourt bioscience corporation agencourt 
we retain rights to our pathogenome database product  including all associated intellectual property  subscriptions and royalty rights on products developed by subscribers 
as part of the agreement with agencourt  we transferred our sequencing operations  including certain equipment and personnel  to agencourt for the following consideration an up front cash payment of  cash payments over a two year period ending in march totaling approximately  pursuant to a right to receive a percentage of revenues from our former commercial and government customers  and  shares of agencourt s common stock 
as a result of the acquisition of agencourt by beckman coulter  we received i a payment of approximately  during the quarter ended june   in exchange for the shares of agencourt we held  ii a payment of approximately  during the quarter ended september  due to a post closing merger adjustment  and iii the right to receive additional consideration if certain milestones are achieved by agencourt over the next three years 
internally funded early stage target research program as part of our strategic decision to concentrate on development and commercialization of our pharmaceutical products  we adopted a plan in to substantially reduce our research effort in internally funded early stage target discovery programs 
under this plan  we eliminated full time positions and paid out  related to severance costs against the restructuring liability in this charge includes associated 
table of contents severance costs  outplacement services and a non cash charge for the acceleration of vesting of previously granted stock options  as well as impairment charges related to the value of laboratory and computer equipment no longer used in operations 
on may  we entered into a license and contribution agreement with maxthera  inc  whereby we granted an exclusive license to certain patent rights relating to certain of our legacy anti infective technology 
title to these patent rights will vest in maxthera upon meeting certain financial milestones 
in consideration of the license and upon transfer of title to maxthera  we will receive shares of maxthera s common stock as well as a right to royalty payments if any products covered by the patent rights are commercialized 
on may  we entered into a license and sale agreement with azee  inc  whereby we granted an exclusive license to certain patent rights relating to genesoft s small molecule anti genomic therapeutics legacy technology 
title to these patent rights will vest in azee upon azee meeting certain financial milestones 
in consideration of the license  we received shares of azee s common stock and are entitled to royalty payments if any products covered by the patent rights are commercialized 
upon transfer of title to the patents to azee  we will receive additional shares of azee s common stock 
as a combined category  these research efforts represented and of total research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
major research and development projects research and development expenditures totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
factive gemifloxacin mesylate tablets expenses for ongoing clinical trials and other development activities for the factive product totaled approximately  in as a condition to the approval to sell factive tablets  the fda has required  as a post marketing study commitment  that we conduct a prospective  randomized study comparing factive tablets  patients to an active comparator  patients in patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community acquired pneumonia of mild to moderate severity 
this study will include patients of different ethnicities to gain safety information in populations not substantially represented in the existing clinical trial program 
patient enrollment for this phase iv trial  with approval from the fda  commenced patient enrollment during the fall of and is scheduled to be completed within three to four years 
although we cannot predict with certainty the costs necessary to complete this study  we currently estimate it will cost between million of additional spending to complete the study 
additionally  in april of  we completed a phase iii trial examining the potential use of factive tablets for the five day treatment of mild to moderate community acquired pneumonia 
based on the results of this study  in october we submitted a supplemental new drug application with the fda for approval to promote the five day treatment of factive tablets for this indication 
in january  the fda accepted our submission for filing 
we expect the fda to act on our application by the end of september there is no assurance that the fda will approve our application 
ramoplanin clinical trials and other development activities for ramoplanin constituted our most significant research and development projects in and  but were only a small part of expenditures in during  we focused on reaching agreement with the fda for a phase iii program pursuant to a special protocol assessment 
table of contents spa 
we are in the process of finalizing plans for the required clinical trials 
once our initial planning is complete  the development of ramoplanin  including cost and timing  will remain subject to numerous factors beyond our control  such as identifying centers and physicians to conduct the clinical trials  the pace of enrollment in clinical trials  possible regulatory delays of clinical trials and the strength of the data produced by a given trial 
as a results of these factors  we are unable to determine the estimated completion date or the estimated cost to complete the ramoplanin trial 
internally funded research program as part of our strategic decision to concentrate on development and commercialization of our own products  we initiated a plan in to substantially reduce our research effort in internally funded early stage target discovery programs 
under this plan  we eliminated full time positions and paid out  related to severance costs against the restructuring liability in this charge includes associated severance costs  outplacement services and a non cash charge for the acceleration of vesting of previously granted stock options  as well as impairment charges related to the value of laboratory and computer equipment no longer used in operations 
the costs for internally funded research in were minimal in comparison to our total expenditures 
with respect to our earlier stage programs  we do not track total actual costs or estimated costs to completion for each of our preclinical projects 
we have not disclosed the nature  timing and cost of the efforts necessary to complete our other projects or the anticipated completion dates  because these items are not known or estimable by us 
for instance  before we could even begin clinical trials for any of these programs  we would have to identify lead compounds  complete preclinical safety testing of these compounds and file an investigational new drug ind with the fda 
given the risk of scientific failure inherent in early stage discovery programs  we cannot predict the estimated completion date or estimated cost to complete any of our research and development projects and given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate  when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
critical accounting policies estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
our preparation of this report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition our principal source of revenue is the sale of factive tablets  which began shipping in the third quarter of in the second quarter of  we began recognizing co promotion revenue in connection with our agreement with auxilium 
other historical sources of revenue include biopharmaceutical alliances and royalties from the divested genomic services business 
in future periods  we expect our revenues derived from biopharmaceutical alliances will continue to decrease  however product revenues and co promotion revenues will continue to increase based on anticipated increased volume of prescriptions of factive tablets and testim testosterone gel 
we expect demand for factive to be higher between november and march as the incidence of respiratory tract infections  including cap and aecb  tend to increase during the winter months 
as a result  we 
table of contents expect our sales of factive to be higher during this season 
in addition  fluctuations in the severity of the annual respiratory tract infection season may cause our product sales to vary from year to year 
due to these seasonal fluctuations in demand  our results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the entire year 
product sales we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition a replacement of sab and recognize revenue from product sales upon delivery of product to wholesalers  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the wholesaler and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable allowances for sales returns  rebates  special promotional programs  and discounts 
for arrangements where the risk of loss has not passed to wholesalers or pharmacies  we defer the recognition of revenue by recording deferred revenue until such time as risk of loss has passed 
also  the cost of factive associated with amounts recorded as deferred revenue is recorded in inventory until such time as risk of loss has passed 
as of december  and  the balance of deferred revenue was and  respectively 
co promotion revenue amounts earned under our co promotion agreement with auxilium from the sale of testim gel  a product developed by auxilium  is classified as co promotion revenue in our statements of operations included in this report 
auxilium is obligated to pay us a co promotion fee based on a specified percentage of the gross profit from testim sales attributable to primary care physicians in the us that exceeds a specified sales threshold 
the specific percentage is based upon testim sales levels attributable to primary care physicians and the marketing expenses incurred by us in connection with the promotion of testim gel under the co promotion agreement 
such co promotion revenue is earned when testim units are dispensed through patient prescriptions 
there is no cost of goods sold associated with co promotion revenue  and the selling and marketing expenses incurred with respect to the co promotion arrangement are included in selling and marketing expenses 
biopharmaceutical revenue prior to the merger with genesoft  we pursued biopharmaceutical revenues through alliance partnerships with pharmaceutical companies and through government grants 
we also maintained a genomics services business 
we have now shifted our focus to the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
the declining revenues and associated expenses for the genomics services business have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
biopharmaceutical revenues have consisted of government research grants and license fees  contract research  and milestone payments from alliances with pharmaceutical companies 
genomics services revenues have consisted of government sequencing grants  fees and royalties received from custom gene sequencing  and analysis services 
sales rebates  discounts and incentives our product sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to the ultimate consumers of the product 
when we deliver our product  we reduce the amount of gross revenue recognized from such product sales based primarily on estimates of three categories of discounts and allowances product returns  sales discounts and allowances and special promotional programs that suggest that all or part of the revenue should not be recognized at the time of the delivery 

table of contents product returns factors that are considered in our estimate of future product returns include an analysis of the amount of product in the wholesaler and pharmacy channel  review of consumer consumption data as reported by external information management companies  return rates for similar competitive antibiotic products that have a similar shelf life and are sold in the same distribution channel  the remaining time to expiration of our product  and our forecast of future sales of our product 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow our customers to return product within six months prior to and six months subsequent to the expiration date of our product 
our product has a month expiration period from the date of manufacturing into a tablet 
based on the contractual terms of the product return rights  the product in the channel is eligible for return after march  at december  and  our product return reserve was approximately  and  respectively 
this reserve is evaluated on a quarterly basis  assessing each of the factors described above  and adjusted accordingly 
based on the factors noted above  we believe our estimate of product returns is reasonable  and changes  if any  from this estimate would not have a material impact to our financial statements 
cash discounts our standard invoice includes a contractual cash discount  net days terms 
based on historical experience  we estimate that most of our customers deduct a discount from their balance 
the cash discount reserve is presented as an allowance against trade receivables 
as of december  and  the balance for cash discounts was approximately  and  respectively 
rebates the liability for managed care rebates is based upon historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates contractually submitted by each state 
as of december  and the balance for managed care rebates was approximately  and  respectively 
considering the estimates made by us  as well as estimates prepared by third party utilization reports that are necessary in evaluating the required liability balance  we believe our estimates are reasonable  and changes  if any  from those estimates would not be material to the financial statements 
as of december   there have been no material changes to our estimates in the periods presented 
special promotional programs we have offered certain promotional incentives to date to our customers and may continue this practice in the future such as sample cards to end consumers  certain product incentives to pharmacy customers  and other sales stocking allowances 
examples of programs utilized to date follow voucher rebate programs during the first quarter of  we initiated a voucher rebate program which offered a mail in rebate to patients who received a factive prescription 
we have accounted for this program in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitf no 

we developed a reasonable estimate of the liability for this program based upon historical redemption rates for completed programs by utilizing a third party processing company 
the program was completed by december  during the fourth quarter of  we initiated another voucher rebate program whereby we offered mail in rebates to retail consumers 
we have accounted for this program in accordance with eitf no 
the liability we recorded for this voucher rebate program is based upon the historical rebate redemption rates for the similar completed program that we commenced in the first quarter of as of december   the balance of the liability for this voucher program was approximately  the program will expire on april  and the balance will be adjusted for the actual redemption rate 

table of contents sample card rebate program during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a sample card program whereby we offered an incentive to patients in the form of a free full course sample card for factive 
we have accounted for this program in accordance with eitf no 
we did not have sufficient history with this type of incentive program in order to develop a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount of expected reimbursement claims 
as a result  in accordance with issue of eitf no 
 we recorded the maximum reserve redemption for reimbursement claims related to sample cards distributed  which resulted in a reduction of revenues of approximately  at december  during the quarter ended september   we adjusted the reserve based upon the completion of the program which resulted in the recognition of product revenue of approximately  we may be able to consider the actual redemption rate from this program in estimating the liability for similar programs in the future 
stocking incentives during the third quarter of  in connection with the commercial launch of factive  we offered certain product stocking incentives to a number of pharmacy customers 
these incentives included products with limited guaranteed sales provisions of up to nine months from date of purchase 
as a result of these provisions  title and risk of loss of these products had not passed to the customer 
accordingly  we deferred all revenue related to these products until such time as the unit was provided to a patient with a prescription 
as of december   we had recorded deferred revenue of  related to these units 
the guaranteed sales provisions expired on september  and the remaining deferred revenue related to these units of approximately  was recognized as revenue 
clinical trial expense accrual our clinical development trials related to factive and ramoplanin are primarily performed by outside parties 
at the end of each accounting period  we estimate both the total cost and time period of the trials and the percent completed as of that accounting date 
we also adjust these estimates when final invoices are received 
for the fiscal year ended december   we adjusted our accrual for clinical trial expenditures to reflect our most current estimate of liabilities outstanding to outside parties 
however  the possibility exists that the timing or cost of the clinical trials might be longer or shorter and cost more or less than we have estimated and that the associated financial adjustments would be reflected in future periods 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the average cost method 
inventory consists of factive raw material in powder form and work in process of approximately  and  and factive finished tablets of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels  and write down inventory and marketing samples that have become obsolete  have a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or are in excess of expected requirements to cost of product revenues and marketing expense  respectively 
expired inventory will be disposed of and related costs will be written off 
during and  we recorded an inventory reserve provision of approximately  and  respectively to cost of sales related to slow moving and obsolete inventory 
at december  and  there was approximately  and  respectively  in factive sample product to be used for factive marketing programs  which is classified as an other current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
restructuring charges during the years ended december  and  we recorded restructuring charges of  and  respectively 
we also recorded a facility lease liability of  and severance related costs of  during the year ended december  in connection with the acquisition of genesoft 
we established exit plans for activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in 
table of contents accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and eitf issue no 
recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
in accordance with such standards  management makes certain judgmental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
for example  the consolidation of facilities required us to record a restructuring charge which was based on estimates of rental commitments for office and laboratory space being vacated and related costs  offset by estimated sublease income 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sublease arrangement 
if the rental market changes  our sublease assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary and could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for example  in december  we determined that the probability of subleasing our vacant space had decreased 
this caused us to lower our sublease income estimate and increase our estimated liability for the fair value of the remaining lease rentals by approximately  if we are able to identify a sublease tenant  enter into a favorable lease buy out or otherwise reassess our use of the vacant space in south san francisco  california  we may be required to further revise the restructuring accrual and accrued facilities impairment charge that we have recorded as of december  for further discussion on our restructuring activities  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

under sfas  long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability measurement and estimating the undiscounted cash flows is done at the lowest possible level for which there are identifiable assets 
if the aggregate undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  then the resulting impairment charge to be recorded is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
any write downs are recorded as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset 
we also follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 

under sfas  goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are reviewed periodically for impairment 
we perform an annual evaluation of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year to test for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
because we have a single operating segment  which is our sole reporting unit  we perform this test by comparing the fair value of the entity with our book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the book value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the book value exceeds the fair value  then we would calculate the potential impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the book value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the book value  then an impairment charge would be recorded 
as of december   we do not believe that any of our long lived assets  goodwill  and other intangible assets are impaired 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased significantly to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  product sales increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the commercial sale of factive tablets was launched in september  and thus  the year represents four months of factive revenue as opposed to a full year of revenue for 
table of contents co promotion revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to the introduction of co promoting testim during the second quarter of biopharmaceutical revenues decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december   reflecting our strategic shift to commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
our revenue mix shifted during we expect that our revenues derived from both our biopharmaceutical alliance and genomics services will be minimal in comparison to prior years 
we expect an increase in product revenues based on the sale of factive tablets and we also expect an increase in co promotion revenues based on the sale of testim due to our co promotion agreement signed in the second quarter of costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  in  primarily reflecting a full year of selling and marketing expense in due to the launch of factive in september cost of product sales increased to  in from  in the commercial sale of factive tablets was launched in september  and  thus  the current period represents a full year of sales compared to the initial product launch in the prior period 
included in the cost of product sales is  and  for and  respectively  of amortization of intangible assets associated with factive 
our gross margin on factive for the year ended december  and  after standard product cost and royalties  but excluding amortization of intangible assets  was and  respectively 
our gross product margin at december  and including amortization of intangible assets was and  respectively 
the primary reason for the improved margin was due to higher sales in and also due to approximately  of other manufacturing costs mainly related to the technology transfer to our new manufacturing site of factive tablets that was incurred in research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in research and development activities include clinical trials  other clinical development  technology transfer and process optimization for manufacturing  and early stage research and development funded internally as well as by government grants and strategic alliances 
these research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and related expenses for personnel  amortization of intangible assets and the cost of materials used in research and development 
other research and development expenses include fees paid to consultants and outside service providers 
the decrease in research and development is primarily due to a decrease of approximately  relating to the termination of the ramoplanin vre trial in july  a decrease of approximately  related to internal research effort and alliances as well as a decrease of approximately  in connection with the feasibility testing of factive manufacturing in a new contracted manufacturing site and a decrease in stock based compensation in the amount of  due to lower amortization of deferred compensation resulting from stock options that were issued as part of the merger with genesoft pharmaceuticals in and decreased expenses related to terminations of personnel following the merger 
these decreases are offset by an increase of approximately  in connection with the clinical trials for factive related to the five day cap study and the factive post marketing study 
selling and marketing expenses significantly increased to  in from  in this increase was primarily due to additional sales and marketing personnel and associated hiring costs of  and consulting costs of  increased other marketing  advertising and promotional costs of approximately  to support the launch of factive  increased costs of  associated with the promotion of testim which began in the second quarter of  offset by decreases of approximately  associated with marketing studies and other costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in primarily due to an increase in general and administrative payroll and related costs of approximately  and an increase of approximately  in other general and administrative expenses offset by a decrease in 
table of contents stock based compensation in the amount of  due to lower amortization of deferred compensation resulting from stock options that were issued as part of the merger with genesoft pharmaceuticals in and decreased expenses related to terminations of personnel following the merger 
as part of our merger with genesoft  we recorded a one time charge of approximately  in related to in process research and development expenses associated with internally funded early stage target discovery programs 
the valuation of the in process research and development of  includes a peptide deformylase inhibitor research program pdf licensed from vernalis r d limited for the treatment of infections 
restructuring charges were  in  consisting of  for the beaver street waltham massachusetts facility and  for severance costs 
other income and expense interest income increased to approximately  in from approximately  in reflecting higher yields on cash balances offset by lower overall cash balances in interest expense significantly increased to approximately  in from approximately  in in  interest expense primarily consisted of approximately  related to the issuance of million of senior convertible notes in the second quarter of  approximately  related to the issuance of million of convertible notes in connection with the genesoft merger   related to amortization of deferred financing costs along with approximately  related to non cash interest expense related to the facility lease liability 
we recorded a gain on the sale of fixed assets of approximately  and  in and  respectively  primarily related to the sale of laboratory and computer equipment  which were no longer used in operations as a result of restructuring
