item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview national healthcare corporation nhc or the company is a leading provider of long term health care services 
we operate or manage long term health care centers with  beds in states and provide other services in two additional states 
these operations are provided by separately funded and maintained subsidiaries 
we provide long term health care services to patients in a variety of settings including long term nursing centers  managed care specialty units  sub acute care units  alzheimer s care units  homecare programs  assisted living centers and independent living centers 
in addition  we provide management and accounting services to owners of long term health care centers and advisory services to national health realty  inc  nhr and prior to november  to national health investors  inc nhi 
summary of goals and areas of focus earnings to monitor our earnings  we have developed budgets and management reports to monitor labor  census  and the composition of revenues 
because of changes in government reimbursement methodology  revenues from medicare are expected to decline modestly in inflationary increases in our costs may cause net earnings from patient services to decline 
development and growth the long term care industry has gone through a long period of financial distress caused by material reductions in government payments for services and dramatic increases in the cost of professional liability insurance 
as a result  we have limited our expansion efforts and used cash generated from operations to repay debt and build liquidity 
during the third quarter of  we began construction of a bed addition to an existing long term care facility located in farragut  tennessee and a bed addition to an existing long term care facility located in mauldin  south carolina 
both of these additions are to facilities that we lease from nhr 
we estimate that the costs of the additions will be approximately  and we have incurred accumulated costs of approximately  at december  in addition  we started renovations in april  at a facility we lease from nhi located in lewisburg  tennessee 
we anticipate the costs of the renovations will be approximately  and we have incurred accumulated costs of approximately  at december  construction is expected to begin in at two additional centers that we lease from nhr to add beds at an expected cost of  during  we will apply for certificates of need for additional beds in our markets and also evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets by building private pay health care centers 

table of contents in we are continuing to develop an active hospice program in selected areas through our partnership with the recently formed caris healthcare and are also exploring opportunities to expand our home health care services 
nhi lease renewal on december   we reached an agreement with national health investors  inc to extend our lease of properties through december   with three additional five year renewal options  each at fair market value 
this lease extension assures our long term use of these properties which we developed 
nhr lease renewal effective august   we reached an agreement with national health realty  inc nhr to extend our lease of properties through december   with an additional renewal option for years at fair market value 
this lease extension assures our long term use of these properties which we developed 
accrued risk reserves our accrued professional liability reserves  workers compensation reserves and health insurance reserves totaled  at the end of and are a primary area of management focus 
we have set aside restricted cash to fully fund our professional liability and workers compensation reserves 
as to the tragic fire on september  at the nashville skilled nursing subsidiary  we have settled of the lawsuits filed against the company and will continue to vigorously defend against the allegations in the lawsuits while seeking settlement and final resolution with the families 
as to the risks of fire  we have installed fire sprinklers in all of our owned and leased long term care centers that were not already so equipped 
in addition  we have implemented a comprehensive fire safety training program at all of our centers and reviewed and modified  if necessary  our priority safety procedures 
as to exposure for professional liability claims  we have developed for our centers performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure  including in house acquired pressure ulcers  significant weight loss and numbers of falls 
these programs for certification  which we regularly modify and improve  have produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents 
our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction 
furthermore  we are continuing efforts to identify and restructure the ownership or management of our higher risk operations and locations to eliminate nhc liability exposure 
as to workers compensation claims  we have implemented programs such as safety boards  safety awards  and tracking systems for days without a lost time accident to bring focus to these risks at all of our locations 
as to health insurance claims  we changed our health plan network provider to obtain better discounts in and we continue to evaluate our health plan design to identify opportunities for improvements and cost savings 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are as follows revenue recognition third party payors approximately   and of our net revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
for the cost report years and  we have submitted various requests for exceptions to medicare routine cost limitations for reimbursement 
we received 
table of contents preliminary intermediary approval on  of these requests in after settlement of outstanding litigation styled braeuning  et al vs 
national healthcare lp  et al 
we have  in addition  made provisions of approximately  for other various medicare and medicaid issues for current and prior year cost reports 
consistent with our revenue recognition policies  we will record revenues associated with the approved requests and the other various issues when the approvals  including the final cost report audits  are assured 
the three year review period expired in for approximately  of the routine cost limit exceptions and this amount was recorded as revenue in even though we received no cash payments for this revenue in adjustments of a similar nature were not significant in revenue recognition private pay for private pay patients in skilled nursing or assisted living facilities  we bill room and board in advance for the current month with payment being due upon receipt of the statement in the month the services are performed 
charges for ancillary  pharmacy  therapy and other services to private patients are billed in the month following the performance of services 
all billings are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
accrued risk reserves we are principally self insured for risks related to employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
our accrued risk reserves primarily represent the accrual for self insured risks associated with employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
the accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims 
our policy with respect to a significant portion of our workers compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to support the estimates recorded for incurred but unreported claims 
our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical claims paid 
we reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis 
professional liability remains an area of particular concern to us 
the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
as of december   we and or our managed centers are defendants in such claims inclusive of years through in addition  two lawsuits are currently pending relative to a september  fire at our nashville llc skilled nursing subsidiary 
this litigation may still take several years to reach final resolution 
there have been no additional claims asserted that are related to the events of september  since it remains possible that these pending matters plus potential unasserted claims could exceed our reserves  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
it is also possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these reserve estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
we maintain insurance coverage for incidents occurring in all provider locations owned  leased or managed by us 
the coverages include both primary policies and umbrella policies 
for  we maintain primary coverage through our own insurance company with excess coverage provided by a third party insurance company 
for  we maintain both primary and excess coverage through our own insurance subsidiary 
in all years  settlements  if any  in excess of available insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us 
revenue recognition uncertain collections we provide management services to certain long term care facilities and to others we provide accounting and financial services 
we generally charge of net revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided 
however  there are certain of the third parties with which we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that the service revenue realization is uncertain and our policy is to recognize income only in the period in which the amounts are collected 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 

table of contents certain of our accounts receivable from private paying patients and certain of our notes receivable are subject to credit losses 
we have attempted to reserve for expected accounts receivable credit losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
we continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our notes receivable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of the receivables changes over time 
we continually review and refine our estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these balances 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
potential recognition of deferred income during  we sold the assets of eight long term health care centers to national health corporation national  our administrative general partner at the time of the sale 
the resulting profit of  was deferred and will be amortized into income beginning with the collection of the note receivable up to  with the balance  of the profit being amortized into income on a straight line basis over the management contract period 
 of the previously deferred income will be recognized as income at the time of and in proportion to the collection of the associated  note 
additional deferred income of  will be reported when the company no longer has an obligation to advance the  working capital loan 
the collection or alternatively  the offset against certain payables to national of up to  of notes receivable would result in the immediate recognition of up to  of pretax net income 
currently  the notes are due december  guarantees we guarantee the debt of managed and other long term health care centers  and the debt of national and the esop 
we recorded a liability in the amount of  related to our guarantee of  of debt of six long term health care centers in florida 
we recorded this liability based upon our estimate of the value of the underlying collateral of the loans 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments to our estimates and liability under these guarantees and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
tax contingencies nhc continually evaluates for tax related contingencies 
contingencies may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment 
we believe we have adequate provisions for tax contingencies 
however  because of uncertainty of interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized by management  we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

as discussed above in the application of critical accounting policies section  amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
see application of critical accounting policies for discussion of the effects that this revenue concentration and the uncertainties related to such revenues have on our revenue recognition policies 

table of contents government program financial changes cost containment will continue to be a priority for federal and state governments for health care services  including the types of services we provide 
medicare effective october   pps rates were increased by a annual inflation update factor 
revenues for the fourth quarter of reflected the continuation of the temporary add on payments 
we estimate that the positive revenue effect of the cms final rule was  for the fourth quarter of including inflation  total medicare payments to all providers in fy as projected by cms will be the same as total payments made to all providers in fy however  the final rule will cause a redistribution of payments among providers 
this is accomplished by refinements expanding the resource utilization groups rugs from rug groups to rug groups and by eliminating temporary rate add ons 
the elimination of temporary add ons has always been tied to the long awaited rug refinement 
rug refinement increases the case mix weight that applies to both nursing and non ancillary therapy ancillary costs 
this is a permanent change in the pps methodology 
excluding the annual inflation update factor  rug refinement is expected to reduce our medicare payment rates approximately per patient day beginning january   thereby reducing revenues and pre tax income by approximately million 
the deficit reduction act dra of mandates the reduction of bad debt payments  which payments are included in patient revenues  to skilled nursing facilities over a three year phase in period 
the first year  fy  reduction would be or  year two would be a reduction with year three and beyond holding at similar to inpatient hospitals 
payments to home health agencies increased by effective january  effective april  the rural add on of was eliminated causing a decrease in revenues 
in effect  the increase in inflation and loss of the rural add on offset resulting in no significant increase or decrease in revenues for fy the deficit reduction act dra of  if adopted as proposed  would mandate the home health payment rate for would be frozen 
hhas serving rural beneficiaries would see a one year five percent add on payment under the legislation 
the rural add on payment would provide for a increase in total payments  for our homecare operations approximately million in fy due to a significant number our homecares serving rural counties 
medicaid tennessee annual medicaid rate increases have been delayed in due to submission of a new plan to cms 
the new plan substitutes a new funding methodology called certified patient expenditures cpe for inter governmental transfers igt 
in effect our rates in tennessee have been frozen for a year and a half as of december  if approved  it is anticipated that the rate increase would be retroactive to july  the increase in revenue is estimated to be approximately  per quarter 
missouri medicaid cut their rates effective april   and was unable to fund the second and third year of the expected rebasing of fy audited cost reports 
the april  rate change reduced our revenues  in the failure to implement the rebasing decreased revenues by approximately  in each year since south carolina medicaid annual per diem rate increases are expected to result in additional revenues of approximately  for the next four quarters

increases in other operating costs and expenses are due in part to increases in the costs of health insurance and to increased census at our long term care beds and assisted living units which opened in may and long term care beds which opened in august increases were offset in part due to decreases in professional liability insurance and workers compensation insurance 
expenses also included a loss of  for the write down of a note receivable in march  this note receivable is due from a bed long term health care center in missouri that we manage 
as a result of increased operating costs and the lack of increase in reimbursement rates  the cash flows of this center declined and the center has not made a principal payment on this note since december  based on an analysis consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

statement amends apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  that was issued in the amendments made by statement are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the 
table of contents amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  opinion required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the provisions in statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june   and as such  the company is unable to assess the impact on the financial statements 
early application is permitted and companies must apply the standard prospectively

statement requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
statement also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years 
however  rates paid under the medicare and medicaid programs do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs 
therefore  there can be no assurance that future rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases in our labor and other health care service costs
