item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system in conjunction with our proprietary excimer laser system 
excimer laser technology delivers comparatively cool ultraviolet energy in short  controlled energy pulses to ablate or remove tissue 
our excimer laser system includes the cvx laser unit and various fiber optic delivery devices  including disposable catheters and sheaths 
our excimer laser system is the only excimer laser system approved in the united states and europe for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular applications 
our excimer laser system is used in complex atherectomy procedures to open clogged or obstructed arteries in the coronary and peripheral vascular system 
it is also used to remove lead wires from patients with implanted pacemakers or defibrillators  which are electronic devices that regulate the heartbeat 
on april   we obtained k marketing clearance from the food and drug administration fda for a laser based treatment of total occlusions blockages in the legs not crossable with a guidewire 
some of the patients with total occlusions in the leg suffer from critical limb ischemia cli  a debilitating condition that begins with resting leg pain and can lead to tissue loss or amputation as a result of a lack of blood flow to the legs 
following this clearance we launched our clirpath product line for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease  in sizes ranging from 
millimeters to millimeters in diameter 

table of contents we are in the early stages of scientific research for a laser based treatment of acute myocardial infarction  or heart attack  as well as peripheral vascular disease 
we are currently sponsoring ongoing clinical trials as described below peripheral vascular disease 
we have recently initiated three feasibility clinical trials using our laser technology in below the knee lesions  acute limb ischemia  and the measurement of the lumen size created by our recently launched turbo catheter 
we plan to complete these feasibility projects in and  depending on the clinical data  may initiate larger clinical trials 
further  we are seeking fda approval to begin a pivotal trial for the treatment of larger diameter vessels within the legs 
following fda approval  which we anticipate during the first half of  we intend to initiate a patient registry between and patients  at multiple centers in the united states and europe 
however  we cannot assure you that this fda approval will be received when anticipated or at all 
the objective of the trial is to demonstrate atherectomy  or the removal of tissue  in the larger diameter superficial femoral artery 
clinical data from the registry will be used to seek fda k clearance for the device 
ami  or heart attack 
we are currently conducting a prospective registry at up to sites in the us and europe that has enrolled patients 
the extended famili trial is a feasibility trial that will benchmark quantitative endpoints common in other ami trials  such as myocardial blush scores and the reduction in infarct size for a subset of patients 
the trial includes day and month clinical follow up 
enrollment in the trial was completed during the first half of we expect to complete the six month follow up and data analysis in based on the clinical data  we may utilize it for marketing purposes and may pursue additional clinical research in this area 
chronic occlusions 
we intend to initiate a pivotal trial in evaluating use of our superwire product for the treatment of chronic occlusions in the heart 
the superwire is designed to cross occlusions that are not crossable by standard guidewires 
our business strategy is to accelerate revenue growth through increased utilization of our existing products  continued expansion in our installed base of laser systems and development of additional applications for our laser technology 
we are also considering business development activities  such as distribution of complementary products  research and product development partnerships and acquisitions that support our business strategy 
income before income taxes was  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  the increase in pre tax income was due primarily to an increase in revenue primarily due to increased sales of atherectomy products  partially offset by increased operating expenses related to the overall growth of our business 
net income was  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared with net income of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  included a  income tax benefit  which represented the release of a valuation allowance that was determined to no longer be required on specific deferred taxes 
as of january   we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
we have adopted statement r on the prospective basis as defined in the statement 
under this adoption method  we will record expense relating to employee stock based compensation awards in the periods subsequent to adoption 
this expense will be based on all unvested options as of the adoption date as well as all future stock based compensation awards 
our pretax expense for those options is expected to be between million and million 
in addition  we expect to record stock compensation expense of between million and million related to new stock options granted in  with the actual amount being dependent on the actual number of options granted  the market price of our stock  and other factors 
while we have not yet fully quantified the impact of adopting statement r  we believe that such adoption could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the future

financial results by geographical segment in thousands revenue united states europe total revenue in thousands net income united states europe total net income includes an income tax benefit of  at december   we recorded a net deferred tax asset of  which represented our best estimate of the amount of our deferred tax assets that were more likely than not to be realized through the reduction of income taxes payable in future years 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue during the year ended december  was  an increase of compared with  during the year ended december   as a result of increased revenue in all revenue categories  but driven primarily by growth in disposable products revenue 
disposable products revenue was  for the year ended december   which was higher than disposable products revenue of  during the same period in the revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases  however  average unit prices also increased slightly across virtually all of our disposable product categories  accounting for approximately of the disposables revenue growth  primarily due to a higher mix of clirpath catheters which carry a higher unit selling price than other products 
we separate our disposable products revenue into two separate categories atherectomy and lead removal 
for the year ended december   our atherectomy revenue totaled  of disposable products revenue and our lead removal revenue totaled  of our disposable products revenue 
atherectomy revenue grew and was the main driver of disposable product revenue growth in compared with atherectomy revenue includes products used in both the coronary and peripheral vascular system 
additionally  our quick cross support catheters contributed to the athorectomy revenue growth  accounting for of the growth 
lead removal revenue grew during compared with we continue to believe our lead removal revenue is increasing primarily as a result of the increase in use of implantable cardioverter 
table of contents defibrillators icd  devices that regulate heart rhythm 
when an icd is implanted  it often replaces a pacemaker 
in these cases  the old pacemaker leads may be removed to minimize venous obstruction when the new icd leads are implanted 
recent clinical studies madit and scd heft have expanded the patient population that may benefit from defibrillator implants 
the results of the madit clinical trial became available in and the scd heft clinical trial results were made public in february growth in the implantable defibrillator market may accelerate  depending on the establishment of referral patterns to electrophysiologists for this expanded patient pool and the additional reimbursement recently established for the hospitals and electrophysiologists who treat these patients  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
generally  growth in the implantable defibrillator market contributes to growth in our lead removal business 
although we expect our lead removal business to continue to grow  there can be no assurances to that effect 
the current standard of care in this market is to cap leads and leave them in the body rather than lead removal 
we have initiated programs to examine the costs and frequency of complications associated with abandoned leads  but there are no assurances that these programs will be successful or will change the current standard of care 
laser equipment revenue in was  compared with  in  which represents an increase of 
the increase is primarily due to higher rental revenue from laser systems placed with customers under our various rental programs 
most of the increase in our laser system placements from to related to systems placed under our evergreen and cap free rental programs  as opposed to outright sales  and we expect in that the large majority of our new laser placements will be under the cap free program 
we believe that laser system placements is a more relevant metric for measuring our progress within the equipment business  as it represents new customers that have elected to acquire or are considering the acquisition of a laser system  whether it be from an outright sale from inventory  or an evaluation or rental program 
the laser system placement represents an opportunity to sell our higher margin disposable products 
as of december  our worldwide installed base of laser systems was in the united states compared with in the united states as of december  this represents new laser placements in of laser systems compared to new laser systems placed during the increase in laser placements in is largely driven by customer interest in our clirpath product line used for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease 
information as to our installed base of laser systems and new laser placements includes outright sales  rentals and lasers being evaluated during a trial period by potential purchasers 
service and other revenue of  during increased from  for service and other revenue is generated through the repair and maintenance services offered to our customers and is associated exclusively with our laser systems 
the growth in service and other revenue is a result of an increase in our installed base 
gross profit increased to as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december  as compared with during the year ended december  the improved gross margin is primarily attributable to increased manufacturing efficiencies within laser system and catheter manufacturing as a result of increased unit volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  as compared with  in  due to the following selling expenses increased  due to the following factors approximately  relates to personnel related expenses associated with the hiring of additional employees in within our sales organization 
these increased costs include salaries  recruiting and travel costs 
an additional  of the increase relates to higher commissions expense as a result of our increased revenue compared with the prior year 
additional physician training costs incurred primarily in peer to peer clinical training sessions combined with increased convention  meeting and education costs primarily the result of attendance at an increasing number of tradeshows and conventions accounted for approximately  of the increase 

table of contents increased expenses associated with the operations of spectranetics international  bv  our wholly owned subsidiary in the netherlands that serves the european market represented approximately  of the increase 
of this amount  approximately  relates to costs associated with the hiring of an additional employee for the european sales organization and for the payment of additional commissions on increased sales in europe for as compared to an additional increase of approximately  is due to increased expenses associated with convention attendance and other marketing related activities and materials 
the remaining  of the increase is associated with the strengthening euro in relation to the us dollar 
approximately  of the increase relates to higher commissions paid to our independent distributor for increased sales made in asia 
additional depreciation costs of  associated with a higher number of evaluation systems in place at december  compared with refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this report for a further discussion of these programs 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately  as a result of increased legal fees of approximately  primarily due to the legal proceedings associated with the rentrop and edwards lawsuits

increased property and franchise taxes of approximately  research  development and other technology expenses include royalty expenses  research and development expenses  and clinical study expenses 
for the year ended december   research  development and other technology expenses rose to  from  during the year ended december  the reasons for the increases are shown below increased personnel related costs of approximately  due to the hiring of additional engineering staff for the development of new products for our technology 
increased legal fees of approximately  related mainly to the application and maintenance of patents and the fees associated with the preparation of project and other agreements as well as increased other outside professional services of approximately  related primarily to consulting services engaged in specific development projects 
higher royalty expenses of approximately  due primarily to an additional provision of  to increase the reserve for the estimated settlement of a royalty dispute as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this was partially offset by the expiration of certain patents underlying licensed technology and decreased royalty rates for certain other existing license agreements 
increased materials and other supplies costs of approximately  due to increased research and development activities during as compared to other income of  for the year ended december  decreased from other income during of  due to  of interest expense which was awarded to edwards lifesciences by an arbitrator s decision in a royalty dispute case that is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this was partially offset by an increase in interest income of approximately  due primarily to an increase in our investment portfolio interest rate yields consistent with overall changes in the interest rate 
table of contents environment during our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of government or government agency securities with maturities less than two years 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes of  or of income before income tax expense  compared to an income tax benefit of  for the prior year 
the income tax benefit included the release of  related to a valuation allowance that is no longer required on specific deferred tax assets 
the amount represented the value of net operating losses and future temporary deductible differences between book and taxable income that we determined were more likely than not going to be realized in the form of reduced taxable income in future years 
subsequent to recording the net deferred tax asset in  in we have provided the full amount of income tax expense against current earnings 
our effective tax rate exceeds the federal statutory rate due primarily to provisions for state taxes as well as non deductible meals and entertainment expense 
net income for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  compared with  or per diluted share during the year ended december  net income decreased in based on the reasons discussed herein  primarily due to the change in income tax benefit expense 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue during the year ended december  was  an increase of compared with  during the year ended december   as a result of increased revenue in all revenue categories  but driven primarily by growth in disposable products revenue 
disposable products revenue was  for the year ended december   which was higher than disposable products revenue of  during the same period in the revenue growth was almost entirely due to unit volume increases  however  a small price increase initiated in april across virtually all of our disposable products contributed to approximately  or  of revenue growth in as compared with we separate our disposable products revenue into two separate categories atherectomy and lead removal 
for the year ended december   our atherectomy revenue totaled  of disposable products revenue and our lead removal revenue totaled  of our disposable products revenue 
atherectomy revenue grew and was the main driver of disposable product revenue growth in compared with atherectomy revenue includes products used in both the coronary and peripheral vascular system 
atherectomy revenue growth is primarily due to the launch of our clirpath product line in may  following april fda clearance to market these products to treat total occlusions in the legs that are not crossable with a guidewire 
the fda clearance covered catheter sizes ranges from 
millimeters in diameter to millimeters in diameter 
most of these catheters were marketed for coronary use prior to the fda clearance  however  the catheters with a diameter from millimeters to millimeters were new products not previously marketed 
these new catheters accounted for  of revenue for the period between may  and december  and accounted for most of the revenue growth within the atherectomy product line 
lead removal revenue grew during compared with we continue to believe our lead removal revenue is increasing primarily as a result of the increase in use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators icd  devices that regulate heart rhythm 
laser equipment revenue in was  compared with  in  which represents an increase of 
the increase is primarily due to higher average selling prices in  in versus  in and a slight increase in unit volumes sold in versus in 
average selling prices may vary significantly from year to year based on geographic mix and age of the laser systems 
the age of the laser system sold relates to those customers who elected to purchase a laser system that had previously been used under an evaluation or rental program 
we believe that laser system placements is a more relevant metric for measuring our progress within the equipment business  as it represents new customers that have elected to acquire or are considering the acquisition of a laser system  whether it be from an outright sale from inventory  or an evaluation or rental program

net income for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  compared with  or per diluted share during the year ended december  net income increased in based on the reasons discussed herein 
income taxes at december   we have net operating loss carryforwards for united states federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
this amount does not include approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards which are limited under section of the internal revenue code of no deferred tax asset has been provided for million of net operating losses as we have determined that we will not receive any future tax benefit from this million before their expiration 
we also have tax loss carryforwards in the netherlands  which have no expiration date  of approximately million euros million us dollars available to offset future taxable income  if any 
in  the netherlands tax authorities proposed that substantially all of the tax loss carryforwards be disallowed 
we are actively defending these loss carryforwards 
these foreign loss carryforwards have been fully reserved with a valuation allowance 
if the tax loss carryforwards are ultimately disallowed  there will be no negative impact to the financial statements 
an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of  is available to offset future regular tax liabilities and has no expiration date 
for alternative minimum tax purposes  we have unrestricted net operating loss carryforwards for united states federal income tax purposes of approximately million

table of contents at december   based upon the level of historical income and projections for future income  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of  as we have determined it is more likely than not a portion of the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current and long term investment securities of  a decrease of  from  at december  we consider the total of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities to be available for operating activities since the cash equivalents and investment securities can be readily converted to cash 
as discussed above under legal proceedings  in january we remitted payment of  to a licensor in connection with an arbitration proceeding 
cash and cash equivalents were  at december  compared with  at december   an increase of  during  we received  from the sale of common stock to employees  primarily through stock option exercises 
these proceeds were generally not moved to investments  in anticipation of increased operating cash requirements related to the growth of our business 
all investment securities consist of government and government agency securities 
our current and long term investment securities portfolio totaled  at december  compared with  at december  long term investment securities have a maturity of more than one year but no more than two years 
for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities totaled  and consisted primarily of the following an increase in equipment held for rental or loan of  as a result of expanding placement activity of our laser systems through evaluation  cap free  or rental programs 
an increase in trade accounts receivable of  due to increased sales 
increased inventories of  primarily the result of higher stocking levels to meet the increase in laser and catheter demand the above uses of cash by operating activities were partially offset by the following sources for the year ended december  net income of  plus non cash expenses of  which consisted of depreciation and amortization of  deferred income taxes of  and the fair value of options granted for consulting services of  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  as a result of increased purchasing activity  increased payroll related accruals and increased royalty and related interest accruals 
we continue to stay focused on the management of accounts receivable as measured by days sales outstanding and will continue this focus in with the goal of maintaining the current level of days sales outstanding  although there can be no assurances this goal will be achieved 
for the equipment held for rental or loan account  any increases will be based on the level of evaluation or rental including cap free laser placements offset by sales of laser systems previously placed under evaluation or rental programs 
we continue to expect the majority of our laser placement activity in to be in the form of cap free units 
for the year ended december   cash used by investing activities was  capital expenditures during totaled  in addition  we also purchased a building used primarily for catheter manufacturing for  that was previously under lease 
these outlays for property and equipment were offset by sales net of purchases of investment securities of  because of budgeted manufacturing capacity expansion projects  additional research and development projects requiring capital and additional enterprise software purchases  we expect capital expenditures in to exceed  although the actual amount of capital expenditures may be different 
the decrease in cash used by investing activities is the result of the fact that in  we made purchases of investment securities net of 
table of contents sales of  due to increasing interest rates in and the improved interest yields available on these securities compared with cash equivalents 
this was partially offset by the resolution of a legal dispute with one of our licensors that allowed us to reclassify  from restricted cash to operating cash 
net cash provided by financing activities was  during the year ended december  financing activities consist of proceeds from sale of common stock to employees  primarily through the exercise of stock options but also as a result of stock purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our currently budgeted operating needs for the coming twelve months 
in the event we need additional funds for the operation of our business  we will consider additional sources of financing  including public or private financings 
we cannot assure you that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed 
at december  and  we had placed a number of systems on rental  cap free  and loan programs 
a total of  and  was recorded as equipment held for rental or loan at december  and  respectively  and is being depreciated over three to five years  depending on whether the laser system is new or remanufactured 
we currently offer three placement programs in addition to the sale of laser systems evergreen rental program rental revenue under this program varies on a sliding scale depending on the customer s catheter purchases each month 
rental revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized upon invoicing 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within cost of revenue based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
we also offer a straight monthly rental program and there are a small number of hospitals that pay  rent per month under this program 
as of december   laser units were in place under the evergreen program  all of which are in the united states 
cap free rental program under this program  we retain title to the laser system and the customer agrees to a catheter price list that includes a per unit surcharge 
customers are expected  but not required  to make minimum purchase of catheters at regular intervals  and we reserve the right to have the unit returned should the minimum purchases not be made 
we recognize the total surcharge as revenue each month  believing it to be the best measurement of revenue associated with the customers use of the laser unit each month

costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
as of december   laser units were in place under the cap free program 
evaluation programs we loan a laser system to an institution for use over a short period of time  usually three to six months 
the loan of the equipment is to create awareness of our products and their capabilities  and no revenue is earned or recognized in connection with the placement of a loaned laser  although sales of disposable products result from the laser placement 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment and depreciation expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expense based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
as of december   laser units were in place under the evaluation program in the united states  outside the united states 
these laser systems contribute to revenue immediately through the sales of disposable products to customers that have acquired a laser system under an evaluation program 
in each of the years ended december  and  customers elected to purchase their evaluation laser systems  which accounted for a total of  and  of equipment revenue  respectively 

table of contents contractual obligations the company leases office space  furniture and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with initial terms that expire at various dates through purchase obligations consist of purchase orders issued primarily for inventory

the euro was adopted as its functional currency on january  the conversion to the euro did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and their impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those relating to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  royalty obligations  reorganization costs  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of our disposable products is recognized when products are shipped and title transfers to the customer 
revenue from the sale of excimer laser systems is recognized after completion of contractual obligations  which generally include delivery and installation of the system and  in some cases  completion of physician training 
our team of field service engineers are responsible for installation of each laser and  in some cases  participation in the training program at each site 
we generally provide a one year warranty on laser sales  which includes parts  labor and replacement gas 
upon expiration of the warranty period  we offer similar service to our customers under service contracts or on a fee for service basis 
revenue from service contracts is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the related service contract period  which is generally one year 
revenue from fee for service arrangements is recognized upon completion of the service 
we offer three laser system placement programs  which are described below  in addition to the sale of laser systems evergreen rental program rental revenue under this program varies on a sliding scale depending on the customer s catheter purchases each month 
rental revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized upon invoicing 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within cost of revenue based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 

table of contents cap free rental program under this program  we retain title to the laser system and the customer agrees to a catheter price list that includes a per unit surcharge 
customers are expected  but not required  to make minimum purchases of catheters at regular intervals  and we reserve the right to have the unit returned should the minimum purchases not be made 
we recognize the total surcharge as revenue each month  believing it to be the best measurement of revenue associated with the customers use of the laser unit each month 
evaluation programs we loan a laser system to an institution for use over a short period of time  usually three to six months 
the loan of the equipment is to create awareness of our products and their capabilities  and no revenue is earned or recognized in connection with the placement of a loaned laser  although sales of disposable products result from the laser placement 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expense based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit 
we adopted emerging issues task force bulletin eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on july  the primary impact of the adoption of eitf was to treat service provided during the one year warranty period as a separate unit of accounting 
as such  the fair value of this service is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the related warranty period 
revenue allocated to the laser element is recognized upon completion of contractual obligations in the sales contract  which generally includes delivery and installation of the laser system and  in some cases  completion of physician training 
prior to july   revenue for the sale of laser equipment and the one year warranty was recognized upon shipment of the laser 
deferred revenue associated with service to be performed during the warranty period totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
allowance for sales returns 
we estimate product sales returns based on historical experience 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts are subject to change 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
we have recorded a loss contingency of approximately million including  of interest expense on the amount owed related primarily to a disagreement with one of our existing licensors  based on amounts awarded to the licensor through arbitration proceedings 
the disagreement centered around the treatment of revenues attributed to training services we provide to our customers 
we did not believe these revenues were within the scope of the license agreement and the licensors disagree 
this dispute has been settled subsequent to december  and involved a payment of  to settle the dispute 
see the commitments and contingencies footnote to our financial statements for a further discussion of these matters 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based compensation plans for employees in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we attempt to place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities  which consist of both fixed and variable rate financial instruments 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale  and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component in stockholders equity  net of applicable taxes 
at any time  sharp changes in interest rates can affect the value of our investment portfolio and its interest earnings 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
since our investment securities have maturities that are generally less than one year and not more than two years  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment securities 
as of december   the unrealized loss on our investment securities was  as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  and current and long term investment securities of million 
overall average duration to maturity for all cash and marketable securities is less than one year with of the portfolio under one year and the remaining between one 
table of contents and two years 
the weighted average interest rate earned on the portfolio is 
at december   the marketable securities consisted of government or government agency securities 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is primarily related to sales of our products in europe  which are denominated in the euro 
changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our revenue and net income 
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may increase over time as our business evolves and our products continue to be introduced into international markets 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  could incur unanticipated gains or losses 
for the year ended december   approximately  of increased revenue and  of increased operating expenses were the result of exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to the euro 
accordingly  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on consolidated net income for the year ended december  was a decrease in net income of
