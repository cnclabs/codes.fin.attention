item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report on form k 
overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops  and markets proprietary  advanced analog and mixed signal integrated circuits  or ics 
we currently offer products that serve multiple markets including notebook computers  flat panel displays  cellular handsets  digital cameras  wireless local area network lan access points  home entertainment systems  and personal digital assistants among others 
throughout we continued to expand our global presence working with third parties in asia to manufacture and assemble our integrated circuits  testing facilities in the united states  and sales offices in korea  japan  taiwan  china and marketing representatives in europe 
we believe we differentiate ourselves by offering integrated circuits solutions that are more highly integrated  smaller in size  more energy efficient  more accurate with respect to performance specifications  and  accordingly  more cost effective than many competing solutions 
as we continue to grow our business  we plan to introduce additional new products within our existing product families and other products that include voltage references and low dropout regulators 
a further description of our products may be found in part i  item i of this report under the heading business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements are  by their nature  uncertain and unpredictable  and depend upon  among other things  many factors outside of our control  such as demand for our products and economic conditions 
accordingly  our estimates and judgments may prove to be incorrect and actual 
table of contents results may differ  perhaps significantly  from these estimates under different estimates  assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab issued by the staff of the sec 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
the application of these criteria has resulted in our recognizing revenue upon shipments when title passes to customers 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
the majority of our sales are made through distribution arrangements with third parties 
we recognize revenue upon our shipment to those third party distributors under these distribution arrangements 
although some of these arrangements include limited stock rotation rights that permit the return of a small percent of the previous six months purchases  we have not experienced any significant returns pursuant to these provisions 
our normal payment terms with our distributors are days from invoice date  and our arrangements with our largest distributors do not include price protection provisions 
although some of our arrangements with certain distributors include price protection provisions permitting them a credit for unsold inventory if we reduce our list prices  we have not experienced any significant claims pursuant to these provisions 
in addition  the terms in a majority of our distribution agreements include the non exclusive right to sell  and the agreement to use best efforts to promote and develop a market for  our products in certain regions of the world and the ability to terminate the agreement by either party with up to three months notice 
estimated sales returns are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 
prior to august   we provided a standard day warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods  provide replacements at no charge to the customer  or refund amounts to the customer for defective products 
effective august   we extended the warranty period to one year for all our products 
estimated warranty costs are based on historical experience by product and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or its current estimated market value 
we write down inventory for obsolescence or lack of demand on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
accounting for income taxes 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 

table of contents our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based  in part  on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome  changes in accounting or tax laws in the united states us  or foreign jurisdictions where we operate  or changes in other facts or circumstances 
in addition  we recognize liabilities for potential us and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment  we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements  accordingly 
as of december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  attributable to management s determination that a portion of the deferred tax assets associated with certain stock based compensation transactions will not be realized 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million  attributable principally to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 
contingencies 
we are engaged in legal proceedings resulting from several patent infringement actions  two of which also include claims for trade secret misappropriation 
in addition  from time to time  we become aware that we are subject to other contingent liabilities 
when this occurs  we will evaluate the appropriate accounting for the potential contingent liabilities using statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  to determine whether a contingent liability should be recorded 
in making this determination  management may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the facts and circumstances in each matter  we use our judgment to determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss has occurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated 
if we determine a loss is probable and estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we take into account advice received from experts for each specific matter regarding the status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations which may be ongoing prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by management need to be adjusted as additional information becomes available  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
alternatively  if the judgments and estimates made by management are adjusted  for example  if a particular contingent loss does not occur  the contingent loss recorded would be reversed which could result in a favorable impact on results of operations 
accounting for stock based compensation 
our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
using the multiple option attribution method  we amortize deferred stock based compensation over the vesting periods of the related options  which are generally four years  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and we have recorded deferred stock based compensation representing the difference between the deemed fair market value of our common stock at the grant date and the option exercise price 
prior to our initial public offering  we determined the fair market value of our common stock based upon several factors  including trends in the broad market for technology stocks and the expected valuation we 
table of contents would obtain in an initial public offering 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the fair market value of our common stock  materially different amounts of stock based compensation could have been reported 
pro forma information regarding net loss attributable to common stockholders and net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is required in order to show our net loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
this information is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of options issued  pursuant to our option plan at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
warranty reserves 
warranty reserves were established beginning august  due to a change in the standard warranty period in our agreements with our customers 
we provide a month warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods  provide replacement products at no charge to the customer or refund amounts to the customer for defective products 
we record estimated warranty costs  which are based on historical experience over the preceding months by product  at the time we recognize product revenue 
as the complexity of our products increases  we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced  and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp fas 
the american jobs creation act introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
the company currently has no plans to repatriate foreign earnings 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb opinion to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
rather  the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
in april  the sec delayed the effective date of sfas r 
sfas r is effective for us as of the interim reporting period beginning january  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense is affected by our stock price  the number of stock based awards our board of directors may grant in  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we are currently finalizing the stock based compensation expense that will be recognized under sfas r  however  we believe that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces apb opinion no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 

table of contents sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt sfas in the first quarter of and does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition

revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue primarily resulted from increased sales volume of our dc to dc converter products  which increased million  or 
the increase in dc to dc products is mainly due to higher sales volumes from existing products used in consumer electronic applications  including tvs and portable dvds  and revenue from new products which began shipping in revenue from lcd backlight inverter products increased million or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenue for our audio amplifier product family increased million  or  primarily due to increased demand for existing products used in consumer electronic applications  such as tvs  and revenue from new products which began shipping in revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over million for the previous year 
this was due to higher unit shipments in for several new products introduced in and revenue from our dc to dc converter product family increased million  or  due to higher volume shipments resulting from increased order rates for existing and new products for shipments into the computer and consumer electronic communications markets 
revenue from our lcd backlight inverter product family increased million  or  due to higher volume shipments resulting from increased order rates for existing and new products

international revenue for the year ended december  was million or of net revenue  an increase of million as compared to international revenue of million  or of net revenue for the year ended december  for the year ended december   international revenue was million or of net revenue 
the increase in net revenue was due to higher volume shipments resulting from increased order rates for existing and new products 
our revenue from both direct sales and sales to third parties into asia were  and of net revenue for the years ended  and  respectively 
due primarily to increased sales of our dc to dc converter and lcd backlight inverter product families  we have experienced significant revenue growth in a relatively short period of time 
specifically  our annual revenue was million in  million in  and million in however  in the first quarter of  we began experiencing lower than expected shipment volumes beyond our typical first quarter seasonality for several reasons 
among other things  the ongoing litigation with o and the recent adverse jury verdicts in two cases have resulted in some lost revenue and orders 
in addition  certain of our distributors overestimated their own end customer demand and or underestimated their own inventory  as a result  ordered more of our products in the fourth quarter of than they needed to fulfill their end customers requirements 
accordingly  our shipments to these distributors in the first quarter of have been lower than expected 
as a result  we expect our operating results for the first quarter of fiscal to be adversely affected 
in addition  we are currently experiencing a lower order rate  or backlog  than expected 
you should not rely on results of any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance 
for the year ended december   our led drivers products have been combined into our dc to dc converter product family

gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to volume efficiencies attributable to growth in unit shipments in all our product families 
in addition  stock based compensation decreased from million or of revenue in to million or of revenue  in inventory reserves increased million in as compared to primarily related to provisions made for obsolescence and excess inventories 
inventory reserves represented of revenue in provisions for warranty expense increased million and were of revenue in due to a change during the third quarter of in our product warranty period from days to one year 
during the fourth quarter of our gross profit was adversely impacted by million of startup expenses for our chengdu testing facility 
we expect our gross margin in the first half of fiscal to be adversely impacted by startup expenses for the chengdu testing facility and reduced efficiencies attributable to lower shipment volumes

stock based compensation allocated to research and development expenses was million  or of revenue  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation of million was primarily due to the lower rate of amortization when applying the multiple award option approach 
under this approach  the stock based compensation expense is substantially higher in the year the option is granted and decreases each year thereafter 
moreover  stock options granted to employees during the current year were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value  which resulted in no stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  as compared to million  or of revenue for the year ended december  research and development expenses  excluding stock based compensation  were million  or of revenue for the year ended december  and million  or of revenue for the year ended december  the increase of million was due to an increase in personnel and expenses associated with new product development activities 
stock based compensation allocated to research and development expenses were million  or of revenue for the year ended december  and million  or of revenue for the year ended december  stock based compensation allocated to research and development expenses increased in the year ended december  due to option and restricted stock grants made to employees with exercise prices less than fair market value in we believe that investments in research and development  including the recruiting and hiring of design engineers  are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products 
we will continue to focus on long term opportunities available in our end markets and make significant investments in the development of new products related to these end markets 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase for this reason as well as for the adoption of sfas r in

stock based compensation allocated to selling  general and administrative expenses was million  or of revenue  for the year ended december   compared to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the lower rate of amortization in this period from the use of the multiple award option approach for the computation of our stock based compensation expense 
under this approach  the stock based compensation expense is substantially higher in the year the option is granted and decreases each year thereafter 
in addition  the termination of the employment of a highly compensated employee in also contributed to the decrease due to the reversal in of previously expensed stock compensation associated with cancelled unvested options 
stock options granted to employees during the current year were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value  which resulted in no stock based compensation expense 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of the company s adoption of sfas r and also may increase as a result of the company s ongoing efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act

for a more complete description of our litigation matters  please read item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to our inability to control events in our various litigations  it is difficult to predict trends in our patent litigation expenses 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  interest and other income is comprised primarily of interest earned on our cash and short term investments 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to the increase in our cash and short term investments  resulting from the million in proceeds of our initial public offering  net of expenses  received in november cash and cash equivalents are comprised of short term  highly liquid investments purchased with remaining maturities of three months or less  primarily interest bearing accounts
