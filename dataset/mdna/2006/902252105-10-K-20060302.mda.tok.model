overview we provide integrated information management solutions and services for local governments 
we develop and market a broad line of software products and services to address the information technology it needs of cities  counties  schools and other local government entities 
in addition  we provide professional it services to our customers  including software and hardware installation  data conversion  training and for certain customers  product modifications  along with continuing maintenance and support for customers using our systems 
we also provide property appraisal outsourcing services for taxing jurisdictions 
our products are generally grouped into four major areas financials  courts and justice  property appraisal and tax  and document management 
we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
these indicators include the following revenues we derive our revenues from four primary sources sale of software licenses  software services  appraisal services  and maintenance and support 
because we sell primarily off the shelf software  increased sales of software products generally result in incrementally higher gross margins 
thus  the most significant driver to our business is the number and size of software license sales 
in addition  new software license sales generally generate implementation services revenues as well as future maintenance and support revenues  which we view as a recurring revenue source 
we also monitor our customer base and churn since our maintenance and support revenue should increase due to our historically low customer turnover 
cost of revenues and gross margins our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation and appraisal services to our customers 
we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base  especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost  such as software licenses and maintenance and support 
our appraisal projects are seasonal in nature  and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short term basis to coincide with the life of a project 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the primary components of sg a expense are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions  marketing expense  research and development costs  rent and professional fees 
sales commissions generally fluctuate with revenues but other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues  however  these costs have recently grown disproportionately because of the requirements of corporate governance legislation 
research and development costs fluctuate from year to year depending on product development activity 

table of contents liquidity and cash flows the primary driver of our cash flows is net income 
in addition  cash flow was positively impacted when we sold our investment in hte  inc and received million in cash proceeds 
uses of cash include capital investments in software development and property and equipment and the discretionary purchases of treasury stock 
in  we purchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned 
balance sheet cash  accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues  cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to intangible assets  bad debts and our service contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants  and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on our appraisal services contracts using the proportionate performance method of accounting  with considerations for the provisions of emerging issue task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our revenues are derived from sale of software licenses  appraisal services  maintenance and support  and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non refundable claim 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
because most of our customers are governmental entities  we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments 
in a limited number of cases  we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service  and we may offer a concession to such customer 
in those limited situations where we grant a concession  we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee  but alternatively may perform additional services  such as additional training or programming a minor feature the customer had in their prior software solution 
these amounts have historically been considered nominal 
in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion  our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
also  management at our corporate offices as well as at our operating companies review  on at least a quarterly basis  significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision  include  but are not limited to  deterioration of a customer s financial condition  failure to manage our customer s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered  and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 
for those software arrangements that include customization of the software  which is considered essential to its functionality  and for substantially all real estate appraisal outsourcing projects  we recognize revenue and profit as the work progresses using the percentage of completion method and the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition 
these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs  as well as measures of progress toward completion 
we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  we perform additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy 
table of contents customer expectations 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 
we use contract accounting  primarily the percentage of completion method  for those software arrangements that include customization or modification of the software  or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software 
in addition  we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects  some of which can range up to three years 
in connection with these and certain other contracts  we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and or payable pursuant to the contract 
the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the fair value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 
in connection with certain of our contracts  we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date 
many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period 
management reviews unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
in addition  we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned 
this liability primarily consists of maintenance billings in which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period  generally one year 
we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met 
on a periodic basis  we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense  as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value  with the excess allocated to goodwill 
accordingly  we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets  including software  customer related intangibles  trade name and goodwill 
in addition  we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
certain of these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is generally measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value  generally determined by estimated future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of other intangible assets is generally measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used  or a significant adverse change in the business climate 
in addition  products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non competitive 

table of contents analysis of results of operations and other the following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a basis consistent with gaap for the years ended december   and these results include the results of the operations of eden from the date of its acquisition on december  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
compared to revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our revenues for the following years ended december of of vs 
in thousands total total software licenses software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
changes in software license revenues consist of the following components software license revenue related to financial products  which comprise approximately of our software license revenues in the years presented  increased slightly compared to the prior year primarily due to third party software products which enhance the functionality of our proprietary software 
our financial software products automate accounting systems for cities  counties  school districts  public utilities and not for profit organizations 
software license revenue related to our odyssey courts and justice product declined in compared to the prior year was unusually high because it included approximately  of license fees earned upon final acceptance for two original odyssey installation sites 
in we had fifteen odyssey contracts in process compared to seven odyssey contracts in the implementation cycle for odyssey products ranges from nine to thirty six months depending on the scope of the contract and modification complexity 
we have recognized revenue on these contracts using contract accounting 
software services 
changes in software services revenues consist of the following components software services revenue related to financial products  which comprise more than half of our software service revenue in the years presented  increased moderately in compared to the prior year 
typically  software contracts include services such as installing the software  converting the customers data to be compatible with the software and training customer personnel to use the software 
approximately one half of our financial software services revenue increase related to training and the remaining increases were due to new customers for our application service provider hosting and disaster recovery services and other miscellaneous services 
we increased our training staff in which enabled us to deliver our backlog at a faster rate 
software services revenue related to our odyssey courts and justice product increased significantly in compared to the prior year mainly due to a new million contract for follow on services to an existing customer that had previously implemented and accepted the software 
software services revenue related to appraisal and tax products declined substantially in this decline was mainly associated with the completion of several legacy appraisal and tax contracts in and early 
table of contents maintenance 
we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and third party software 
maintenance revenues increased due to growth in our installed customer base as evidenced by our software license revenue and slightly higher maintenance rates on certain product lines 
appraisal services 
the decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to the completion in of certain significant appraisal contracts 
these larger projects are often relatively discretionary in nature compared to smaller projects which tend to occur on a more consistent basis  and the larger projects we recently completed have not been replaced by similar projects 
the appraisal services business is driven in part by revaluation cycles in various states and based on our new business pipeline  we expect that appraisal services revenues in the foreseeable future will remain at historically low levels consistent with cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and associated gross margins  and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related vs 
in thousands revenues revenues software licenses acquired software software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues overall gross margin cost of software license revenues 
the main component of our cost of software license revenues is amortization expense for capitalized development costs on certain software products  with third party software costs making up the balance 
once a new product is released  we begin to amortize the costs associated with its development 
amortization expense is determined on a product by product basis at an annual rate not less than straight line basis over the product s estimated life  but not to exceed five years 
development costs consist mainly of personnel costs  such as salary and benefits paid to our developers 
amortization expense for capitalized software products declined from million in to million in  because certain software products became fully amortized during  which offset new amortization expense from software products released in cost of acquired software 
when we complete an acquisition we allocate the excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired to amortizable software  customer and trade name intangibles  with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization 
amortization expense of acquired software is recorded as cost of revenues while amortization expense of other acquisition intangibles is recorded as amortization of customer and trademark intangibles 
in cost of acquired software declined compared to the prior year because certain acquired software assets recorded for previous acquisitions became fully amortized 
the estimated useful life of acquired software ranges from to years 
estimated annual amortization expense relating to acquired software  excluding acquisitions completed in  for the next five years is as follows in thousands we have not finalized the allocation of the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets for the companies acquired in january  but expect this allocation will significantly increase related amortization expense over the next five years 
cost of software services and maintenance revenues 
cost of software services and maintenance revenues primarily consists of expenses such as personnel costs related to installation of our software products  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel  support activities and various other services such as application service provider asp and disaster recovery 
in 
table of contents cost of software services and maintenance grew while the related software services and maintenance revenues increased compared to the prior year period 
during  costs increased at a faster rate than related software services and maintenance revenues  which reflects lower utilization of personnel in our appraisal and tax software division  costs to support our recently released orion products  a shift in the roles of certain of our development personnel whose costs were capitalized in to projects that were expensed in  and higher health care costs 
cost of appraisal services revenues 
the decline in the cost of appraisal services revenues is the result of lower appraisal services revenues 
we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects whose term of employment generally ends with the projects completion 
in addition  in the second quarter of we made significant organizational changes to our appraisal services division because of the declining gross margins 
see restructuring charge 
gross margin 
the overall gross margin for was compared to in the margin decline was due to cost inefficiencies associated with lower appraisal services revenues and efforts and costs to support our recently released orion products  as well as a shift in the roles of certain of our development personnel whose costs were capitalized in to projects that are being expensed in and higher health care costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the following years ended december of of vs 
in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher health care costs and an increase in the number of marketing personnel 
these increases were offset somewhat by lower consulting fees associated with documenting our internal control processes 
restructuring charge because of unsatisfactory financial performance early in  we made significant organizational changes to those areas of our business that were not performing to our expectations 
our goal was to bring costs in line with expected levels of revenue while improving the efficiency of our organizational structure to ensure that clients continue to receive superior service 
we currently anticipate that revenues in our appraisal services business are likely to remain at historically low levels in the foreseeable future  consistent with and have reorganized that division to eliminate levels of management and reduce overhead expense 
we have also taken action to reduce headcount and costs in our appraisal and tax software division 
these cost reductions were made in the second quarter of as a result  we reduced headcount in the appraisal services and appraisal and tax software businesses  as well as in the corporate office  by eliminating approximately positions  including management  staff and project related personnel 
additionally we have made changes in both management personnel and organizational structures at those business units and have reorganized our corporate structure to consolidate certain senior management positions 
in connection with the reorganization  we incurred certain charges in the second quarter of those charges  which were primarily comprised of employee severance costs and related fringe benefits  totaled approximately million before income taxes 
the related payments were made during the second and third quarter in 
table of contents amortization of customer and trade name intangibles acquisition intangibles are composed of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired and amortizable software  customer and trade name intangibles with the remainder allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization 
however  amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as a non operating expense 
the estimated useful lives of customer and trade name intangibles are to years and to years  respectively 
the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the following years ended december vs 
in thousands amortization of customer and trade name intangibles estimated annual amortization expense relating to customer and trade name acquisition intangibles  excluding acquired software for which the amortization expense is recorded as cost of revenues and excluding acquisitions completed in  for the next five years is as follows in thousands other interest income is the main component of other income  which also includes non usage and other fees associated with our credit agreement  gain on sale of certain assets  gain on risk management assets associated with a foreign exchange contract and miscellaneous other items 
other income increased compared to mainly due to higher interest rates and a small gain on sale of certain assets 
income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december vs 
in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate declined from due to the qualified manufacturing activities deduction enacted in and a corporate reorganization in which favorably impacted our state income tax provision

in thousands total total software licenses software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total revenues software licenses 
for the year ended december   software license revenues included million related to eden systems  compared to  for the same prior year period 
excluding the software license revenue related to eden  the increase in software license revenues from to was approximately  or 
the change was the result of the following factors financials software license revenues  which comprise approximately two thirds of our software license revenues in the years presented excluding eden  increased million due to a combination of geographic expansion on the west coast and in the southwest united states  and an increase in our implementation staff  which has allowed us to install software products more quickly 
in addition  the completion in march of software enhancements to one of our financial software products has enabled us to expand into larger cities and counties  resulting in larger contracts 
courts and justice software license revenues decreased million compared to the prior year with approximately million of the decline due to lower revenues from odyssey courts and justice product 
in september  we successfully installed the first phase of odyssey in the state of minnesota and lee county  florida 
the contract with the state of minnesota was the largest software contract in our history  and we recorded million of software license revenue in for both minnesota and lee county 
in  we had seven odyssey contracts in process  several of which began late in the year 
we recognized revenue on these contracts using contract accounting and recorded approximately million of revenue for odyssey contracts in the remaining decline reflects lower sales of our legacy courts and justice products 
software services 
software services revenues increased million  or  compared to the prior year period after excluding the increase in software services revenues generated by eden of million 
higher software services revenues were attributable to the following factors excluding eden  software services revenues from our financials products comprised almost half of our software service revenue in the years presented and were million  or  higher in  primarily as a result of the increase in related software licenses sales over the prior year 
increased staffing levels also allowed for faster implementation of our backlog 
in addition  we expanded our asp and disaster recovery markets  which contributed approximately  to the increase in software services revenues related to appraisal and tax software products for the year ended december  were million higher than the prior year 
sales of orion  our new appraisal and tax product generated approximately million of the increase 
in  our document management division entered into a million contract to convert data into a microfilm format  which generated a  increase in software services revenue over the prior year 
maintenance 
maintenance revenues for the year ended december  included million from eden  compared to  for the same prior year period 
excluding the impact of eden  maintenance revenues during the year ended december  
table of contents increased approximately compared to due to growth in our installed customer base and slightly higher maintenance rates on certain product lines 
appraisal services 
the decrease in appraisal services revenues is due to the completion of certain significant appraisal contracts  particularly the completion of our contract with lake county  indiana in the fourth quarter of cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues and associated gross margins  and those components stated as a percentage of related revenues for the following years ended december of of related related vs 
in thousands revenues revenues software licenses acquired software software services maintenance appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues overall gross margin cost of software license revenues 
the increase is related to the general release of several software development products and the commencement of the related amortization expense 
product releases in include orion appraisal and tax products and an enhancement to one of our financial products 
amortization expense for also includes a full year of expense related to the odyssey courts and justice product versus only four months in cost of acquired software 
in cost of acquired software declined compared to because certain acquired software assets recorded for previous acquisitions became fully amortized beginning mid and throughout this decline was offset somewhat by the amortization expense for acquisition software recorded for the acquisition of eden in december cost of software services and maintenance revenues 
during the year ended december   eden contributed cost of software services and maintenance revenues of million  compared to  in the prior year 
excluding eden  cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased million  or  during in we added additional staff to provide faster implementation of our backlog 
excluding eden  software services and maintenance revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to cost of software services and maintenance revenues increased more than the associated revenues due to the time required to train and orient additional personnel hired during before they can effectively perform revenue generating tasks  such as training and implementations 
in addition  expenses increased as the costs related to certain employees who previously worked on new software development products ceased to be capitalized as those projects were completed and these employees moved into implementation and support functions 
cost of appraisal services revenues 
the decline in the cost of appraisal services revenues is consistent with lower appraisal services revenues 
in  appraisal revenues declined at a faster rate than cost of appraisal revenues due to the use of subcontractors to supplement our appraisal staff on some of our larger contracts during  resulting in lower margins 
the nature and timing of these contracts required us to retain staff on either short notice or with specific qualifications  thus increasing the associated costs as a percentage of appraisal revenues 
gross margin 
excluding the results of eden  our gross margin for was compared to in the prior year 
the decline in gross margin from the prior year period was due to the following factors higher amortization costs of our software development products released from mid year through  and the utilization of sub contractors by our property appraisal and tax and document management divisions during 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the following years ended december of of vs 
in thousands revenues revenues selling  general and administrative expenses sg a associated with eden amounted to million in compared to  in excluding eden  sg a increased year over year 
the increase in sg a is a result of the following factors costs to comply with corporate governance and public disclosure requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and new york stock exchange rules  including those associated with documenting and testing internal controls 
compliance costs were very high and significantly exceeded our original estimates 
these costs consisted of the engagement of a third party firm to consult with us on the development and testing of our controls  as well as the incremental costs associated with the independent auditors attesting to the effectiveness of these controls 
while some of the expenses we incurred in may be considered one time costs  it is clear that the new regulatory environment places an expensive burden on companies that will continue into the future  increased headcount in our sales and marketing areas to support geographic expansion  higher commissions related to higher revenue levels  and higher research and development costs 
amortization of customer and trade name intangibles amortization of customer and trade name intangibles increased in because it included a full year of amortization expense related to the december acquisition of eden 
realized gain on sale of investment in hte  inc on march   we received cash proceeds of million in connection with a transaction to sell all of our million shares of hte  inc hte common stock to sungard data systems inc for cash per share 
our original cost basis in the hte shares was million 
after transaction and other costs  we recorded a gross realized gain of million million or per diluted share after income taxes of million for the year ended december  income tax provision the following table sets forth a comparison of our income tax provision for the following years ended december vs 
in thousands income tax provision effective income tax rate the effective income tax rates for the periods presented were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of primarily due to the utilization of the capital loss carryforward in  increased state income taxes and non deductible meals and entertainment costs 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  includes income tax expense of million relating to the realized gain from the sale of our investment in hte after reduction in valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward amounting to million on a tax effected basis 
for  we had an effective income tax rate of excluding the effect of the hte gain compared to in the majority of the increase was due to higher state income taxes because in we had more sales and profitability in highly taxed states than in the prior year 

table of contents discontinued operations one of our non operating subsidiaries  swan transportation company swan  had been involved in various claims raised by former employees of a foundry that was owned by an affiliate of swan and tyler prior to december these claims were for alleged work related injuries and physical conditions resulting from alleged exposure to silica  asbestos  and or related industrial dusts 
after a series of bankruptcy court filings involving swan  on december   tyler in accordance with the terms of the plan of reorganization  transferred the stock of swan to the swan asbestos and silica trust the trust  an unaffiliated entity that will oversee the processing and payment of all present and future claims related to the foundry 
on december   we paid million to the trust in full and final release from all liability for claims associated with the once owned foundry the swan matter 
as a result of the release  any claimant is barred from asserting any such claim  either now or in the future  against tyler or its affected affiliates 
during the year ended december   the gain on disposal of discontinued operations of  primarily resulted because we fully settled the swan matter at an amount less than initially recorded and certain aspects of the settlement were structured in a beneficial tax manner 
accordingly  we recognized for the first time certain tax benefits associated with payments on behalf of the swan matter 
net income the following table sets forth a comparison of our net income  earnings per diluted share  income from continuing operations per diluted share and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the following years ended december vs

financial condition and liquidity historically  we have funded our operations and cash expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
as of december   our balance in cash and cash equivalents was million and we had short term investments of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at december  cash provided by operating activities was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in cash and short term investments increased primarily due to continued strong operating performance and higher deferred revenue due to additional maintenance customers and new contract signings 
at december   our days sales outstanding dsos were days compared to dsos of days at december  the increase in dsos is due primarily to timing of billings 
dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding long term receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by days 
investing activities provided cash of million in compared to a use of cash of million in and  in in we significantly reduced our capitalized investments in software development and property and equipment and liquidated some short term investments and reinvested the proceeds in cash equivalents 
the cash used in investing activities in was comprised of investments in software development costs and property and equipment  short term bond funds and additional purchase price payments related to the eden acquisition 
investing activities in included million of gross proceeds on the sale of our investment in hte  inc which was offset by the investment of such proceeds in short term bond funds  software development costs  property and equipment and the acquisition of eden

capital expenditures were funded from cash generated from operations 
proceeds from sales of short term investments were million during during  the short term investments earned interest income of  which was reinvested 
we also earned interest income of  from money market investments and interest income of  from an investment in a restricted certificate of deposit 
pursuant to our purchase agreement with eden  two of the shareholders of eden were granted the right to put their remaining shares to tyler and we were also granted the right to call the remaining shares

during  we received million for contributions to the tyler technologies  inc employee stock purchase plan the espp  which was adopted by our shareholders in may subsequent to december  and through february  we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
on february   we entered into a revolving bank credit agreement the credit facility 
the credit facility matures february  and provides for total borrowings of up to million and a million letter of credit facility under which the banks will issue cash collateralized letters of credit 
as of december   our effective interest rate was under the credit facility 
as of december  we had no debt and outstanding letters of credit totaling million to secure surety bonds required by some of our customer contracts 
as of february   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
in january  we acquired two companies  mazikusa  inc and tacs  inc 
the combined purchase price for the two companies was approximately million  comprised of approximately million cash and  shares of tyler common stock 
we have not finalized the allocation of the excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired companies but expect this allocation will result in non cash charges that will have a small dilutive effect on earnings per share in excluding acquisitions  we anticipate that capital spending will be between million and million  the majority of which will be related to computer equipment and software for infrastructure expansions 
capital spending in is expected to be funded from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations 
from time to time we will engage in discussions with potential acquisition candidates 
in order to pursue such opportunities  which could require significant commitments of capital  we may be required to incur debt or to issue additional potentially dilutive securities in the future 
no assurance can be given as to our future acquisition opportunities and how such opportunities will be financed 
in the absence of future acquisitions of other businesses  we believe our current cash balances and expected future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and other activities through the next twelve months 
if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our needs  we may borrow under our credit agreement 
we lease office facilities  as well as transportation  computer and other equipment used in our operations under non cancelable operating lease agreements expiring at various dates through most leases contain renewal options and some contain purchase options

r  share based payment which  among other things  will require the recording in the financial statements of non cash compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
prior to  we have only disclosed  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  pro forma financial results including the effects of share based compensation expense in the footnotes to the financial statements 
we have chosen the modified prospective method of implementing sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective method  new awards will be valued and accounted for prospectively upon adoption 
outstanding prior awards that are unvested as of december  will be recognized as compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period 
prior periods will not be restated 
based on stock options granted to employees through december   we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   will reduce first quarter net earnings by approximately  per share  diluted and reduce full year net earnings by approximately million per share  diluted 
sfas no 
r also requires employee stock purchase plans espp with purchase price discounts greater than to be compensatory 
our espp has a purchase price discount  but the plan can be modified at any time 
we expect the related compensatory charge would reduce first quarter net earnings by approximately  per share  diluted and reduce full year net earnings by approximately  per share  diluted 
sfas no 
r includes several modifications to the way that income taxes are recorded in the financial statements 
the expense for certain types of option grants is only deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place  which could cause variability in our effective tax rates recorded throughout the year 
sfas no 
r does not allow companies to predict when these taxable events will take place 
furthermore  it requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
however  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions  as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows  were   and  respectively  for   and see notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our stock based compensation plans

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these investments were treated as available for sale under sfas no 
the carrying value of these investments approximates fair market value 
due to the nature of this investment  we are not subject to significant market rate risk 
we have no outstanding debt at december   and we therefore are not subject to any interest rate risk 
in order to enhance our ability to manage foreign currency risk associated with one contract  in december  we contracted with a commercial bank to enter into a series of forward contracts  at no material cost to us  to acquire canadian dollars through at fixed prices 
these forward contracts have been entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposure in this contract and do not constitute positions independent of this exposure 
we had approximately  of current risk management assets associated with these foreign exchange contracts at december  if the applicable exchange rate was to increase or decrease 
table of contents from the rate at december   our current risk management assets would increase or decrease approximately  we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument
