item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
financial condition and liquidity summary 
our financial condition and liquidity depends on the cash flow from our three principal business segments and our subsidiaries that carry out those operations and borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
our cash flow is influenced mainly by the prices we receive for our natural gas production and  to a lesser extent  the prices we receive for our oil production  the quantity of natural gas and oil we produce  the demand for and the dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs  and the margins we obtain from our natural gas gathering and processing contracts 
our three principal business segments are contract drilling carried out by our subsidiaries unit drilling company  unit texas drilling  llc and service drilling southwest  llc  oil and natural gas exploration  carried out by our subsidiary unit petroleum company  and natural gas buying  selling  gathering and processing carried out by our subsidiary superior pipeline company  llc the following is a summary of certain financial information as of december  and for the years ended december  and percent change in thousands except percent amounts working capital long term debt shareholders equity ratio of long term debt to total capitalization net income net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities the following table summarizes certain operating information for the years ended december  and percent change oil production mbbls natural gas production mmcf average oil price received average oil price received excluding hedge average natural gas price received average natural gas price received excluding hedge average number of our drilling rigs in use during the period total number of drilling rigs available at the end of the period average dayrate gas gathered mmbtu day gas processed mmbtu day number of active natural gas gathering systems 
table of contents at december   we had unrestricted cash totaling million and we had borrowed million of the million we had elected to have available under our bank credit agreement 
our bank credit agreement 
on november   we entered into a second amendment to our credit agreement dated january  under the terms of the second amendment the lenders aggregate commitment was increased from million to million 
this credit agreement consists of a revolving credit facility maturing on january  borrowings under the credit facility are limited to the commitment amount and we have currently elected to have the full million available as the commitment amount 
we are charged a commitment fee of 
of on the amount available but not borrowed 
we incurred origination  agency and syndication fees of  at the inception of the agreement   of which will be paid annually and the remainder of the fees amortized over the life of the agreement 
during  we incurred additional origination  agency and syndication fees of  while amending the credit agreement and these fees are being amortized over the remaining life of the agreement 
the average interest rate for was 
at december  and february   our borrowings were million and million  respectively 
the borrowing base under our credit facility is subject to re determination on may and november of each year 
the latest re determination supported the full million 
each re determination is based primarily on the sum of a percentage of the discounted future value of our oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by the banks 
the determination of our borrowing base also includes an amount representing a small part of the value of our drilling rig fleet limited to million as well as such loan value as the lenders reasonably attribute to superior pipeline company s cash flow as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement allows for one requested special re determination of the borrowing base by either the banks or us between each scheduled re determination date 
at our election  any portion of the outstanding debt may be fixed at a london interbank offered rate libor for   or day terms 
during any libor rate funding period the outstanding principal balance of the note to which a libor rate option applies may be repaid after providing three days notice to the administrative agent and on the payment of any required indemnification amounts 
interest on the libor rate is computed at the libor base rate applicable for the interest period plus to depending on the level of debt as a percentage of the total loan value and is payable at the end of each term or every days whichever is less 
borrowings not under the libor rate bear interest at the jpmorgan chase prime rate payable at the end of each month and the principal borrowed may be paid anytime in part or in whole without premium or penalty 
at december   all of our million debt was subject to the libor rate 
the credit agreement includes prohibitions against the payment of dividends other than stock dividends during any fiscal year in excess of of our consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal year  the incurrence of additional debt with certain very limited exceptions and the creation or existence of mortgages or liens  other than those in the ordinary course of business  on any of our property  except in favor of our banks 
the credit agreement also requires that we have at the end of each quarter a consolidated net worth of at least million  a current ratio as defined in the credit agreement of not less than to and a leverage ratio of long term debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for the most recently ended rolling four fiscal quarters of no greater than to on december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit agreement 

table of contents in february  we entered into an interest rate swap to help manage our exposure to possible future interest rate increases 
the contract swaps million of variable rate debt to fixed and covers the period from march  through january this period coincides with the remaining length of our current credit agreement 
the fixed rate is based on three month libor and is at 
the swap is a cash flow hedge 
as a result of this interest rate swap  our interest expense was increased by million in the fair value of the swap was recognized on the december  balance sheet as current and non current derivative assets totaling million and a gain of million  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
contractual commitments 
at december   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands bank debt retirement agreement operating leases drill pipe  drilling rigs and equipment purchases serdrilco inc earn out agreement total contractual obligations see previous discussion in management discussion and analysis regarding our bank credit agreement 
this obligation is presented in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement and includes interest calculated at our year end interest rate of 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million in additional employee benefit expenses for the present value of a separation agreement made in connection with the retirement of king kirchner from his position as chief executive officer 
the liability associated with this expense  including accrued interest  will be paid in monthly payments of  starting in july and continuing through june in the first quarter of  we acquired a liability for the present value of a separation agreement between petrocorp incorporated and one of its previous officers 
the liability associated with this last agreement will be paid in quarterly payments of  through december  in the first quarter of  we recorded million in additional employee benefit expense for the present value of a separation agreement made in connection with the retirement of john nikkel from his position as chief executive officer 
the liability associated with this expense  including accrued interest  will be paid in monthly payments of  starting in november and continuing through october these liabilities  as presented above  are undiscounted 
we lease office space in tulsa and woodward  oklahoma  houston  midland and weatherford  texas  pinedale  wyoming and denver  colorado under the terms of operating leases expiring through january  additionally  we have several equipment leases and lease space on short term commitments to stack excess drilling rig equipment and production inventory 
due to the potential for limited availability of new drill pipe within the industry  we have committed to purchase approximately million of drill pipe and drill collars 
we have committed to purchase million of additional drilling rig components for the construction of new drilling rigs with million of that amount paid before december  we have also committed million for the purchase of two new drilling rigs with million paid before december  and the remainder due at delivery 
the first of these new drilling rigs should be operational by april and the second drilling rig is expected to be placed into operation in may on december   the company acquired serdrilco incorporated and its subsidiary  service drilling southwest  llc  for million in cash 
the terms of the acquisition include an earn out provision 
table of contents allowing the sellers to receive one half of the cash flow in excess of million for each of the three years following the acquisition 
for the year ending december   the second year of the earn out period  the drilling rigs included in the earn out provision had cash flow providing an earn out of approximately million 
to help assure the availability of casing and tubing for the wells planned in our development drilling program  in the first quarter of  our oil and natural gas segment made a commitment to purchase million of tubing and casing for delivery during the first six months of at december   we also had the following commitments and contingencies that could create  increase or accelerate our liabilities estimated amount of commitment expiration per period other commitments total accrued less than year years years after years in thousands deferred compensation agreement  unknown unknown unknown unknown separation benefit agreement  unknown unknown unknown plugging liability gas balancing liability  unknown unknown unknown unknown repurchase obligations unknown unknown unknown unknown workers compensation liability we provide a salary deferral plan which allows participants to defer the recognition of salary for income tax purposes until actual distribution of benefits  which occurs at either termination of employment  death or certain defined unforeseeable emergency hardships 
we recognize payroll expense and record a liability  included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  at the time of deferral 
effective january   we adopted a separation benefit plan separation plan 
the separation plan allows eligible employees whose employment with us is involuntarily terminated or  in the case of an employee who has completed years of service  voluntarily or involuntarily terminated  to receive benefits equivalent to four weeks salary for every whole year of service completed with us up to a maximum of weeks 
to receive payments the recipient must waive any claims against us in exchange for receiving the separation benefits 
on october   we adopted a separation benefit plan for senior management senior plan 
the senior plan provides certain officers and key executives of unit with benefits generally equivalent to the separation plan 
the compensation committee of the board of directors has absolute discretion in the selection of the individuals covered in this plan 
on may   we also adopted the special separation benefit plan 
this plan is identical to the separation benefit plan with the exception that a participant will vest in his or her earned benefit on the earliest of the participant reaching the age of or serving years with us 
as of december   there were no participants in this plan  however in january  the compensation committee elected to allow employees to participate in the plan 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets mainly plugging and abandonment costs for our depleted wells in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled or acquired 
we have recorded a liability for those properties we believe do not have sufficient oil and natural gas reserves to allow the under produced owners to recover their under production from future production volumes 
we formed the unit oil and gas limited partnership and the energy income limited partnership along with private limited partnerships the partnerships with certain qualified employees  officers and directors from through  with a subsidiary of ours serving as general partner 
the partnerships were formed for the purpose of conducting oil and natural gas acquisition  drilling and development operations and serving as co general partner with us in any additional limited partnerships 
table of contents formed during that year 
the partnerships participated on a proportionate basis with us in most drilling operations and most producing property acquisitions commenced by us for our own account during the period from the formation of the partnership through december of that year 
these partnership agreements require  on the election of a limited partner  that we repurchase the limited partner s interest at amounts to be determined in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement in the future 
any repurchases in any one year are limited to of the outstanding units 
we made repurchases of   and  in  and  respectively 
we have recorded a liability for future estimated payments related to workers compensation claims 
these claims are incurred primarily in our contract drilling segment 
hedging 
periodically we hedge the prices we will receive for a portion of our future natural gas and oil production 
we do so in an attempt to reduce the impact and uncertainty that price variations have on our cash flow 
during the first quarter of  we entered into the following two natural gas collar contracts first contract production volume covered  mmbtus day period covered april through september of prices floor of and a ceiling of second contract production volume covered  mmbtus day period covered april through september of prices floor of and a ceiling of during the first quarter of  we also entered into the following two oil collar contracts first contract production volume covered  barrels month period covered may through december of prices floor of and a ceiling of second contract production volume covered  barrels month period covered may through december of prices floor of and a ceiling of all of these hedges were cash flow hedges and there was no material amount of ineffectiveness 
the natural gas collar contracts decreased our natural gas revenues by  oil revenues were decreased by  in due to the settlement of the oil hedge 
we did not have any hedging transactions outstanding at december  during the first and second quarters of  we entered into the following two natural gas collar contracts first contract production volume covered  mmbtus day period covered april through october of prices floor of and a ceiling of second contract production volume covered  mmbtus day period covered may through october of prices floor of and a ceiling of 
table of contents we also entered into an oil hedge covering  barrels of oil production per day 
this transaction covered the period of february through december of and had an average price of 
all of these hedges were cash flow hedges and there was no material amount of ineffectiveness 
the natural gas collar contracts increased our natural gas revenues by  oil revenues were reduced by million in due to the settlement of the oil hedge 
we did not have any hedging transactions outstanding at december  in january  we entered into the following two natural gas collar contracts 
first contract production volume covered  mmbtus day period covered april through october of prices floor of and a ceiling of second contract production volume covered  mmbtus day period covered april through october of prices floor of and a ceiling of in march  we also entered into an oil collar contract covering  barrels of oil production per day 
this transaction covered the period of april through december of  and had a floor of and a ceiling of all of these hedges are cash flow hedges and there is no material amount of ineffectiveness 
the natural gas collar contracts decreased our natural gas revenues by million 
we did not have any oil or natural gas hedging transactions outstanding at december  in february  we entered into an interest rate swap to help manage our exposure to possible future interest rate increases 
this contract swaps million of variable rate debt to fixed and covers the period from march  through january  this period coincides with the remaining term of our current credit agreement 
the fixed rate is based on three month libor and is at 
this swap is a cash flow hedge 
as a result of this interest rate swap  our interest expense was increased by million in the the fair value of the swap was recognized on the december  balance sheet as current and non current derivative assets totaling million and a gain of million  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  property damage  control of well and employee medical benefits 
in addition  our insurance policies contain deductibles or retentions per occurrence that range from million for oklahoma workers compensation to million for general liability and drilling rig physical damage 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent feasible  our per occurrence and aggregate exposure to certain types of claims 
however  there is no assurance that the insurance coverage we have will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
if our insurance coverage becomes more expensive  we may choose to decrease our limits and increase our deductibles rather than pay higher premiums 
following the acquisition of serdrilco and the creation of unit texas drilling  llc we have elected to use an erisa governed occupational injury benefit plan to cover the field and support staff for the rigs they operate in lieu of covering them under an insured texas workers compensation plan 
impact of prices for our oil and natural gas 
natural gas comprised of our oil and natural gas reserves 
any significant change in natural gas prices has a material affect on our revenues  cash flow and the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
generally  prices and demand for domestic natural gas are influenced by weather conditions  supply imbalances and by world wide oil price levels 
domestic oil prices are primarily influenced by world oil market developments 
all of these factors are beyond our control and we can not predict nor measure their future influence on the prices we will receive 

table of contents based on our production in  a per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production would result in a corresponding  per month million annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
our average natural gas price was compared to an average natural gas price of for a per barrel change in our oil price would have an  per month million annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow based on our production in our average oil price was compared with an average oil price of received in because natural gas prices have such a significant affect on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves  declines in these prices can result in a decline in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
price declines can also adversely affect the semi annual determination of the amount available for us to borrow under our bank credit agreement since that determination is based mainly on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
such a reduction could limit our ability to carry out our planned capital projects 
most of our natural gas production is sold to third parties under month to month contracts 
for  purchases by eagle energy partners i  lp eagle s accounted for approximately of our oil and natural gas revenues 
on august   we completed the sale of our limited partner interest in eagle energy partners i  lp eagle s purchase of natural gas from us during accounted for of our oil and natural gas revenues during eagle also marketed approximately of the natural gas volumes we sold for ourselves as well as third parties during the same period 
for the period august through december  eagle s purchases from us accounted for of our oil and natural gas revenues and it marketed approximately of the natural gas volumes we sold for ourselves as well as third parties during the same five month period 
oil and natural gas acquisitions and capital expenditures 
on june   we completed the acquisition of certain oil and natural gas properties from a private company for an adjusted cash purchase price of million 
this acquisition consisted of approximately bcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves and several probable locations 
the properties are located in oklahoma and produced mmcfe per day at the time of acquisition 
the effective date of this acquisition was april  the results of operations for these acquired properties are included in the statement of income beginning june   with the results for the period from april  through may  included as part of the adjusted purchase price 
on november   we completed the acquisition of certain oil and natural gas properties from a group of private entities for an adjusted cash purchase price of million 
this acquisition consisted of approximately bcfe of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
the properties are located in oklahoma  arkansas and texas and at the time of the acquisition produced mmcfe per day 
the effective date of this acquisition was july  the results of operations for the acquired properties are included in the statement of income beginning november   with the results for the period from july  through october  included as part of the adjusted purchase price 
most of our capital expenditures are discretionary and directed toward future growth 
our decision to increase our oil and natural gas reserves through acquisitions or through drilling depends on the prevailing or expected market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and opportunities to obtain financing under the circumstances involved  all of which provide us with a large degree of flexibility in deciding when to incur these costs 
we drilled wells net wells in compared to wells net wells in our capital expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration and acquisitions in totaled million with million relating to the june  and november  acquisitions discussed above 
as a result of these two acquisitions  we recorded a plugging liability and deferred tax liability of million 
based on current prices  we plan to drill an estimated wells in we estimate that our capital expenditures associated with our oil and natural gas exploration and acquisitions activities will be approximately million 
in the first quarter of  we made commitments to purchase million of casing and tubing for delivery during the first six months of 
table of contents contract drilling 
our drilling work is subject to many factors that influence the number of drilling rigs we have working as well as the costs and revenues associated with that work 
these factors include the demand for drilling rigs  competition from other drilling contractors  the prevailing prices for natural gas and oil  availability and cost of labor to run our drilling rigs and our ability to supply the equipment needed 
because of the current high demand for drilling rigs we are experiencing difficulty in hiring and keeping all of the drilling rig crews we need 
in response to our labor difficulties  we increased wages in some of our drilling areas and implemented longevity pay incentives at the end of the first and fourth quarters of at the end of the second quarter of  we increased wages in our other drilling areas that had not received increases in the fourth quarter on to date  these efforts have allowed us to meet our labor requirements 
however  current demand for drilling rigs continues  shortages of experienced personnel may limit our ability to operate our drilling rigs at or above the utilization rate we achieved in we currently do not have any shortages of drill pipe and drilling equipment 
because of the potential for future shortages in the availability of new drill pipe  at december   we had commitments to purchase approximately million of drill pipe and drill collars in we have committed to purchase million of additional drilling rig components which we will use to build new drilling rigs 
of that amount  million was paid before december  we have also committed million for the purchase of two new drilling rigs with million of that amount paid before december   and the balance to be paid on delivery 
the first of these drilling rigs should be operational by april  and the second drilling rig is expected to be placed into operation in may most of our drilling rig fleet is used to drill natural gas wells so changes in natural gas prices have a disproportionate influence on the demand for our drilling rigs as well as the prices we can charge for our contract drilling services 
in january  the average dayrate for the drilling rigs we then owned was  per day with a utilization rate 
in december  our average dayrate for the drilling rigs that we then owned was  with a utilization rate 
in  our average dayrate was  per day compared to  per day in the average number of our drilling rigs used in was drilling rigs compared with drilling rigs for based on the average utilization of our drilling rigs during  a per day change in dayrates has a  per day million annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
we expect that utilization and dayrates for our drilling rigs will continue to depend mainly on the price of natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs to meet the demands of the industry 
our contract drilling subsidiaries provide drilling services for our exploration and production subsidiary 
the contracts for these services contain the same terms and rates as the contracts we use with unrelated third parties for comparable type projects 
during and  we drilled and wells  respectively  for our exploration and production subsidiary 
the profit received by our contract drilling segment of million and million during and  respectively  was used to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties rather than being included in our operating profit 
drilling acquisitions and capital expenditures 
on august   we completed our acquisition of all of the texas drilling operations of texas wyoming drilling  inc  a texas based privately owned company  with the exception of one drilling rig which we subsequently acquired on october  the purchase price for this acquisition was million 
of that amount  million was paid in cash and million was issued in stock  representing  shares  on august  the remaining million was paid in cash on october  six of the drilling rigs are active in the barnett shale area of north texas 
of the seven drilling rigs are mechanical  and one is a diesel electric drilling rig 
they range from to  horsepower 
the results of operations for the six drilling rigs we acquired are included in the statement of income for the period after august   and the results of operations for the seventh drilling rig is included in the statement of income for the period after october  
table of contents on january   we acquired a subsidiary of strata drilling  llc for million 
in this acquisition  we acquired two drilling rigs as well as spare parts  inventory  drill pipe  and other major drilling rig components 
these two drilling rigs are both  horsepower  diesel electric drilling rigs with the capacity to drill  to  feet 
after receiving refurbishments costing million and million  respectively  the first drilling rig was placed in service in january and the second drilling rig was placed in service in august of both of these drilling rigs are in our rocky mountain division 
the results of operations for this acquired company are included in the statement of income for the period after january  in january  we completed the construction of a  horsepower diesel electric drilling rig which began operating in the anadarko basin 
the drilling rig was constructed for approximately million with the majority of the expenditures occurring in in may  we complete the construction of a  horsepower diesel electric drilling rig which began operating in the rocky mountain division 
this drilling rig was constructed for million with million of the parts acquired in the strata acquisition 
in december  we completed the construction of a  horsepower diesel electric drilling rig which began operating in the anadarko basin 
the drilling rig was constructed for approximately million 
in january  one of our drilling rigs was destroyed by a fire 
drilling rig no 
 a horsepower drilling rig and one of our smaller drilling rigs  experienced a blow out during initial drilling operations at an approximate depth of feet 
no personnel were injured although the drilling rig was a total loss 
we anticipate that part of this loss will be covered by insurance and we do not expect to incur a loss for financial statement purposes as a result of this event 
we expect to replace the destroyed drilling rig with a  horsepower drilling rig we acquired in january for approximately million 
this newly acquired drilling rig is currently undergoing modifications at one of our drilling yards and should be operational in march the addition of the drilling rigs in  combined with the loss of the one drilling rig in january  brings our total drilling rig fleet to as of february  the replacement drilling rig for the one we lost as a result of the fire  our th drilling rig  should be ready for operation in march we have also ordered two new drilling rigs 
we made a million down payment on these two drilling rigs before december  and the balance of the total purchase price of million will be paid when the drilling rigs are delivered 
the first of these drilling rigs should be operational by mid march and the second drilling rig is expected to be placed into operation in april we are also constructing two additional  horsepower scr drilling rigs 
the first of these drilling rigs should be completed and operational in april  and the second in june for our contract drilling operations during  we incurred million in capital expenditures  which includes million in connection with the drilling rigs acquired or built in and million of additional goodwill from the second year of the serdrilco acquisition earn out 
for  we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for our contract drilling operations which includes plans to add at least drilling rigs during  including the five drilling rigs previously discussed 
acquisition of natural gas gathering and processing company 
in july  we acquired the of superior pipeline company  llc that we did not already own 
we paid million in this acquisition 
before july  we owned gathering systems which have been consolidated with superior s systems 
superior is a mid stream company engaged primarily in the buying and selling  gathering  processing and treating of natural gas and operates two natural gas treatment plants  five processing plants  active gathering systems and miles of pipeline 
superior operates in oklahoma  texas and louisiana 
it has been in business since this acquisition and consolidation will increase our ability to gather and market our natural gas as well as third party natural gas and construct or acquire existing natural gas gathering and processing facilities 
before this acquisition  our interest in the operations of superior was shown as equity in earnings of unconsolidated investments 
the results of operations for this acquired company are included in the statement of income for the period after july  and intercompany revenue from services and purchases of production 
table of contents between business segments has been eliminated 
during  superior purchased million of our natural gas production and paid  for our natural gas liquids 
after the acquisition of superior  million of the natural gas purchased and  of the natural gas liquids purchased were eliminated in in  million of the natural gas purchased and  of the natural gas liquids purchased were eliminated 
during  we had capital expenditures for our natural gas gathering and processing operation of million 
for the year  we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million with the focus on growing this segment through the construction of new facilities or acquisitions 
oil and natural gas limited partnerships and other entity relationships 
we are the general partner of oil and natural gas partnerships which were formed privately or publicly 
each partnership s revenues and costs are shared under formulas set out in that partnership s agreement 
the partnerships repay us for contract drilling  well supervision and general and administrative expense 
related party transactions for contract drilling and well supervision fees are the related party s share of such costs 
these costs are billed on the same basis as billings to unrelated third parties for similar services 
general and administrative reimbursements consist of direct general and administrative expense incurred on the related party s behalf as well as indirect expenses assigned to the related parties 
allocations are based on the related party s level of activity and are considered by us to be reasonable 
during  and  the total we received for all of these fees was million  million and million  respectively 
we expect that these fees for will be comparable to those in our proportionate share of assets  liabilities and net income relating to the oil and natural gas partnerships is included in our consolidated financial statements 
on august   we completed the sale of our investment in eagle energy partners i  lp for million 
in the third quarter of  a gain before income taxes of million was recognized in other revenues from this sale 
eagle marketed approximately of the natural gas volumes we sold for ourselves and other parties in critical accounting policies 
summary in this section  we identify those critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
in the following discussion we will attempt to explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  as well as the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists the critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies  and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies estimates or assumptions accounts affected full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties oil and natural gas reserves estimates and related present value of future net revenues valuation of unproved properties oil and gas properties accumulated dd a provision for dd a impairment of proved and unproved properties long term debt and interest expense 
table of contents accounting policies estimates or assumptions accounts affected accounting for asset retirement obligations for oil and gas properties cost estimates related to the plugging and abandonment of wells oil and gas properties accumulated dd a provision for dd a current and non current liabilities operating expense accounting for impairment of drilling property and equipment forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows drilling property and equipment accumulated depreciation provision for depreciation impairment of drilling property and equipment turnkey and footage drilling contracts estimates of costs to complete turnkey and footage contracts revenue and operating expense current assets and liabilities significant estimates and assumptions the determination and valuation of our oil and natural gas reserves is a very subjective process 
it entails estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the degree of accuracy of these estimates depends on a number of factors  including  the quality and availability of geological and engineering data  the precision of the interpretations of that data  and individual judgments based on experience and training 
each year  we hire an independent petroleum engineering firm to audit our internal evaluation of our oil and natural gas reserves 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of oil and natural gas reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table type of reserves nature of available data degree of accuracy proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least accurate proved developed non producing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more accurate proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most accurate assumptions as to future oil and natural gas prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are influenced by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable oil and natural gas reserves is greater than the projected revenues from the oil and natural gas reserves 
but more significantly  the estimated present value of the future cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that the pricing we use be tied to the price we received for our oil and natural gas on the last day of the reporting period 
this requirement can result in significant changes from period to period given the volatile nature of oil and natural gas prices 
for example  based on our year end oil and natural gas reserves  a decline in the oil price used to calculate our economically recoverable oil reserves will reduce our estimated oil reserves by  barrels and a decline in the price of natural gas used to calculate our natural gas reserves will reduce our estimated economically recoverable natural gas reserves by  mcf 
estimated future cash flows discounted at before income taxes would change by million 

table of contents we compute our provision for dd a on a units of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for our producing properties dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate x current period production oil and natural gas reserve estimates have a significant impact on our dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in the future  the dd a rate will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
based on our production level of  equivalent mcf  a change in the amount of our oil and natural gas reserves would change our dd a rate by per mcfe and would change pre tax income by million annually 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling 
the ceiling is defined as the sum of the present value using a discount rate of the estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves  based on period end oil and natural gas prices adjusted for any hedging  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties not included in the costs being amortized  less related income taxes 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are required to write down the excess amount 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down cannot be reversed 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have large downward revisions in our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low oil or natural gas prices  even if temporary  increases the chance of a ceiling test write down 
based on oil and natural gas prices on december  per mcf for natural gas and per barrel for oil  the unamortized cost of our oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the ceiling of our proved oil and natural gas reserves 
natural gas and oil prices remain erratic and any significant declines below prices used in the reserve evaluation could result in a ceiling test write down in the future 
we use the sales method for recording natural gas sales 
this method allows for the recognition of revenue  which may be more or less than our share of pro rata production from certain wells 
our policy is to expense our pro rata share of lease operating costs from all wells as incurred 
the expenses relating to the wells in which we have an imbalance are not material 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas established an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of assets having a long life 
in our case  when the reserves in each of our oil or gas wells deplete or otherwise become uneconomical  we are required to incur costs to plug and abandon the wells 
these costs under fas are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled or acquired 
we do not have any assets restricted for the purpose of settling these plugging liabilities 
our engineering staff uses historical experience to determine the estimated plugging costs taking into account the type of well either oil or natural gas  the depth of the well and physical location of the well to determine the estimated plugging costs 
since the implementation of this standard  we have not plugged enough wells to make additional determinations as to the accuracy of our estimates 
drilling equipment  transportation equipment  gas gathering and processing systems and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and enhancements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are 
table of contents expensed 
realization of the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that these carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset  including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if any asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in these estimates could cause us to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
an estimate of the impact to our earnings if other assumptions had been used is not practicable because of the significant number of assumptions that would be involved in the estimates 
in our contract drilling operations  because we do not bear the risk of completion of a well being drilled under a daywork contract we recognize revenues and expense generated under daywork contracts as the services are performed 
under footage and turnkey contracts  we bear the risk of completion of the well  so revenues and expenses are recognized when the well is substantially completed 
substantial completion is determined when the well bore reaches the depth specified in the contract 
the entire amount of a loss  if any  is recorded when the loss can be reasonably determined  however  any profit is recorded only at the time the well is finished 
the costs of drilling contracts uncompleted at the end of the reporting period which includes expenses incurred to date on footage or turnkey contracts are included in other current assets 
in  we completed one well under a footage contract and we did not drill any wells under turnkey contracts 
effects of inflation the effect of inflation in the oil and natural gas industry is primarily driven by the prices for oil and natural gas 
increases in these prices increase the demand for our contract drilling rigs and services 
this in turn affects the dayrates we can obtain for our contract drilling services 
before  the effect of inflation on our operations was minimal due to low inflation rates  relatively low natural gas and oil prices and moderate demand for our contract drilling services 
over the last five years natural gas and oil prices have been more volatile  and during periods of higher utilization we have experienced increases in labor costs as well as the costs of services to support our drilling rigs 
during this same period  when oil and natural gas prices did decline  labor rates did not come back down to the levels existing before the increases 
if natural gas prices increase substantially for a long period  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor will result in additional increases in our material and labor costs 
increases in dayrates for drilling rigs also increase the cost of our oil and natural gas properties 
with an overall increase in drilling activity throughout the industry  costs for goods and services related to both our exploration and production segment  and our natural gas gathering and processing segment have been increasing 
these conditions may limit our ability to realize increases in our operating profits 
how inflation will affect us in the future will depend on additional increases  if any  realized in our drilling rig rates  the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas and the rates we receive for gathering and processing natural gas 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued statement on financial accounting standards no

in june  the fasb issued financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which establishes new standards on accounting for changes in accounting principles 
under this new rule  all such changes must be accounted for by retrospective application to the financial statements of prior periods unless it is impracticable to do so 
fas completely replaces apb and fas  though it carries forward the guidance in those pronouncements with respect to accounting for changes in estimates  changes in the reporting entity  and the correction of errors 
fas is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted for changes and corrections made in years beginning after may the application of fas does not affect the transition provisions of any existing pronouncements  including those that are in the transition phase as of the effective date of fas we do not expect this statement to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in the prices for natural gas and oil and interest rates 
commodity price risk 
our major market risk exposure is in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
the prices we receive are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and market prices applicable to our natural gas production 
historically  the prices we received for our oil and natural gas production have fluctuated and we expect these prices to continue to fluctuate 
the price of oil and natural gas also affects both the demand for our drilling rigs and the amount we can charge for the use of our drilling rigs 
based on our production  a per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production would result in a corresponding  per month million annualized change in our pre tax cash flow 
a per barrel change in our oil price would have an  per month million annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
in an effort to try and reduce the impact of price fluctuations  over the past several years we have periodically used hedging strategies to hedge the price we will receive for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production 
a detailed explanation of those transactions has been included under hedging in the financial condition portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation included above 
interest rate risk 
our interest rate exposure relates to our long term debt  all of which bears interest at variable rates based on the jpmorgan chase prime rate or the libor rate 
at our election  borrowings under our credit agreement may be fixed at the libor rate for periods of up to days 
historically  we have not used any financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage our exposure to possible increases in interest rates 
however  in february  we entered into an interest rate swap to help manage our exposure to future interest rate volatility 
a detailed explanation of this transaction has been included under hedging in the financial condition portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation included above 
based on our average outstanding long term debt in  a increase in the floating rate would reduce our annual pre tax cash flow by approximately million
