item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our existing collaboration with roche will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into the first half of  although we may choose to obtain additional financing from time to time 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be 
table of contents kosan biosciences wrong 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors  including the following our ability to establish any new collaborations  our rights and obligations under any new collaboration agreements and our ability to generate revenues under any new collaborations  the extent to which clinical and other development activities are funded by our current collaborators  roche and the nci  the progress  success and costs of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates  any acceleration of our clinical development plans  our ability to maintain or extend our existing collaborations with roche and the nci  the progress  number and costs of our research programs  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property rights  any need to obtain licenses to additional patents or other intellectual property in order to use  import  manufacture  market or sell our product candidates  any need to expand our manufacturing capabilities  and expenses associated with any possible future litigation 
our workforce reduction announced in march may have an adverse impact on our ability to make significant progress on our clinical and research programs 
in march  we announced a workforce reduction of employees to reflect a realignment of our research priorities and corporate operations to support our clinical product candidates and pipeline opportunities 
workforce and expense reductions have resulted in a reduction in the scope of our research programs  and further reductions could result in the reduced scope of  and progress on  our clinical and research programs 
in addition  employees  whether or not directly affected by a reduction  may seek alternative employment 
although our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time of hire  the confidential nature of certain proprietary information may not be maintained in the course of any such future employment 
we may face litigation from former employees who were affected by the workforce reduction 
in addition  the implementation of expense reduction programs has resulted in  and may in the future result in  the diversion of efforts of our executive management team and other key employees  which could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to recruit and retain skilled employees and consultants  we may not be able to successfully operate our business 
retaining our current management and other employees and recruiting qualified scientific personnel to perform future research  manufacturing and development work  as well as key management personnel with expertise in clinical testing and finance  among other areas  will be critical to our success 
none of our employees have employment commitments for any fixed period of time and could leave our employment at will 
in the past  we have experienced turnover among our management  including the recent resignations of our former chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
in addition  in march  we experienced a restructuring that resulted in a workforce reduction 
we may have difficulty attracting required personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce and expense reductions  or otherwise 
competition is intense among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions for experienced scientists and other personnel  and we may not be able to retain or recruit sufficient skilled personnel on acceptable terms to allow us to pursue collaborations and develop our product candidates and research programs  which would likely have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our stock option plan will expire on june  regulations implemented by the nasdaq national market require stockholder approval for all stock option plans  and regulations implemented by the new york stock exchange prohibit nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions 
as a result of these regulations  we will not be able to grant stock options to employees after our stock option plan expires unless our stockholders approve a new plan 
if a new stock option plan is not approved  we may incur increased compensation costs  be required to change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could materially and adversely affect our business 
if our current collaborations are unsuccessful or if conflicts develop with our collaborators  our research and development efforts could be delayed  curtailed or terminated  our revenues could significantly decrease and our operations may be adversely affected 
we have a corporate research and commercialization collaboration with roche in the field of epothilones 
we also have collaborations with  or have licenses to technology and compounds from  several research groups  including sloan kettering in the field of epothilones  the nci in the field of geldanamycin analogs and stanford university in the field of polyketide technology 
the agreements permit our collaborators or licensors to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances 
our collaboration agreements with the nci are currently set to expire in october we may not be able to maintain or extend these collaborations or license agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not maintain  extend or replace our corporate collaboration with roche  our research and development efforts could be delayed  our revenues would significantly decrease and our operations could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to maintain our research collaborations  including our collaboration agreements with the nci  or if our license agreements are terminated  our research and development efforts could be delayed  curtailed or terminated or we could lose our rights to use the licensed technology and compounds 
we control neither the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators devote to our programs or potential products  nor the scope  content and timing of the efforts that they conduct or permit under the collaborations 
as a result  we do not know if our collaborators will dedicate sufficient resources or if the development or commercialization efforts by our corporate partners will be successful 
we also do not know if the development or commercialization efforts by our collaborators will be the same as those we would choose to devote if we solely controlled the development and commercialization of our programs and product candidates 
in particular  in our collaboration with roche  we do not control the amount and timing of resources that roche devotes to the epothilone program beyond limited funding for certain kosan activities specified under the contract  and we do not control the scope  content and timing of the preclinical studies  clinical trials and other development efforts that roche conducts or permits under the program 
for example  we anticipate that roche will pursue late stage clinical development of only one of our epothilone product candidates  if any 
we anticipate that roche will make a decision in this regard in roche may elect to cease development of kos  our lead epothilone compound  in favor of further development of kos  which is currently in phase i clinical trials 
in our collaboration with the nci  we do not control the selection  conduct  timing and resources provided to clinical trials of geldanamycin analogs sponsored by the nci 
for these reasons  we may choose to undertake product development efforts that are within the scope of our collaborations at our own expense 
we also do not know whether our current collaborative partners or future collaborative partners  if any  might pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors  as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by collaborative arrangements with us 
in addition  business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator s business strategy may adversely affect a collaborator s willingness or ability to continue the collaboration with us 

table of contents kosan biosciences failure by our corporate partners to develop or commercialize a compound or product for which they have rights from us could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  if roche does not successfully develop and commercialize a product from our epothilone program  we may not receive any future milestone payments and will not receive any royalties under our collaboration with roche 
if our collaborators fail to conduct the collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner or if they or our licensors breach or terminate their agreements with us  the development or commercialization of the affected product candidates  technology or research program could be delayed or terminated 
if any of our existing collaboration agreements are terminated  we may be required to seek new collaborators or to undertake product development and commercialization at our own expense 
this may limit the number of product candidates we will be able to develop and commercialize  significantly increase our capital requirements and reduce the likelihood of successful product introduction 
disputes might also arise with collaborators or licensors concerning rights to particular compounds or technologies 
if we are unable to resolve these disputes in our favor  we could lose our rights to use those compounds or technologies 
if we fail to enter into new collaborative agreements in the future  our business and operations would be negatively impacted 
our strategy depends upon the formation and sustainability of multiple collaborative arrangements and license agreements with third parties 
we expect to rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources  but also for expertise that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and for license and technology rights 
although we have established collaborative arrangements and various license agreements  we do not know if we will be able to establish additional arrangements on favorable terms  or whether current or any future collaborative arrangements will ultimately be successful 
there have been  and may continue to be  a significant number of business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted  and may continue to result  in a reduced number of potential future corporate collaborators  which may limit our ability to find partners who will work with us in developing and commercializing our drug candidates 
if we do not enter into new collaborative agreements  we may be required to curtail  suspend or terminate research and development programs and therefore our ability to generate revenues from these programs will be adversely affected 
our ability to start new research and development programs may also be materially harmed 
our potential products are in an early stage of development  and substantial additional effort and expense will be necessary for development 
our drug candidates are in early stages of research and development 
we may not be able to develop products that prove to be safe and effective  meet applicable regulatory standards  are capable of being manufactured at reasonable costs or can be marketed successfully 
all of the potential products that we are currently developing will require significant development and investment  including extensive clinical testing  before we can submit any application for regulatory approval 
our products must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved by the fda and international regulatory authorities for commercial use 
we will need to conduct significant additional research and clinical trials before we can determine if our products are sufficiently safe and effective to file with the fda and other regulatory agencies for product approval 
clinical trials are expensive  and therefore  significant amounts of money will need to be spent testing our products 
in addition  significant time and investment will be required to try to develop manufacturing processes for our products so that they are economical to manufacture on a commercial scale and satisfactory to the fda and other governmental authorities 

table of contents the progress and results of our animal and human testing are highly uncertain 
we must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities with clinical data that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products before they can be approved for commercial sale 
as a result  commercialization of our product candidates depends upon successful completion of preclinical and clinical trials 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
it may take us a number of years to complete our testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
for example  in october  we discontinued a phase ii clinical study of kos in hormone refractory prostate cancer because the study did not meet the primary objective of tumor marker response in the first stage of a two stage clinical trial  and we previously discontinued clinical studies of kos in patients with non small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer 
we could experience similar failures in other current or future clinical testing of our product candidates 
success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful  and interim results of trials do not necessarily predict final results 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  including kosan  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
also  preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent further testing or regulatory approval 
we do not know whether clinical trials of our product candidates including ongoing and anticipated clinical trials of kos  kos  kos  kos  kos or other product candidates will begin on time or whether any of our clinical trials will be completed on schedule  or at all 
we also do not know whether clinical trials will indicate that an earlier stage compound  such as kos or kos  will be more appropriate for commercial development than a related compound that is at a later stage of clinical development  such as kos or kos  respectively 
negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be suspended  repeated or terminated 
certain of the clinical trials of our product candidates are or may in the future be designed to include two stages  with the decision whether to proceed to the second stage dependent on results obtained in the first stage 
failure to achieve predetermined response rates as defined in the protocol may result in the decision not to proceed into the second stage of the trial 
we have multiple product candidates in human clinical trials for the treatment of cancer  kos  kos  kos and kos anticancer drugs frequently have a narrow therapeutic window between efficacy and toxicity 
if unacceptable toxicity is observed in a clinical trial  the trial may be terminated at an early stage 
for example  in june  we discontinued a phase ii clinical study of kos in colorectal cancer due to unanticipated cumulative drug toxicities in patients who had previously been treated with the cancer treatment oxaliplatin 
we also observed a higher incidence of adverse events resulting in patient withdrawal in our phase ii clinical study of kos in hormone refractory prostate cancer than in our phase ii non small cell lung cancer trial 
we cannot predict whether future trials of kos  or other compounds  will demonstrate toxicity issues or adverse events resulting in a significant patient withdrawal 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the drug candidate 
our clinical trials may be suspended at any time if we  our collaborators  the fda  or other regulatory authorities believe the patients participating in our studies are exposed to unacceptable health risks or that study protocols or patient informed consents should be amended to reflect additional health risks  additional testing procedures or other changes 
for example  in september  we temporarily suspended enrollment in our kos and kos clinical trials in connection with a request by the fda to amend the protocols and patient informed consents for those trials 
we provided amended protocols and informed consents for those clinical trials to the fda in response to certain of its requested changes  and we 
table of contents kosan biosciences resumed enrollment in the clinical trials 
while the fda has not agreed or objected to these changes  the fda may require further changes to these protocols and informed consents  which may have a material adverse effect on the timing of  and our ability to conduct  the kos and kos clinical trials 
our ability to commence or timely complete clinical trials may be adversely affected by many factors  including ineffectiveness of the study compound  or perceptions by physicians that the compound is not effective for a particular indication  inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of compound for use in clinical trials  a failure to obtain approval from the fda  other regulatory authorities or an investigational site s institutional review board to conduct a clinical trial  inability to reach agreement with a sufficient number of investigational sites to conduct a study  the number of patients required  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment or inability to recruit a sufficient number of patients  adverse medical events or the death of patients during a clinical trial  even if caused by the advanced status of their disease or medical problems that are not related to our product candidates  inconclusive or negative results from the clinical trial  competing clinical trials in the same or similar indication  third party clinical investigators failing to perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol  and other third party organizations not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner  and a decision by the fda or other governmental authorities to require suspension or modification of a clinical trial 
our product development costs will increase if we have delays in testing or approvals  if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned or if our clinical trials include more expensive testing or other procedures than planned 
if the delays are significant  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products will be harmed  and our ability to become profitable will be adversely affected 
if any clinical trials of our product candidates are not successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 
if we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired 
our product candidates and the activities associated with their development  manufacture and commercialization are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory agencies in the united states  and by comparable authorities in other countries 
our products may not be commercialized unless and until our collaborators or we obtain regulatory approval from the fda or foreign governmental authorities to do so 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive  often takes many years  if approval is obtained at all  and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty  safety and efficacy of the product candidates involved 
we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction and  although our personnel have experience from working at other companies  we as a company have no experience in preparing and filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals to commercialize our products 
this lack of experience may impede our ability to obtain fda or other foreign regulatory approvals to commercialize our products in a timely manner  if at all 

table of contents changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period  changes in or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes  or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application  may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application for regulatory approval 
furthermore  the approval procedure and the time required to obtain approval varies among countries and can involve additional testing beyond that required by the fda 
approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions 
the fda and other regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical  clinical or other studies or modifications to the manufacturing processes or facilities or quality control procedures for our products 
any clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or other regulatory authorities 
for example  we currently conduct  and expect to conduct in the future  clinical trials for our product candidates in countries outside of the united states 
the fda or other regulatory authorities may reject data from clinical trials conducted in other countries if they are not conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and procedures 
we do not know whether clinical trials for our product candidates including ongoing and anticipated clinical trials of kos  kos  kos  kos or other product candidates will demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or will result in marketable products 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products under development will prevent receipt of fda and foreign approvals and  ultimately  commercialization of our products 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials  and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our products  and we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations  medical institutions and clinical investigators to perform this function 
we also rely on roche to conduct certain clinical trials for kos and potentially kos and the nci to conduct certain clinical trials for aag and kos we may rely on future collaborators to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates 
if any of these third parties do not successfully carry out their obligations or meet expected deadlines  clinical trials may be extended  delayed  suspended or terminated  and our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates 
some jurisdictions  including europe and the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
the fda and the european medicines agency have granted orphan drug status to aag for the treatment of multiple myeloma and chronic myelogenous leukemia 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process  but does make the product eligible for orphan drug exclusivity and  in the united states  specific tax credits 
generally  if a company receives the first marketing approval for a product with an orphan drug designation in the clinical indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity means that another application to market the same drug for the same indication may not be approved  except in limited circumstances  for a period of up to ten years in europe reviewable after six years  and for a period of seven years in the united states 
this exclusivity  however  could block the approval of kos if a competitor obtains approval before us of a product containing aag for the treatment of multiple myeloma or chronic myelogenous leukemia in the united states or europe 
even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any of our product candidates  we may not be able to maintain it 
for example  if a competitive product is shown to be clinically superior to our product  any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product 

table of contents kosan biosciences even if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval  we may still face significant development and regulatory difficulties 
even if the fda or other regulatory authorities approves a product candidate  the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses  conditions for use  labeling  advertising  promotion  marketing and or production of such product  and may impose ongoing requirements for post approval studies  including additional research and development and clinical trials 
in addition  regulatory agencies subject a product  its manufacturer and the manufacturer s facilities to continual review and periodic inspections 
if a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured  a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product  our collaborators or us  including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market 
if any of our approved products  our collaborators or we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  a regulatory authority may take various actions  including issuing warning letters  imposing civil or criminal penalties  suspending regulatory approval  refusing to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our collaborators  imposing restrictions on operations  including costly new manufacturing requirements  or seizing or detaining products or requiring a product recall 
any inability to protect our proprietary technologies could significantly harm our business and ability to successfully commercialize product candidates 
our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies and products in the united states and other countries and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have 
intellectual property laws vary from country to country  and the laws of a particular country may afford less intellectual property protection than another country 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
however  the patent positions of biotechnology companies  including our patent position  involve complex legal and factual questions  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty whether our patent applications will be allowed or any resulting patents will be valid and enforceable 
further  our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors could be placed into interference  and we may lose our rights in such patents or applications 
in particular  two of our exclusively licensed patents  which cover kos and its use  are the subject of an interference proceeding with a patent application concerning epothilones c  d  e  and f filed by gesellschaft f r biotechnologische forschung  or gbf 
this patent application is licensed to bristol myers squibb company 
patents may be challenged  held unenforceable  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties may not provide protection against competitors 

table of contents the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain  and we cannot ensure that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents or pending patent applications  we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  any of our or our licensors pending patent applications will result in issued patents  any of our or our licensors patents will be valid and enforceable  any patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products  will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business 
we apply for patents covering our technologies  drug candidates  formulations and uses thereof  as we deem appropriate 
however  we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or products in a timely fashion or at all 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies 
for example  aag  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the most advanced product candidate in our hsp inhibitor program  kos  was originally disclosed in a now expired third party patent 
consequently  others can develop products containing aag 
we are aware of at least two other companies that have been developing product candidates containing or based on aag  and these companies have filed patent applications relating to their products in development 
other competitors may be currently developing  or may in the future develop  products containing or based on aag 
in addition  we generally are unable to control the patent prosecution of technology that we license from others to the same degree as we would for our own technology 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we have taken measures to protect our confidential information and trade secrets 
however  these measures may not provide adequate protection 
we seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators  consultants and others 
nevertheless  parties may breach these agreements or competitors may otherwise obtain or independently develop our trade secrets 
patents related to one of our product candidates  kos  are the subject of an interference involving patent rights licensed to us 
oppositions have been filed in europe against patents granted to a third party that cover this compound 
these proceedings or any other proceedings are costly  and an unfavorable outcome could prevent us from commercializing this compound 
we are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies and compounds filed by  and issued to  other parties 
others have filed patent applications or have been granted patents claiming inventions also claimed or licensed by us  and we may have to participate in an interference or other proceeding before a patent agency or court to determine priority of invention or which party was first to invent and  thus  has the right to a patent for these inventions 
two of our exclusively licensed patents  which cover kos and its use  are the subject of an interference proceeding with a patent application concerning epothilones c  d  e and f filed by gbf 
gbf has licensed this patent application to bristol myers squibb company  one of our competitors 

table of contents kosan biosciences further  we believe one or more interferences may be declared between patents and applications we own or have exclusively licensed and patents and applications owned by novartis ag relating to epothilone biosynthetic genes  and patents and applications owned by abbott laboratories or biotica technologies ltd 
relating to erythromycin pks genes  methods for altering pks genes  and erythromycin analogs 
in april  a hearing was held at the european patent office to address an opposition filed by biotica to one of our exclusively licensed patents related to the recombinant production of polyketides 
although the written decision has not yet been issued  at the hearing  the patent was maintained upheld  but with narrowing amendments  the time for biotica to appeal the ruling has not yet expired 
in addition  the european patent office has recently granted patents to gbf  which have been licensed to bristol myers squibb company and which  if valid in individual european countries  would cover kos in those countries 
formal oppositions to these patents have been filed with the european patent office 
a proceeding or a lawsuit involving an interference or opposition could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable  and if the outcome is unfavorable  we could be required to license the other party s rights  on terms that may be unfavorable to us  or cease using the technology 
an interference or opposition may also result in loss of claims based on patentability grounds raised in the interference or opposition 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the biotechnology area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that a license would be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
companies and others developing products that could compete with our product candidates  such as bristol myers squibb company and novartis ag in the area of potential epothilone products  may be particularly unwilling to grant us a license at any price 
if we are not able to obtain necessary licenses  we may not be able to manufacture or commercialize  which could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims by third parties of intellectual property infringement would require us to spend time and money and could deprive us of valuable rights needed to develop or commercialize our products 
our commercial success depends significantly on not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products 
other parties may currently or in the future possess intellectual property rights covering drug candidates that we are developing or desire to develop  methods of treatment or administration involving our drug candidates  formulations of our drug candidates  and genes  gene fragments  cell lines  compounds and other technologies we use or may wish to use 
any infringement of patent rights or violation of other proprietary rights may require us to obtain a license from another party  forego product development or commercialization or face lawsuits or other claims 
the biotechnology industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
we are aware of patents and published patent applications that  if valid  and if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring the rights to these patents  may block our ability to commercialize products based on the drug candidates that we are developing or pursue our polyketide synthase  or pks  gene manipulation and production technologies 
we cannot be sure that other parties have not filed for or obtained relevant patents that could affect our ability to obtain patents or operate our business 
others may challenge our patent or other intellectual property rights or sue us for patent infringement  misappropriation of their intellectual property rights or breach of license agreements 
we may be required to commence legal proceedings to resolve our patent or other intellectual property rights 
an adverse determination in any litigation or administrative proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities  result in our patents being deemed invalid  unenforceable or revoked  require us to license disputed rights from others or to cease using the disputed technology 
in addition  our involvement in any of 
table of contents these proceedings may cause us to incur substantial costs and result in diversion of management and technical personnel 
other parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our products or the use of our technologies infringes these patents or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any claims that the use of our technologies infringes any patents  defending ourselves against any claim that we are employing any proprietary technology without authorization or enforcing our patents against others 
furthermore  parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to develop  commercialize and sell products  and could result in the award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us  we may be required to pay substantial damages  stop producing certain products and using certain methods  develop non infringing products and methods  and obtain one or more licenses from other parties 
we may not be able to obtain licenses from other parties at a reasonable cost  or at all 
if we are not able to obtain necessary licenses at a reasonable cost or at all  we could encounter substantial delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods and products  which we may not be able to accomplish 
litigation or the failure to obtain licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or commercializing products and could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
manufacturing difficulties could delay or preclude commercialization of our products and substantially increase our expenses 
we currently use two manufacturers to make aag  which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in kos  and kos we formulate the final drug product for kos at our own facility and through contract manufacturers 
we formulate the final drug product for kos through contract manufacturers 
the nci currently formulates drug product for the formulation of aag being studied by it under our crada 
we maintain a limited inventory of kos and kos at our facilities in hayward  california  and we also maintain a limited inventory at the facilities of an outside contractor 
the nci is not obligated to maintain an inventory of either the active pharmaceutical ingredient or formulated drug product for the formulation of aag or kos being studied by the nci under our crada 
in our epothilone program  we are the sole manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kos  and we rely on contract manufacturers for the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kos we use a single outside contractor to formulate drug product for kos  and drug product for kos is formulated at our facilities and by an outside contractor 
we maintain limited inventories of formulated drug product for kos and kos at our facilities in hayward  california and at the facilities of an outside contractor 
limited inventories of formulated drug product for kos are also maintained by roche 
if any of our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing or inventory facilities encounter delays  are destroyed or otherwise become unavailable to us  then the clinical development of our product candidates or submissions for their regulatory approval  and therefore commercialization  could be delayed or precluded 
adverse effects would be particularly acute if problems arise with our sole sourcing or inventory relationships 
alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all because manufacturing processes for our product candidates are complex and may be subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process 

table of contents kosan biosciences a number of factors could cause prolonged interruptions in the manufacturing and supply of our products  including the failure of a supplier to provide raw materials or key intermediates used for manufacture of our products  equipment malfunctions or failures  the failure to manufacture in accordance with current good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements  the delay of product shipments due to us custom regulations or third party carriers used to transport our products  and damage to our products while they are in transit  changes in fda or other regulatory authority requirements or standards that require modifications to the manufacturing processes or facilities used in the production of our products  action by the fda or other regulatory authorities to suspend production of one or more of our products  or difficulties in scaling up production of our products for large clinical trials or commercial supply 
while our manufacturing personnel have extensive experience from working at other companies  we as a company have no experience manufacturing products for commercial sale 
we may encounter difficulties in scaling up our manufacturing processes and equipment 
we may not be able to achieve such scale up in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost  if at all 
in addition  our facilities in hayward  california are located within the san francisco bay area  an area where earthquakes periodically occur 
our access to any key intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredient or formulated drug product for our product candidates sourced or inventoried solely through our facilities in hayward  california may be subject to interruption in the event of an earthquake 
as discussed above  we rely upon outside contractors to manufacture and supply to us key intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulated drug product for our product candidates 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates and components thereof may adversely affect our ability to continue in a timely manner clinical development of our product candidates and may adversely affect any future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that we may develop on a timely and competitive basis 
dependence on contract manufacturers involves a number of additional risks  many of which are outside of our control  including failure of a contract manufacturer to manufacture products to our specifications or to deliver products in the quantities or timeframe that we require  a decision by the fda or other regulatory authorities not to approve our use of a particular contract manufacturer to supply our products  intellectual property rights to any improvements in a manufacturing process or new manufacturing processes being owned by or shared with a contract manufacturer  termination of an agreement with a contract manufacturer or increased prices charged by a contract manufacturer  or a contract manufacturer declaring bankruptcy or otherwise going out of business 
any of these factors could cause us to delay or suspend clinical trials  regulatory submissions or commercialization of our products and could result in significantly increased costs 
in addition  our future contract manufacturers may not be in the united states  and we currently utilize contract manufacturers located outside the united states 
consequently  we may face additional manufacturing difficulties due 
table of contents to a number of potential factors  including importation and customs issues  political uncertainties and a potentially limited ability to enforce our contractual rights against parties not located within the united states 
we face intense competition from large pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies and academic groups 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from organizations such as large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies  that are pursuing competing technologies and products 
these organizations may develop or currently possess technologies or products that are superior alternatives to ours 
for example  companies with competing hsp inhibitors include conforma therapeutics  which has initiated phase i clinical trials with its formulation of aag in solid tumors and chronic myelogenous leukemia  infinity pharmaceuticals  which has initiated phase i clinical trials of its hsp inhibitor in multiple myeloma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors  and vernalis plc  which has announced plans to enter clinical trials of its hsp inhibitor in the second half of in collaboration with novartis ag  as well as other companies reported to be pursuing hsp inhibitors 
competing epothilones in clinical development include those being developed by bristol myers squibb reported to be in phase iii clinical trials  novartis ag reported to be in phase iii clinical trials and schering ag reported to be in phase ii clinical trials 
gastrointestinal motility competitors include chugai pharmaceuticals  whose motilide agonist is reported to be in phase ii clinical trials 
further  our competitors in the polyketide gene engineering field may be more effective at implementing their technologies to develop commercial products or may hold or develop patents or other proprietary rights that may prevent us from practicing our technologies and pursuing our programs 
some of these competitors have entered into collaborations with leading companies within our target markets to produce polyketides for commercial purposes 
any products that we develop through our technologies will compete in multiple  highly competitive markets 
development of pharmaceutical products requires significant investment and resources 
many of the organizations competing with us in the markets for such products have greater capital resources  research and development and marketing staffs  facilities and capabilities  and greater experience in discovery and developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals and product manufacturing and marketing 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in more rapidly developing and marketing technologies and products that are more effective than our technologies and products or that would render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on  among other things our ability to develop novel compounds with attractive pharmaceutical properties and to secure and protect intellectual property rights based on our innovations  the efficacy  safety and reliability of our product candidates  the speed at which we develop our product candidates  our ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of future products to the market  acceptance of future products by physicians and other healthcare providers  and the development of effective pricing and reimbursement strategies 

table of contents kosan biosciences if we face product liability claims  these claims will divert our management s time and we will incur litigation costs  and if we are held liable  our business  financial condition and results of operation may be materially harmed 
we face an inherent business risk of liability claims in the event that the use of our potential products in clinical trials or otherwise  or any other products manufactured in our facility  results in personal injury or death 
even though we have obtained product liability insurance  it may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us 
product liability insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
any claims against us  regardless of their merit  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation  because litigation related to these claims would strain our financial resources in addition to consuming the time and attention of our management 
if we are sued for any injuries caused by our products or products manufactured at our facility  our liability could exceed our total assets 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
some of these materials may be novel  including bacteria with novel properties and bacteria that produce biologically active compounds 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials 
in addition  we could be sued for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties or our collaborators of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development or commercialization efforts 
we have a stockholders rights plan and anti takeover provisions in our corporate charter documents that may result in outcomes with which you do not agree 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for third parties to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our certificate of incorporation provides for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors and prevents our stockholders from acting by written consent 
these provisions and other provisions of our bylaws and of delaware law applicable to us could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
this could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors 
this is because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team 
we have adopted a rights agreement under which all stockholders have the right to purchase shares of a new series of preferred stock at an exercise price of per one one hundredth of a share  if a person acquires more than of our common stock 
the rights plan could make it more difficult for a person to acquire a majority of our 
table of contents outstanding voting stock 
the rights plan could also reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without the rights plan 
in addition  the existence of the rights plan itself may deter a potential acquirer from acquiring us 
as a result  either by operation of the rights plan or by its potential deterrent effect  mergers and acquisitions of us that our stockholders may consider in their best interests may not occur 
some of our existing stockholders can exert control over us and may not make decisions that are in the best interest of all stockholders 
our officers  directors and their affiliates together controlled approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  these stockholders  if they act together  are able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of us and might affect the market price of our common stock  even when a change may be in the best interests of all stockholders 
in addition  the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders  and accordingly  they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements  which we would not otherwise consider 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
during the period from january  through december   our common stock traded between and on the nasdaq national market 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including announcements of technological developments in research by us or our competitors  delay or failure in initiating  conducting  completing or analyzing clinical trials or unsatisfactory design or results of these trials by our collaborators or us  developments in clinical trials for potentially competitive product candidates  changes in the united states or foreign health care systems or regulations  regulatory approvals for competitive product candidates or delays or failures by our collaborators or us in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors  published reports by securities analysts  announcements of expirations  terminations or amendments of collaborations  licenses or government research grants  or announcements that we have entered into new collaboration  licensing or similar arrangements  departures of key personnel  developments or disputes as to patent or other proprietary rights  litigation or an unfavorable outcome in litigation  sales of our common stock  including sales by previous executive officers and other former employees or consultants  announcements of  and actual or anticipated fluctuations in  our financial results  and economic and other external factors  disasters or crises 

table of contents kosan biosciences in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for biotechnology companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if this type of litigation were instituted against us  we would be faced with substantial costs and management s attention and resources would be diverted  which could in turn seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate  and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline  creating investor losses 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include expiration or termination of research contracts with collaborators or government research grants  which may not be renewed or replaced  the success rate of our efforts leading to milestone payments and royalties under our collaboration agreement with roche or any future collaboration or license agreements  the timing and willingness of collaborators to develop and commercialize our products  general and industry specific economic conditions  which may affect our collaborators research and development expenditures  and costs and expenses related to any litigation or administrative proceedings in which we may be involved 
if our revenues decline or do not grow due to expiration  termination or amendment of current or future collaboration agreements  licenses or government research grants  failure to obtain new contracts or other factors  we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses correspondingly 
in addition  we expect operating expenses to continue to increase 
failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenues could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in that case  our stock price would probably decline 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will require us to measure and recognize employee stock options as compensation expense on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which will require us to record a charge to earnings for the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans  effective january  this change will increase our future operating expenses but have no impact on our financial position 

table of contents if we are unable to favorably assess the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting  or if our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment  our stock price could be adversely affected 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  on an annual basis  our management is required to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to make its annual assessment are complex and require significant documentation and testing 
while our internal controls over financial reporting were deemed effective by both our management and our independent auditors as of december   there may be changes in our systems  processes or operations that will affect the effectiveness of internal controls in the future 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
our future assessments of internal controls may continue to result in increased expenses and the devotion of significant management resources 
if we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in the future  or if our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment  investor confidence and our stock price could be adversely affected

we are a biotechnology company advancing two new classes of anticancer agents  hsp inhibitors and epothilones  through clinical development 
following is the status of our product candidates 
hsp inhibitors kos kos is our proprietary formulation of aag  a geldanamycin analog 
kos is in phase i and ii clinical trials  primarily for multiple myeloma and her positive breast cancer 
in mid  we expect to announce interim results and the recommended phase ii dose from our phase ib clinical study of kos in combination with velcade in patients with multiple myeloma 
we also expect to announce interim results from our phase ib ii clinical trial of kos in combination with herceptin in patients with her positive breast cancer in mid if our phase ib results are favorable  we intend to initiate a phase ii iii registration study of kos in combination with velcade in patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in late or early kos intravenous and oral formulations of a second generation hsp inhibitor  kos  are currently in phase i clinical trials 
intravenous kos is also being studied in a phase ib clinical trial in combination with herceptin 
in mid  we expect to announce interim results from phase i clinical trials of intravenous kos if the final results from this phase i clinical trial  and our phase ib ii clinical trial of kos in combination with herceptin in patients with her positive breast cancer  are favorable  we intend to initiate late stage clinical trials of intravenous kos in combination with herceptin in patients with her positive breast cancer in epothilones kos kos is being evaluated in a phase ii clinical trial in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
in addition  kos is being evaluated in the phase ii portion of a phase ib ii clinical trial in combination with herceptin in patients with her positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
we expect that interim results from the phase ib ii clinical trial of kos in combination with herceptin will be announced in mid kos kos is our second generation epothilone anticancer candidate that is being evaluated in two dose escalating phase i clinical trials in patients with solid tumors 
we expect to announce interim results from our kos phase i clinical trials in mid our epothilone program is partnered with roche through a global development and commercialization agreement 
roche is funding all of the current kos and kos clinical trials 
we anticipate that roche will pursue late stage clinical development of only one of our epothilone product candidates  if any 
we anticipate that roche will make a decision in this regard in 
table of contents kosan biosciences we also have a motilin receptor agonist program for gi motility 
in september  we announced the selection of kos as a clinical candidate in this program 
we plan to file an ind with the fda or an application for clinical trial authorization with regulatory authorities in europe for kos in we also have additional research programs for cancer that are undergoing preclinical evaluation 
these programs are also based on the use of our technology to improve the structure of known polyketides and the efficiency of large scale production 
in march  we implemented a corporate restructuring  reflecting a realignment of research priorities and corporate operations to support our clinical product candidates and pipeline opportunities 
as a result  we reduced our workforce by positions  from to full time employees  primarily in research and general and administration 
the reduction in workforce is currently anticipated to result in a severance related charge of approximately million to million  representing the total estimated amount of the charge to be incurred in connection with the restructuring 
the severance related charge that we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring is subject to a number of assumptions  and actual results may differ  perhaps materially 
we may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of  or associated with  our decision to restructure 
we expect to complete the restructuring in the first quarter of we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years as we continue to advance our clinical product candidates into and through clinical trials 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our existing collaboration with roche will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into the first half of we expect that additional financing will be required in order to fund our operations 
critical accounting policies and management estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our research and development collaborations  investments  deferred tax assets and their related valuation allowance  financing operations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed by our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize license and other up front and initial fees pursuant to research and development collaboration agreements over the estimated research and development term of the agreement 
if the agreement does not have a specified research and development term  we must apply judgment in determining the appropriate level of recognition 
as of december   we had million in deferred revenue  representing the unamortized balance of the million initial fee received in connection with our collaboration with roche 
this initial fee is being amortized through the current estimated clinical development period 
any changes in our estimate will result in either an acceleration or further deferral of the related revenue recognition 

table of contents clinical trial accruals research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are established prior to the initiation of the related clinical trial  thus establishing the basis of our estimates 
however  these terms may be subject to amendment due to changes in the scope and length of the related clinical trial 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity and adjust our estimates accordingly 
the process by which we currently estimate our clinical trial accruals is consistent with prior periods and  in the past  there have not been significant adjustments of the actual results to our estimates 
over the next year  we expect that the clinical trials of our product candidates will increase our clinical development expenditures 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
we recognized other stock based compensation for non employees of approximately  in   in  and  in in addition  assuming no changes  we expect to recognize other stock based compensation in connection with stock options granted to non employees of approximately  in   in   in and  in the measurement of stock based compensation to non employees is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying securities vest 
as such  changes to these future period measurements could be substantial should we experience significant changes in our stock price 
for example  a increase in the price of our stock  from that of december   would translate into an approximately increase in the related estimated expenses above 
see notes and of our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which will require us to measure and recognize a charge to earnings for the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective basis  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based compensation payments at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption 
the adoption of sfas r will increase our future operating expenses and have no impact on our financial position

our research and development activities consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  clinical trial related services performed by clinical research organizations and research institutions and other outside service providers  licensing related expenses  lab consumables and facility related expenses 
we group these activities into two major categories research and preclinical and clinical development 
we are unable to estimate the nature  timing or costs to complete our major research and development projects  or when material net cash inflows to us could be expected to commence  if ever  due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products

for drug candidates that are in preclinical development  the timing of an ind filing varies significantly and is difficult to predict and therefore not reflected in the table above 
roche is funding all of the current kos and kos clinical trial costs 
we are responsible  at our cost  to supply aag for clinical trials sponsored by the nci under the cradas  and the nci is responsible for the remainder of the costs of these trials through phase ii

we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our existing collaboration with roche will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into the first half of we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors  including the following our ability to establish any new collaborations  our rights and obligations under any new collaboration agreements and our ability to generate revenues under any new collaborations  the extent to which clinical and other development activities are funded by our current collaborators  roche and the nci  the progress  success and costs of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates  any acceleration of our clinical development plans  our ability to maintain or extend our existing collaborations with roche and the nci  the progress  number and costs of our research programs  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property rights  any need to obtain licenses to additional patents or other intellectual property in order to use  import  manufacture  market or sell our product candidates  any need to expand our manufacturing capabilities  and expenses associated with any possible future litigation

additional financing or collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding our operations while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and investment grade corporate obligations 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our portfolio and cause unrealized gains and losses  such gains and losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  at december  rates  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately  on that date
