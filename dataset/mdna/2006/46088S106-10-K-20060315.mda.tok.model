item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements for additional information about our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risk factors related to our business we encounter industry risks related to operating and managing hotels that could cause our results of operations to suffer 
various factors could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues on which our management fees are based 
our business is subject to all of the operating risks inherent in the lodging industry 
these risks include  but are not limited to  the following changes in national  regional and local economic conditions  cyclical overbuilding in the lodging industry  varying levels of demand for rooms and related services  competition from other hotels  resorts and recreational properties  some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than we or the owners of the properties we manage have  the creditworthiness of the owners of the hotels that we manage and the risk of bankruptcy by hotel owners  uninsured property  casualty and other losses  disruptions due to weather conditions and other calamities  labor disturbances or shortages of labor  the ability of any joint ventures in which we invest to service any debt they incur and the risk of foreclosure associated with that debt  present or future environmental legislation  dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  decreases in air travel  fluctuations in operating costs  the effects of owners not funding recurring costs of operations  necessary renovations  refurbishment and improvements of hotel properties  changes in technology which may lead to changes in business  commercial and leisure travel frequency and or patterns  fluctuations in demand resulting from threatened or actual acts of terrorism or hostilities  changes in governmental regulations that influence or determine wages  prices and construction and maintenance costs  and changes in interest rates and the availability of credit 
demographic  geographic or other changes in one or more markets could impact the convenience or desirability of the sites of some hotels  which would  in turn  affect the operations of those hotels 
we encounter industry related risks related to our investments in and ownership of hotels and other real estate that could adversely impact its value to us 
as we hold or acquire interests in hotel properties  we are subject to the operating risks described in the immediately preceding risk factors 
with respect to hotels and real estate where we hold an ownership interest  in addition to the risks already enumerated  we have the following additional risks changes in local real estate market conditions  changes in the markets for particular types of assets  present or future environmental legislation  the recurring costs of necessary renovations  refurbishment and improvements of hotel properties  adverse changes in zoning and other laws  adverse changes in real estate tax assessments  construction or renovation delays and cost overruns  and limitations on our ability to quickly dispose of investments and respond to changes in the economic or competitive environment due to the relative illiquidity of real estate assets 
many of these factors will be beyond our control 
as we expand through acquisition or development of real estate  the magnitude of these risks may increase 
any of these factors could have a material and adverse impact on the value of our assets or on the revenues that can be generated from those assets 
in addition  due to the level of fixed costs required to operate upscale and select service hotels  significant expenditures necessary for the operation of these properties generally cannot be reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in revenue 
the corporate housing business model has inherent risks that could negatively impact profits on our corporate housing assets 
the corporate housing business generally operates with very low operating margins coupled with long average receivables collection cycles 
in addition  unexpected declines in occupancy can lead to higher vacancy rates in the apartments we lease resulting in the costs of these uncovered leases offsetting the operating profits on the apartments that are occupied 
this requires management to remain extremely diligent in evaluating and managing this business in order to maintain profitability and liquidity 
while we believe we have the proper resources and senior management team in place to succeed in this industry  to the extent we were unable to maintain liquidity  the resulting impact could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
the economy could adversely affect the performance of hotels and our retention of our existing hotel management agreements 
the economic slowdown that occurred during  and led to declines in room rates as hotels competed more aggressively for guests 
as the economy enters growth cycles  it could result in the disposition by hotel owners of hotels we manage  which could result in the loss of management contracts  which could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
if the economy again deteriorates  the economic slowdown may lead to an increased risk of bankruptcy by owners of hotels and or foreclosures on the hotel properties  which may inhibit our ability to collect fees under our management agreements or may lead to their termination 
our management agreements may be terminated or not renewed under various circumstances  including if the properties to which they relate are sold or otherwise disposed of by their owners  potentially impacting our results of operations materially 
if the owner of a property we manage disposes of the property  our management agreement may be terminated by the buyer 
similarly  if an owner of properties we manage is acquired  the subsequent owner may terminate our management agreements 
although the management agreements with our most significant owner  meristar  contain termination fee provisions  our management agreements with other owners generally have limited or no termination fees payable to us if a hotel is sold and the agreement is terminated 
the termination of management contracts as a result of hotel dispositions or otherwise could therefore have an adverse effect on our revenues 
we record termination fees as management fee revenue as the related payments are received 
as of december   approximately of our management agreements had current terms scheduled to expire within two years 
in addition  for certain of our owners  including meristar  we do not have the right to assign a management contract without prior written consent of the relevant hotel owner 
a change in control of our company would require the consent of these owners 
our owners may also terminate a management agreement if specified performance standards at the hotel are not met in consecutive calendar years 
in  we were notified by meristar that they believed that we had failed to meet the performance standards for consecutive years at hotels 
we have come to an agreement to pay meristar approximately million associated with the underperformance of these properties and accelerate a termination right  as noted earlier in item business relationship with meristar 
as of december   we managed properties owned by meristar 
during  meristar sold nine hotels one of which was the hilton durham  which we purchased and in early  they sold an additional hotels and one golf and tennis club 
we managed all of these properties in and do not expect to continue to manage them after the transition period to the new owners 
these properties accounted for million  or of our total management fees in we expect that the remaining termination fees for the properties sold in and will amount to a minimum of million 
if we are terminated as manager upon the sale of a meristar owned hotel  we will receive a termination fee 
the termination fees are based upon an average of the present value of remaining estimated management fees due to us under the contract a discounted as annual payments and b discounted based on a lump sum payment at the end of the contract term 
any termination fee will be paid in equal monthly installments  without interest  commencing the month following the termination 
meristar may reduce the termination fee by providing a new hotel for us to manage within months of the termination of the lost management contract to replace the terminated hotel 
we agreed to provide meristar with a million credit against termination fees owed for hotels to be sold all of which had been utilized as of december  in connection with the termination of the intercompany agreement  meristar also received some additional termination rights  as described under item business relationship with meristar termination of intercompany agreement 
on february   meristar announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by affiliates of blackstone 
the acquisition is expected to close during the first half of our management agreements for of the hotels blackstone will acquire as a result of the transaction are currently in place and were not affected by the acquisition  and the blackstone entities have and will have the same rights and duties including with respect to budget setting  asset management and termination as meristar under those contracts 
we are currently in discussions with blackstone as to its plans for meristar and the hotels  but it is possible that blackstone could terminate some or all of the management agreements with respect to those hotels or sell the hotels to new owners who might then terminate some or all of the agreements 
although  in most cases  blackstone or the new owners would be required to pay us termination fees if the management agreements were terminated 
the termination of these management contracts would most likely result in the write off of management contract intangible assets of approximately million and require an evaluation for potential impairment of our goodwill 
these hotels account for approximately  rooms and million in management fees in therefore  the termination of the management agreements with respect to those hotels could have a material  adverse effect on our hotel management revenues and our profitability 
a high percentage of the hotels we manage are upscale hotels  and our bridgestreet corporate housing division primarily services business travelers and high end leisure travelers  so we may be particularly susceptible to an economic downturn  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 
approximately of the rooms our hotel management division manages are in hotels that are classified as upscale  full service hotels 
these hotels generally command higher room rates 
however  in an economic downturn  these hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenues  as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates 
this characteristic results from hotels in this segment generally targeting business and high end leisure travelers 
in periods of economic difficulties  business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting trips or seeking to reduce costs on their trips 
the corporate housing segment is sensitive to economic conditions for the same reasons 
adverse changes in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the lease obligations of our corporate housing division  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure as a result of changes in demand for corporate housing  thereby leading to an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our corporate housing division has substantial commitments under leases that may not be cancelled 
as a result  if demand for corporate housing decreases  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to react to a decrease in demand  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
similarly  in areas such as the united kingdom  in which longer term leases are standard  we may not be able to readily adjust our corporate housing portfolio to take immediate advantage of shifting  advantageous growth and market conditions 
acts of terrorism  the threat of terrorism  the ongoing war against terrorism and other factors have impacted and will continue to impact the hotel industry and all hotel companies results of operations 
the threat of terrorism could have a negative impact on hotel operations  causing lower than expected performance  particularly in weak economic cycles 
the threat of terrorism could cause a significant decrease in hotels occupancy and average daily rate and result in disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns due to concerns about travel safety 
major metropolitan area and airport hotels have been adversely affected due to concerns about air travel safety and an overall decrease in the amount of air travel  particularly transient business travel 
future outbreaks of hostilities could have a material negative effect on air travel and on our business 
in addition  increased security measures at airports or in major metropolitan areas may also cause disruptions to our operations 
we have recently experienced significant improvements in operating levels compared to periods more proximate to the september  terrorist attacks 
however  the uncertainty associated with subsequent incidents and threats and the possibility of future attacks may continue to hamper business and leisure travel patterns 
in addition  potential future outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome  avian influenza or other diseases and similar disruptive events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations due to decreased travel and occupancy  especially in areas affected by the events 
we are dependent on the owners of the hotel properties we manage to fund expenditures related to those properties  and if such funds are untimely or not paid  we are required to bear the cost 
we incur significant expenditures related to the management of hotel properties  including salary and other benefit related costs and business and employee related insurance costs for which we are reimbursed by the hotel owners 
in the normal course of business we make every effort to pay these costs only after receiving payment from an owner for such costs 
however  to the extent an owner would not be able to reimburse these costs  due to a sudden and unexpected insolvency situation or otherwise  we would be required to pay these costs directly until such time as we could make other arrangements 
although  we would make every effort to eliminate these costs prior to the point at which an owner could not reimburse us and we would continue to pursue payment through all available legal means  our results of operations could be adversely affected if we were forced to bear those costs 
if we are unable to identify additional appropriate real estate acquisition or development opportunities and to arrange the financing necessary to complete these acquisitions or developments  our continued growth could be impaired 
we continually evaluate potential real estate development and acquisition opportunities 
any future acquisitions or developments will be financed through a combination of internally generated funds  additional bank borrowings from existing or new credit facilities  public offerings or private placements of equity or debt securities 
the nature of any future financing will depend on factors such as the size of the particular acquisition or development and our capital structure at the time of a project 
we may not be able to identify appropriate new acquisition or development opportunities and necessary financing may not be available on suitable terms  if at all 
an important part of our growth strategy will be the investment in  and acquisition of  hotels 
continued industry consolidation and competition for acquisitions could adversely affect our growth prospects going forward 
we will compete for hotel and other investment opportunities with other companies  some of which may have greater financial or other resources than we have 
competitors may have a lower cost of capital and may be able to pay higher prices or assume greater risks than would be prudent for us to pay or assume 
if we are unable to make real estate investments and acquisitions  our continued growth could be impaired 
a significant factor in our strategic plan is the creation of joint ventures to acquire hospitality properties 
should we be unsuccessful in creating joint ventures  our continued growth could be impaired 
the lodging industry and corporate housing market are highly competitive 
there is no single competitor or small number of competitors that are dominant either in the hotel management  lodging or corporate housing business 
we operate in areas that attract numerous competitors  some of which may have substantially greater resources than we or the owners of the properties that we manage have  including marriott international  inc  starwood hotel resorts worldwide  inc and hilton hotels corporation  among others 
competition in the lodging industry and corporate housing market is based generally on location  availability  room rates or corporate housing rates  range and quality of services and guest amenities offered 
new or existing competitors could lower rates  offer greater conveniences  services or amenities  or significantly expand  improve or introduce new facilities in markets in which we compete 
any of these factors could adversely affect operations and the number of suitable business opportunities 
in addition  we compete for hotel management contracts against numerous other companies  many of which may have more financial resources than we have 
these competitors include the management divisions of the major hotel brands as well as independent  non brand affiliated hotel managers 
our relationship with meristar may lead to conflicts of interest that adversely affect our stockholders interests 
we have historically had a close business relationship with meristar  and as of december   we managed of their properties 
paul w 
whetsell is the chief executive officer of meristar and is the chairman of both companies 
we and meristar may have conflicting views on the manner in which we manage meristar s hotels  as well as our and their future acquisitions and dispositions 
as a result  mr 
whetsell may be presented with decisions that provide him the opportunity to benefit meristar to our detriment or benefit us to the detriment of meristar 
inherently  potential conflicts of interest will be present in all of the numerous transactions between us and meristar 
in case of a potential conflict between us and meristar  we will form a special committee of our board of directors to consider the matter 
mr 
whetsell will recuse himself from all decision making and deliberations relating to the matter  as will any other directors with interests in the matter 
furthermore  because of the independent trading of the two companies  stockholders in each company may have divergent interests that could lead to conflicts of interest 
the divergence of interests could also reduce the anticipated benefits of our close relationship with meristar 
we may have conflicts relating to the sale of hotels subject to management agreements 
as described in more detail below  meristar will generally be required to pay a termination fee to us if it elects to sell or transfer a hotel to a person or entity that is not an affiliate of meristar or if it elects to permanently close a hotel after a casualty and does not replace it with another hotel with a management fee equal to that payable under the management agreement to be terminated 
meristar s decision to sell a hotel may  therefore  have significantly different consequences for meristar and us 
if meristar no longer qualifies as a reit or is otherwise permitted to manage and operate hotels  our hotel management business could be adversely affected 
for example  if meristar ceases to qualify as a reit  it would have the right to operate newly acquired properties itself 
if there is a change in the internal revenue code that would permit meristar or one of its affiliates to operate hotels without adversely affecting meristar s status as a reit  meristar would not be required to enter into future renewals of our management agreements 
furthermore  the anticipated change in control of meristar through the purchase by blackstone could have a negative effect on us  since our working relationship with blackstone may not be the same as our working relationship with meristar 
our international operations expose us to additional risks  which  if we fail to manage them adequately  may adversely impact our results of operations 
as we continue to grow our international presence  we are subject to various risks which include exposure to currency fluctuations  managing potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights  the burden of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations and the effects of potential and actual international terrorism and hostilities 
we are particularly sensitive to any factors that may influence international travel 
in addition  we cannot be certain of the effect that changing political and economic conditions could have on our international hotel and corporate housing operations and on our ability to collect on loans to third party owners overseas 
furthermore  the success of our international operations depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel who are familiar not only with our business and industry but also with the local commercial practices and economic environment 
we manage three hotels in moscow  russia as of december  our management fees earned from hotels located in russia were million  million and million  or  and of total management fees for  and  respectively 
we also manage three hotels in canada as of december  our management fees earned from hotels located in canada were million  million and million  or  and of total management fees for  and  respectively 
all of these management fees are paid in us dollars 
we have receivables outstanding from our operations in russia and former operations in portugal of million and million  respectively  including the note receivable and other receivables that can only be paid upon the receipt of certain exemption letters from the irs relating to foreign subsidiaries 
these receivables are subject to the additional risks associated with international operations 
third party hotel owners are not required to use the ancillary services we provide  which reduces the revenue we would otherwise receive from them 
in addition to traditional hotel management services  we offer to third party hotel owners several ancillary services such as purchasing  project management  insurance and risk management  information technology and telecommunication services  and centralized accounting services 
we expect to derive a portion of our revenues from these services 
our management contracts do not obligate third party hotel owners to utilize these services  and the failure of hotel owners to utilize these services could adversely affect our overall revenues 
we may be adversely affected by the limitations in our franchising and licensing agreements 
we are the brand franchisee of record of some of the hotels we have interests in or manage 
in addition  with respect to hotels for which we are not the franchisee  we may sign a manager acknowledgment agreement with the franchisor that details some of our rights and obligations with respect to the hotel and references the hotel s franchise agreement 
the franchise agreements generally contain specific standards for  and restrictions and limitations on  the operation and maintenance of a hotel in order to maintain uniformity within the franchisor s system 
those limitations may conflict with our philosophy of creating specific business plans tailored to each hotel and to each market 
standards are often subject to change over time  at the discretion of the franchisor  and may restrict a franchisee s ability to make improvements or modifications to a hotel without the consent of the franchisor 
in addition  compliance with standards could require a hotel owner to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures 
action or inaction by us or by the owner of a hotel could result in a breach of standards or other terms and conditions of the franchise agreements and could result in the loss or cancellation of a franchise license 
loss of franchise licenses without replacement would likely have an adverse effect on hotel revenues which could result in adverse affects to our overall revenues 
in connection with terminating or changing the franchise affiliation of a hotel  the owner of the hotel may be required to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures 
moreover  the loss of a franchise license could have a material adverse effect upon the operation or the underlying value of the hotel covered by the franchise due to the loss of associated name recognition  marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor 
franchise agreements covering the hotels we manage expire or terminate  without specified renewal rights  at various times and have differing remaining terms 
as a condition to renewal  these franchise agreements frequently contemplate a renewal application process 
this process may require an owner to make substantial capital improvements to a hotel 
although the management agreements generally require owners to make capital improvements to maintain the quality of a property  we are not able to directly control the timing or amount of those expenditures 
some of the franchise agreements under which we operate and manage hotels restrict the franchisee s ability to own or operate another hotel within a specified territory or with regard to specific hotels 
these limitations  if found to apply to us  may limit our ability to acquire new management agreements and potentially impair our continued growth 
costs of compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect operating results 
under various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements for the costs of investigation  monitoring  removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of these hazardous or toxic substances on a property could also result in personal injury or property damage or similar claims by private parties 
in addition  the presence of contamination or the failure to report  investigate or properly remediate contaminated property  may adversely affect the operation of the property or the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow using the property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person 
the operation and removal of underground storage tanks are also regulated by federal and state laws 
in connection with the ownership and operation of hotels  the operators  such as us or the owners of those properties could be held liable for the costs of remedial action for regulated substances and storage tanks and related claims 
activities have been undertaken to close or remove storage tanks located on the property of several of the hotels that we own or manage 
a significant number of the hotels that we own or manage have undergone phase i environmental site assessments  which generally provide a non intrusive physical inspection and database search  but not soil or groundwater analyses  by a qualified independent environmental consultant 
the purpose of a phase i assessment is to identify potential sources of contamination for which the hotel owner may be responsible 
the phase i assessments have not revealed  nor are we aware of  any environmental liability or compliance concerns that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
nevertheless  it is possible that these environmental site assessments did not reveal all environmen tal liabilities or compliance concerns or that material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns exist of which we are currently unaware 
in addition  a significant number of the hotels we own or manage have been inspected to determine the presence of asbestos 
federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations also require abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials and govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air 
asbestos containing materials are present in various building materials such as sprayed on ceiling treatments  roofing materials or floor tiles at some of the hotels 
operations and maintenance programs for maintaining asbestos containing materials have been or are in the process of being designed and implemented  or the asbestos containing materials have been scheduled to be or have been abated  at those hotels at which we are aware that asbestos containing materials are present 
any liability resulting from non compliance or other claims relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
aspects of hotel  resort  conference center  corporate housing and restaurant operations are subject to governmental regulation  and changes in regulations may have significant effects on business 
a number of states regulate various aspects of hotels  resorts  conference centers  corporate housing and restaurants  including liquor licensing  by requiring registration  disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct 
we believe we are substantially in compliance with these requirements or  in the case of liquor licenses  that we have or will promptly obtain the appropriate licenses 
managers of hotels and providers of corporate housing are also subject to employment laws  including minimum wage requirements  overtime  working conditions and work permit requirements 
compliance with  or changes in  these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of hotels and corporate housing units and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
under the americans with disabilities act  or ada  all public accommodations in the us are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
these requirements became effective in although owners of hotels we manage have invested significant amounts in ada required upgrades  a determination that the hotels we own or the units leased by our bridgestreet corporate housing division are not in compliance with the ada could result in a judicial order requiring compliance  imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the lodging business is seasonal 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
this may not be true  however  for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at the hotels we own or manage will cause quarterly fluctuations in revenues 
events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors  geopolitical conflicts  actual or potential terrorist attacks  and other considerations affecting travel may also adversely affect our earnings 
if we fail to retain our executive officers and key personnel our business could be harmed 
our ability to maintain our competitive position will depend  to a significant extent  on the efforts and ability of our senior management 
our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel is critical to our operations 
competition for personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining our personnel 
our inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
risk factors related to our capital structure restrictions imposed by our debt agreements may limit our ability to execute our business strategy and increase the risk of default under our debt obligations 
our credit facility contains restrictive covenants 
these restrictions include requirements to maintain financial ratios  which may significantly limit our ability to  among other things borrow additional money  make capital expenditures and other investments  pay dividends  merge  consolidate or dispose of assets  acquire assets  and incur additional liens 
for example  in connection with our purchase of the hilton concord in february  we entered into an amendment to our amended and restated senior secured credit facility  referred to as the credit facility  in order to modify certain liquidity covenants that we would have otherwise failed pursuant to the purchase of the hotel 
we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility in may we are in compliance with the amended loan covenants and expect to be in compliance for the remainder of the loan term 
while we believe that our current business plan and outlook will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations  a significant decline in our operations could reduce our cash from operations and cause us to be in default under other covenants in our debt agreements  leaving us unable to access our credit facility to supply needed liquidity to continue and implement new operations 
we will  in the future  be required to repay  refinance or negotiate an extension of the maturity of our credit facility 
however  our ability to complete a repayment  refinancing or extension is subject to a number of conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  if there were a disruption in the lodging or financial markets as a result of the occurrence of one of the risks identified above under risk factors related to our business or any other event  we might be unable to access the financial markets 
failure to complete a repayment  refinancing or extension of our credit facility would have a material adverse effect on us 
impairments of assets or goodwill may increase the risk of default under our debt obligations 
we are required to evaluate our assets  including goodwill  annually or upon certain trigger events in order to ascertain that the historical carrying value is not less than the fair market value of the asset 
should we determine that an asset s carrying value is less than its fair market value  the asset would be considered impaired we would record a write down of the asset to its current fair value 
our current debt covenants require us to maintain certain ratios  including a minimum net worth 
to the extent a write down would reduce our asset base we could fall below that net worth and fail that test 
if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment to the covenant the resulting default could adversely affect our liquidity 
a deficit in working capital may reduce funds available to us for expansion of our business 
as of december   we had a deficit in working capital of million 
this deficit in working capital may require us to make additional borrowings to pay our current obligations 
such borrowings would serve to reduce amounts available to us for pursuit of our business strategy of growing through securing additional management contracts and acquiring additional hotel  resort and conference center properties 
our stockholder rights plan and the anti takeover defense provisions of our charter documents may deter potential acquirers and depress our stock price 
under our stockholder rights plan  holders of our common stock hold one preferred share purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock they hold  exercisable under defined circumstances involving a potential change of control 
the preferred share purchase rights have the anti takeover effect of causing substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
those provisions could have a material adverse effect on the premium that potential acquirers might be willing to pay in an acquisition or that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
provisions of delaware law and of our charter and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us 
these provisions could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of us under circumstances that could otherwise give the holders of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
these provisions include the following we are able to issue preferred shares with rights senior to our common stock  our certificate of incorporation prohibits action by written consent of our stockholders  and our stockholders are not able to call special meetings  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  our certificate of incorporation provides  with some exceptions  that holders of more than of meristar s equity stock may not own more than of the shares of any class of our stock  our directors are subject to removal only for cause and upon the vote of two thirds of the outstanding shares of our common stock  our bylaws require advance notice for the nomination of directors and for stockholder proposals  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which limits our ability to enter into business combination transactions with interested stockholders  and specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be amended only upon the affirmative vote of two thirds of the outstanding shares

financial highlights and significant events financial highlights our strong operating results in were driven by excellent performance in each of our reportable segments  hotel management  corporate housing and hotel ownership 
although the number of hotel properties in which we manage decreased at the end of compared to the end of  our management fees increased in compared to this is primarily due to our focus on retaining profitable management contracts  an increase in revpar year over year and an increase in incentive fees of million  or  which are tied directly to the operating performance of the hotels in which we manage 
the increase in incentive fees is due to market conditions which exceeded our expectations and improved operating performance at our managed properties 
the increase in management fee revenues also reflects an increase in termination fees of million  or  from those properties that left our system in compared to our corporate housing operations  in addition to an increase in revenues of nearly million  or  which was achieved while operating fewer units as compared to  improved gross margins from in to in the improvement was driven by the strategic management of our apartment inventory cycle 
by focusing on obtaining more flexible lease terms  we were able to quickly add or remove units in particular markets based on demand 
as our unit inventory was more closely aligned with the current demand of our markets  we were able to increase our adr by while also improving our occupancy to well over  an improvement of from we also showed significant growth in our global account sales by becoming the sole or preferred provider for numerous international companies with corporate housing needs throughout the world 
finally  the hilton concord contributed million to our operating margins while the operating margins of the residence inn pittsburgh remained flat from we also realized the benefit of successful hotel investments as two properties in which we had a joint venture ownership interest were sold in  resulting in cash distributions and income of more than million 
significant events there have been numerous events in and recently in which will have an impact on our operations in and beyond 
in february  we purchased the hilton concord in the east bay area near san francisco  ca for a purchase price of approximately million 
in order to finance the acquisition of the hilton concord  we entered into a million non recourse mortgage loan 
in november  we purchased the hilton durham in durham  nc for a total purchase price of approximately million 
these acquisitions are part of our long term growth strategy to increase our hotel ownership 
this will allow us to benefit from the operating profit of the hotels while also strengthening our balance sheet 
we were able to acquire certain key management contracts during the year which we expect will positively impact our long term operations 
in july  we began managing the claremont resort spa in berkeley  ca  which features acres of resort amenities  guest rooms  a  square foot spa and  square feet of meeting space 
in september  we began managing the sheraton myrtle beach convention center hotel  which features guest rooms and is adjacent to  square feet of conference space at the convention center 
in addition to acquiring key management contracts  including  but not limited to  the ones mentioned above  we are also faced with the possibility of losing similar type contracts 
in march  we began operating a portfolio of upscale hotels owned by a partnership consisting of a private investment fund managed by affiliates of goldman sachs and highgate holdings 
at the end of  we continued to manage of these properties 
in  we were notified that the private investment fund will be ending our management contracts and highgate holdings will begin managing these properties 
in connection with its previously announced asset disposition program  meristar sold nine properties in  including the hilton durham  which we purchased 
they sold an additional hotels and a golf and tennis club in we managed all of these properties in and do not expect to continue to manage them after the transition period to the new owners 
these properties include over  rooms and accounted for million  or  of total management fees in we estimate that the remaining termination fees to be received from these properties will amount to a minimum of million 
also  we will recognize million of impairment losses related to the write off of intangible assets from these management contracts 
on february   meristar announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by affiliates of blackstone 
the acquisition is expected to close during the first half of our management agreements for of the hotels blackstone will acquire as a result of the transaction are currently in place and were not affected by the transaction  and the blackstone entities have and will have the same rights and duties including with respect to budget setting  asset management and termination as meristar under those contracts 
we are currently in discussions with blackstone as to its plans for meristar and the hotels 
the hotels account for approximately  rooms and million in management fees in we believe that this turnover in management contracts is an inherent part of our business  especially in this type of market which lends itself to a large volume of hotel transactions 
by continuing to focus on our hotel operations and delivering results to the hotel owners  we believe that we will be positioned to capitalize on the rising lodging market and gain significant management contracts in and beyond 
in  hurricanes damaged or closed properties we managed for meristar 
in february  we and meristar agreed to a settlement with the insurance carrier for business interruption proceeds 
in accordance with the settlement  we expect to receive business interruption proceeds of million during the first quarter of at that point we will recognize the proceeds in our statement of operations 
in february  bridgestreet acquired twelve oaks corporate housing  a chicago based entity with approximately furnished apartment units for approximately million 
the acquisition includes the assumption of all leases related to twelve oaks  furnished apartment complexes in and around the chicago area  as well as the purchase of all of twelve oaks furniture and equipment 
the acquisition nearly doubles our presence in the chicago market 
industry overview  strategic initiatives and challenges and risks industry overview both us  the lodging and corporate housing industries have been impacted by several events occurring over the previous several years  including the global economic downturn  the september th terrorist attacks  the global outbreak of sars in and military action in iraq 
following hurricane katrina  the worst natural disaster to ever affect the continental us  the local lodging industry experienced significant disruptions damaging and closing hotels along coastal louisiana and mississippi 
our corporate housing operations are subject to international and national conditions 
as we conduct our business on a national and international level  our activities are susceptible to changes in the performance of regional and global economies 
through the end of  our business had been hurt by decreases in travel resulting from the events noted above 
this had negatively impacted the demand for corporate relocations and long term assignments  two primary drivers of our corporate housing operations 
over the last two years  the real estate industry has been in an upswing 
this is directly influenced by the current economic situation both on a national and global level 
we anticipate that the favorable economic environment will continue to benefit us and the lodging and corporate housing industries  as a whole 
during  us real gross domestic product  or gdp  increased from revpar has increased since and is at its highest since  including the adjustment for inflation 
this growth is forecasted to slow in and as the demand growth is not expected to continue at the current levels of past years 
adr and occupancy have also increased since a continuation of strong hotel demand among business  group and leisure travelers  combined with full service and limited service hotel supply growth  enabled these increases 
looking ahead  adr is forecasted to improve approximately each year during and while occupancy is forecasted to experience minimal growth during and within the lodging industry 
financial targets  growth strategy and operating strategy we were pleased with our strong financial performance in and expect to achieve similar operating results for by taking advantage of the forecasted expansion of the hotel and corporate housing industries and executing on our focused growth and operating strategies  we anticipate that we can continue to achieve solid operating results related to revenues  net income and earnings per dilutive share in we will continue to execute on our focused growth strategy which requires expansion through four diverse yet interrelated avenues of our business 
first and foremost  to continue as a leader in the hotel management industry  it is imperative that we work to secure additional management contracts on quality properties  our core business 
these additional contracts will allow us to implement our operating approach at additional hotels and secure stabilized revenue streams 
we are also focused on additional investments through the creation of joint ventures  in which we generally will have an ownership interest between and 
through these investments  which are also another vehicle to gain long term management contracts  we are able to share in the earnings and the potential asset appreciation of these properties while continuing to earn management fees 
we will seek to acquire these interests in upscale  full service hotels  and select service hotels  conference centers and resorts where we believe an opportunity exists to increase value through our operating expertise  market recovery and repositioning 
in addition  we will identify properties that are promising acquisition candidates located in markets with economic  demographic and supply dynamics favorable to hotel owners 
we will select these acquisition opportunities where we believe selected capital improvements and focused management will increase the property s ability to attract key demand segments  demonstrate better financial performance  and increase long term value 
finally  we will selectively invest in corporate housing through internal growth initiatives  the purchase of corporate housing businesses and corporate housing management contracts 
although part of achieving our goals for will result through the growth strategy discussed above  we will not be successful unless we also continue to focus on implementing our operating strategy  which was a major factor of our success in most importantly  at our hotel properties  we re emphasized our dedication to service  through a renewed commitment to guest satisfaction surveys  improved training of hotel employees and specialists who focus on improving the operations of designated brands under our management 
based on the operating results and feedback received at our managed properties  we have seen tangible evidence that this service commitment has produced positive results 
we will also continue to rely on our ability to analyze each hotel as a unique property and identify specific opportunities for cash flow growth at each hotel in order to generate higher revpar and net operating income 
in our corporate housing operations  we expect to continue to improve our financial performance through the use of the smartgrowth model  in which we strive to match our supply of accommodations with current and anticipated client demand in order to reduce our financial exposure under leases 
we believe this flexible leasing strategy allows us to efficiently react to changes in market demand for particular geographic locations and types of accommodations 
we are also considering the implementation of a furniture ownership program in key markets  which would allow us to reduce operating costs associated with furnishing our rental units 
in all of our business segments  we will continue to rely on the experience of our senior management teams  which have successfully managed hotels in all sectors of the lodging industry and also have extensive experience in the corporate housing industry 
challenges and risks our ability to implement our growth and operating strategies and as a result  achieve our expected financial results  could be affected by various challenges and risks 
these include overall industry related factors  which have been discussed in the risk factors section above  and other factors which are more specific to us 
our growth strategy  specifically the investment in  and acquisition of hotels  could be affected by continued industry consolidation and competition  which would limit the amount and nature of opportunities for us to consider 
this growth could also be limited by our capital structure  as our debt agreements include restrictions which could prevent us from raising additional capital needed to take advantage of desired acquisition and investment opportunities 
in addition  the market value of our common stock could make financing through an equity offering a less attractive option 
due to the significant number of hotel purchase and sale transactions in the market place  our portfolio of managed properties could be adversely impacted 
if the owners of our managed properties sell their properties  we could lose additional management contracts 
our success in also makes our key personnel attractive to other hotel management and corporate housing companies 
the failure to retain these personnel could lead to losing competitive advantages which have driven our operating successes 
in addition  although increases in operating costs  such as labor  utilities and insurance can partially be passed on to the customer  there is a limit to the adr which the customer will accept 
if these operating costs rise to certain levels  profit margins at our owned hotels and management fees related to our managed properties could be negatively affected 
critical accounting polices and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the company has discussed the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets which include our intangible assets with determinable useful lives may be impaired  we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
these events or circumstances may include  but are not limited to  projected cash flows which are significantly less than the most recent historical cash flows  a significant loss of management contracts without the realistic expectation of a replacement  and economic events which could cause significant adverse changes and uncertainty in business and leisure travel patterns 
in our analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value  we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
impairment of goodwill we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or other circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
we evaluate the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and make that determination based upon future cash flow projections 
assumptions used in these projections  such as forecasted growth rates  cost of capital and multiples to determine the terminal value of the reporting units  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we record an impairment loss when the implied fair value of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of one reporting unit  including goodwill 
income taxes we use our judgment in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods 
a valuation allowance is required to be established against deferred tax assets unless we determine that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
at december   we have a valuation allowance of million to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
this is an allowance against some  but not all  of our recorded deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance we recorded includes the effect of the limitations on our deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss carryforwards 
the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited by the provisions of the internal revenue code 
we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
our estimates of taxable income require us to make assumptions about various factors that affect our operating results  such as economic conditions  consumer demand  competition and other factors 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
based on actual results or a revision in future estimates  we might determine that we would not be able to realize additional portions of our net deferred tax assets in the future  if that occurred  we would record a charge to the income tax provision in that period 
revenue recognition we earn revenue from hotel management contracts and related services  corporate housing operations and operations of our wholly owned hotels 
generally  revenues are recognized when services have been rendered 
given the nature of our business  revenue recognition practices do not contain estimates that materially affect results of operations 
the following is a description of the composition of our revenues hotel management our management and other fees consist of base and incentive management fees received from third party owners of hotel properties and fees for other related services we provide 
management fees are comprised of a base fee  which is generally based on a percentage of gross revenues  and an incentive fee  which is generally based on the property s profitability 
we record the incentive management fees in the period that it is certain the incentive management fees will be earned  which for annual incentive fee measurements is typically in the last month of the annual contract period 
these revenue sources are affected by conditions impacting the travel and hospitality industry as well as competition from other hotel management companies 
termination fees are also included in these amounts 
these amounts are typically generated from properties managed for meristar as a result of the sale of the hotel to a third party or if the hotel is destroyed and not rebuilt after a casualty or if we are removed as manager of the property 
termination fees are recorded as revenue as they are received 
corporate housing bridgestreet  our corporate housing subsidiary  recognizes revenue from our corporate housing services in metropolitan markets located in the united states  the united kingdom and paris 
we recognize fees when earned in accordance with the individual leasing contract 
hotel ownership lodging revenues consists of amounts primarily derived from hotel operations  including the sales of rooms  food and beverage  and other ancillary amenities 
revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied and services have been rendered 
as with management fees discussed above  these revenue sources are affected by conditions impacting the travel and hospitality industry as well as competition from other hotels and businesses in similar markets

consequently  the amount of reimbursed hotel employee salaries  benefits and other expenses increased 
these amounts represent the payroll and related costs of the hotels employees which is contractually reimbursed to us by the hotel owners 
reimbursable expenses decreased in compared to as the average number of properties under management was lower in than as such  reimbursed hotel employee salaries  benefits and other expenses were also lower

these increases are offset by a decrease of approximately million in expenses following the closing of one of our management subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the termination of the certain management contracts 
administrative and general expenses increased by million in compared to this increase was primarily due to increases associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  negotiations of a proposed transaction that was not consummated and incentive compensation programs  offset by the closing of our flagstone subsidiary in the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization although we purchased two hotels in and our net fixed assets increased more than million  our depreciation and amortization expense remained flat between years

cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities working capital cash interest expense debt balance operating activities the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily driven by the significant increases in operating income and net income 
when comparing cash provided by operating income from to  after removing a one time non cash gain on refinancing of million in  net income increased by million from to this increase in net income was the primary driver of the increase in cash provided by operating activities between these years 
investing activities the major components of the increase in cash used in investing activities from to were the purchase of two hotels  the hilton concord and hilton durham  in for a total net purchase price of approximately million 
these purchases were offset by the sale of the residence inn pittsburgh for million 
there were no hotel acquisitions or dispositions in the above was offset by the receipt of cash distributions of approximately million in related to our share of the sale of three hotels in which we held a partial ownership interest through a joint venture 
in  we made cash contributions of approximately million related to various investments in joint ventures 
the major components of the decrease of cash used in investing activities from to were the purchase of property and equipment as well as leasehold improvements related to the relocation of our corporate offices to arlington  va in totaling approximately million 
an increase in the restricted cash balance of approximately million 
our insurance subsidiary has restricted cash  which is determined based on statutory requirements and is directly related to premiums written during the year 
we also have restricted cash at our purchasing subsidiary  which represents cash that our clients have advanced to us for capital projects 
these balances will fluctuate due to the timing and status of various projects at year end 
the above changes were offset by the acquisition of sunstone in for million 
the majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and intangible assets  as management contract costs 
financing activities in and  we borrowed approximately the same amount of long term debt that we repaid resulting in no net effect on cash from financing activities 
the change in financing activities was due to additional financing fees of approximately million  incurred in in connection with the refinancing of our long term debt 
the change in cash from financing activities from to was due to a public equity offering in  in which we offered  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at a price of per share 
the underwriters also exercised their over allotment option for an additional  shares 
our net proceeds from the equity offering amounted to approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to reduce our debt balance under our senior credit facility by approximately million 
we also incurred additional financing fees in of approximately million related to a subordinated term loan 
liquidity liquidity requirements our known short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures  including corporate related expenses such as payroll and related benefits  legal costs  and other costs associated with the management of hotels and corporate housing facilities  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness  and capital expenditures  which includes renovations and maintenance at our owned hotels  apartment furnishings at our corporate housing apartments and various corporate additions 
our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities and costs associated with potential acquisitions 
our credit facility matures in january  and a non recourse mortgage loan matures in march we will continue to implement our growth strategy by seeking acquisitions of wholly owned and joint venture interests in hotel properties 
we are also interested in investment opportunities to acquire hotel management businesses and management contracts 
in addition  we will selectively invest in corporate housing through the purchase of corporate housing businesses and corporate housing management contracts 
we have historically satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through cash provided by our operations 
we believe that amounts available under our credit facility and cash provided by operations will continue to be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
however  our short term liquidity could be influenced by various factors 
in today s market  in which there is a large volume of hotel purchase and sale transactions  we have a greater risk of management contract attrition and  conversely  also an increased opportunity to gain management contracts 
we believe that our risk related to this turnover is partially mitigated due to our size and diversity across owners and brand affiliations 
in addition  our contracts are structured such that we typically earn a termination fee if the contract is terminated early due to change of control 
this allows us to use the additional cash flow from terminated management contracts either to pay down debt or attempt to replace that earnings stream through investment pursuant to our growth strategy 
the overall economy is also a factor in the uncertainty and variability of our cash flows 
to the extent business and leisure travel is declining  we will see a decrease in our earnings and therefore our cash flow 
we have historically satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including cash provided by operations  bank credit facilities  long term mortgage indebtedness and the issuance of equity 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our access to these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets if any  our public debt ratings and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
under the revolving loan of our credit facility  we have a total capacity of million  of which there is approximately million available to borrow as of december  additionally  we must maintain compliance with quarterly financial covenants  including debt coverage ratio and interest coverage ratios and a minimum net worth in order to continue to have funds available to borrow under our credit facility 
in connection with the purchase of the hilton concord hotel in february  we entered into amendments to our credit facility in february and may to give us greater flexibility on the related covenant tests 
we continually monitor our operating and cash flow models in order to forecast our compliance with the financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities is dependent upon  among other things  general market conditions and market perceptions about our company 
we will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but equity and debt financing may not be consistently available to us on terms that are attractive or at all 
expectations for we expect to use additional cash flows from operations and amounts available under the credit facility to pay required debt service  income taxes and make planned capital purchases for our wholly owned hotels and corporate housing 
this includes renovations and regular capital expenditures for maintenance 
any additional cash available will be put toward investments  such as whole ownership or joint venture ownership of hotels  which meet the focus of our investment strategy 
if none of these investments become available  we will pay down debt with excess cash flow until those investments become available 
a joint venture investment would most likely be financed through our current working capital  cash flows from operations and the revolving term loan of our credit facility 
an acquisition of a wholly owned hotel would likely be financed through a combination of our cash flows from operations  the revolving term loan of our credit facility and non recourse mortgage debt 
senior credit facility in january  we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility with various lenders 
the credit facility  as previously defined  which is scheduled to mature on january   provides aggregate loan commitments for a million term loan and a million revolving loan 
when we entered into the amended credit facility  we borrowed approximately million  including the entire million term loan and million under the revolving loan  leaving million outstanding 
as of december   we repaid million of the term loan  leaving million outstanding 
we had million outstanding under our revolving loan  leaving approximately million of availability 
we are required to make quarterly payments of million on the term loan until its maturity date 
the actual interest rates on both the revolving loan and term loan depend on the results of certain financial tests 
as of december   based on those financial tests  borrowings under the revolving loan bore interest at a rate of libor plus basis points a rate of at december  and borrowings under the term loan bore interest at a rate of libor plus basis points a rate of at december  
the debt under our credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our existing wholly owned subsidiaries and collateralized by pledges of ownership interests  owned hospitality properties  and other collateral that was not previously prohibited from being pledged by any of our existing contracts or agreements 
our credit facility contains covenants that include maintenance of financial ratios at the end of each quarter  compliance reporting requirements and other customary restrictions 
in connection with the purchase of the hilton concord hotel  we entered into amendments to our senior credit facility in february and may in order to modify certain liquidity covenants that we would have otherwise failed pursuant to the purchase of the hotel 
at december   we are in compliance with the amended loan covenants and expect to be in compliance for the remainder of the loan term 
mortgage debt in february  we entered into a million non recourse mortgage loan to finance the acquisition of the hilton concord hotel 
we are required to make interest only payments until the loan matures in march the loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points rate of at december  
shelf registration statement in august  we filed a form s shelf registration statement registering up to million of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock and warrants 
the registration statement also registered the  shares of our common stock held by cglh partners i  lp and cglh partners ii  lp  which are beneficially owned by certain of our directors 
the cglh partnerships have the right to include their shares in the registration statement pursuant to a registration rights agreement they executed with us at the time of our july merger with interstate hotels corporation 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect that those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payment terms less than more than total year years years year senior credit facility revolving loan a senior credit facility term loan a mortgage debt a estimated interest payments on long term debt b non cancelable apartment leases c d e non cancelable office leases c total a for principal repayment obligations with respect to our long term debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect to settle such long term debt by several options  including cash flows from operations and issuance of other long term debt 
b to estimate interest payments on our long term debt  which is variable rate debt  we estimated interest rates and payment dates based on our determination of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument 
we expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operations or short term borrowings 
c the non cancelable leases shown in the table include the minimum annual rental commitments related to our leased apartments for our corporate housing division and the office space for our corporate offices 
the office lease obligations shown in the table above have not been reduced by minimum payments to be received related to a non cancelable sublease at our corporate offices 
these offsetting payments aggregate to approximately million through august the company remains secondarily liable under this sublease in the event that the sublessee defaults under the sublease terms 
the company does not believe that material payments will required as a result of the secondary liability provisions of the primary lease agreement 
d the non cancelable leases also includes the leases assumed  related to the furnished apartment complexes as a result of the purchase of the twelve oaks in february e our corporate housing division signed an agreement to manage two apartment buildings in london 
we expect to begin managing these units in may as part of the agreement we will guarantee the owner a minimum annual rental payment of approximately million  with increases of per annum for the first five years 
we are including the annual rent guarantee in the above table using a march  exchange rate 
in addition  included in these amounts is a minimum revenue guarantee to the owner on a management contract we entered in january as part of the agreement  we have guaranteed the owner  an annual payment of million for three years commencing july we also have the following commitments and off balance sheet arrangements currently outstanding management agreement commitments under the provisions of management agreements with certain hotel owners  we have outstanding commitments to provide an aggregate of million to these hotel owners in the form of investments or loans  if requested 
as the timing of these future investments or working capital loans to hotel owners is currently unknown as it is at the hotel owner s discretion  they are not included in the above table 
in january  bridgestreet entered into a year management agreement to operate two apartment buildings with a leading london developer 
the agreement is expected to commence in the second quarter of as part of the terms of the agreement  bridgestreet has guaranteed the developer an annual payment of approximately million  with increases of per year for the first five years 
this equates to a reduction in normalized rent expense for that market of 
letters of credit we have a million letter of credit outstanding from northridge insurance company in favor of our property insurance carrier 
the letter of credit expires on april  the company is required by the property insurance carrier to deliver the letter of credit to cover their losses in the event we default on payments to the carrier 
accordingly  the bank has required us to restrict a portion of our cash equal to the amount of the letter of credit 
we also have a  letter of credit outstanding from societe generale in favor of the insurance carrier that issues surety bonds on behalf of the properties we manage 
the letter of credit expires on june  the company is required by the insurance carrier to deliver the letter of credit to cover their risk in the event the properties default on their required payments related to the surety bonds 
equity investment funding in connection with our equity investments in hotel real estate  we are partners or members of various unconsolidated partnerships or limited liability companies 
the terms of such partnership or limited liability company agreements provide that we contribute capital as specified 
the timing and amount of such contributions of capital  if any  is currently unknown and is therefore not reflected in the chart set forth above 
we have minority interests in seven hotel real estate limited partnerships and limited liability companies 
we do not guarantee the debt or other obligations of any of these investments 
insurance matters as part of our management agreement services to a hotel owner  we generally obtain casualty workers compensation and liability insurance coverages for the hotel 
in december  one of the carriers we used to obtain casualty insurance coverages was downgraded significantly by rating agencies 
in january  we negotiated a transfer of that carrier s current policies to a new carrier 
we are working with the prior carrier to facilitate a timely and efficient settlement of the claims outstanding under the prior carrier s casualty policies 
the prior carrier has primary responsibility for settling those claims from its assets 
if the prior carrier s assets are not sufficient to settle these outstanding claims  and the claims exceed amounts available under state guaranty funds  we may be required to settle those claims 
we are indemnified under our management agreements for such amounts 
prior to january  we leased certain hotels from owners 
we are responsible for claims related to leased hotels 
during  the prior carrier presented invoices to us and other policy holders related to dividends previously granted to us and other policy holders with respect to the prior policies 
we have received documentation validating the nature and amount of the invoiced amount 
based on this information we have determined that the amount is probable and estimable and have therefore recorded the liability 
in september  we invoiced the prior carrier for premium refunds due to us on previous policies 
the initial premiums on these policies were calculated based on estimated employee payroll expenses and gross hotel revenues 
due to the september th terrorist attacks  the estimated premiums billed were significantly overstated and as a result  we are owed refunds on the premiums paid 
we believe that we hold the legal right of offset in regard to this receivable and payable with the prior insurance carrier 
accordingly  there is no effect on the statement of operations in we will aggressively pursue collection of our receivable and do not expect to pay any amounts to the prior carrier prior to reaching an agreement with them regarding the contractual amounts due to us 
to the extent we do not collect sufficiently on our receivable  we would vigorously attempt to recover any additional amounts from our owners 
sunstone liabilities we purchased sunstone hotel properties  inc  which we refer to as sunstone  on october  as part of the purchase we assumed the liabilities of that company which included certain employee related liabilities such as workers compensation and liabilities under a defined benefit pension plan 
we are indemnified by sunstone hotel investors  which we refer to as sunstone reit  for these liabilities 
we recorded the liabilities for workers compensation and the pension plan on our balance sheet and recorded a receivable for the same amount from the owner  sunstone reit  at the time of the purchase 
in addition  we also have a million letter of credit outstanding from sunstone reit  for these and other assumed liabilities 
to the extent sunstone reit would be unable to reimburse us for these liabilities and they would exceed the amount outstanding on their letter of credit to us  we would be primarily liable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our credit facilities 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
as of december   all of our debt is at variable rates based on current libor rates 
in january  we entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit facility  referred to as the credit facility  with various lenders 
the credit facility replaces our previous senior secured credit facility and provides aggregate loan commitments for a million term loan and a million revolving loan 
the scheduled maturity of the credit facility is january  the actual interest rates on both the revolving loan and term loan depend on the results of certain financial tests 
as of december   based on those financial tests  borrowings under the revolving loan bore interest at a rate of libor plus basis points rate of at december  and borrowings under the term loan bore interest at a rate of libor plus basis points rate of at december  
when we entered into the credit facility  we borrowed approximately million  including the entire million term loan and million under the revolving loan 
we used those amounts to repay an existing million subordinated term loan and million outstanding under our previous credit facility 
as of december   we have repaid million of term loans and had million outstanding under our revolving loan  leaving approximately million of availability 
we are required to make quarterly payments of million on the term loan until its maturity date

our credit facility contains covenants that include maintenance of financial ratios at the end of each quarter  compliance reporting requirements and other customary restrictions 
in february  we entered into a million non recourse mortgage loan to finance the acquisition of the hilton concord hotel 
we are required to make interest only payments until the loan matures in march the loan bears interest at a rate of libor plus basis points rate of at december  
in connection with the purchase of the hilton concord hotel  we entered into amendments to our senior credit facility in february and may in order to give us greater flexibility on the related covenant tests

in february  we entered into a million  three year interest rate cap agreement in connection with the mortgage loan on the hilton concord hotel  in order to provide an economic hedge against the potential effect of future interest rate fluctuations 
the interest rate agreement caps the day libor at and is scheduled to mature on march  in march  we entered into a million  three year interest rate cap agreement related to our credit facility  in order to provide an economic hedge against the potential effect of future interest rate fluctuations 
the interest rate agreement caps the day libor at and is scheduled to mature on january  at december   the total fair value of these interest rate cap agreements was a gain of approximately  the change in fair value of these interest rate cap agreements are reflected in earnings 
giving effect to our interest rate hedging activities  a change in the day libor would have changed our interest expense by approximately   and  for the years ended december   and exchange rate risk our international operations are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we derived approximately  and of our revenues  excluding reimbursed expenses  from services performed in canada  the united kingdom  france and russia for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our foreign currency translation gains and losses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our statement of operations

therefore  we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the event that we have large transactions requiring currency conversion we would reevaluate whether we should engage in hedging activities
