item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of beverly hills bancorp inc and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this filing 
references in this filing to beverly hills bancorp inc  bhbc  the company  we  our  and us refer to beverly hills bancorp inc and our subsidiaries  unless the context indicates otherwise 
overview beverly hills bancorp inc bhbc is a financial holding company that conducts banking and lending operations in southern california and surrounding states through our bank subsidiary  first bank of beverly hills fbbh or the bank  and mortgage investment operations through our investment subsidiary  wfc inc wfc 
our business strategy is focused on the growth and profitability of fbbh through originations and purchases of commercial real estate and multifamily mortgage loans and investments in primarily aaa rated and government sponsored enterprise gse mortgage backed securities 
on september   the bank converted its charter from a federal savings and loan charter to a california state commercial bank charter  and as a result its primary regulators are the california department of financial institutions dfi and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
management believes that a state bank charter is better aligned with the bank s strategic business plan  by providing fbbh with greater flexibility in its lending operations and increased opportunities for growth 
the following discussion gives effect to the restatement of the consolidated financial statements discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  total net income for  including discontinued operations  was million  or per diluted share 
our results included a pre tax gain of million on the sale of our former loan servicing subsidiary  wilshire credit corporation wcc 
pre tax income from continuing operations  excluding the operating results of wcc and the gain on its sale  increased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  management believes that pre tax income represents a more meaningful measure of our financial results than after tax net income  as approximately million of the reported income tax expense will not be currently payable in cash due to the utilization of our net operating loss carryforward 
the year represented our first full year of operations as principally a bank holding company 
though our loan origination activity slowed substantially during as compared with  we still realized a million increase in net interest income 
this increase was the result of higher earning asset volume due primarily to significant loan originations and acquisitions in the prior year and an increase in loan prepayment fees triggered by early payoffs 
in addition  we recorded  in loan loss recaptures during the year  compared with a provision for loan losses of  for the year ended december  our other operating income increased by million from to  and total general and administrative expenses declined by million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an 
table of contents ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including  but not limited to  those related to allowances for loan losses  other than temporary impairment in the market values of investment securities and other assets  the realizability of deferred tax assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale 
the company s mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale are reported at their current fair market value 
in determining current fair value when quotes from third parties are not available  we estimate the present value of the anticipated cash flows of the securities based on certain assumptions  including the amount and timing of future repayments  the discount rate to be used  and default rates and expected losses on the loans underlying the securities 
if the change in market value is considered temporary  the unrealized holding gains and losses are reported net of tax  when applicable  as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
in the event of a decline in market value  management must evaluate whether the decline is temporary in nature or other than temporary 
in making this evaluation  management must consider certain factors  including a whether the company has the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of the fair value up to or beyond the cost of the investment  and b whether evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
declines that are considered other than temporary are reflected as market valuation losses and impairments in the consolidated statements of operations and not as a direct reduction to stockholders equity 
the company s portfolio of mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale represented approximately of consolidated total assets as of december  consequently  fluctuations in the securities values can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolios 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged against operations  recoveries of previously charged off loans  and allocations of discounts on purchased loans  and is decreased by loan charge offs 
loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
the company uses its internal asset review system to evaluate its loan portfolio and to classify loans as pass  special mention  substandard  substandard well secured  doubtful or loss 
these terms correspond to varying degrees of risk that the loans will not be collected in part or in full 
the frequency at which a specific loan is subjected to internal asset review depends on the type and size of the loan and the presence or absence of other risk factors  such as delinquency and changes in collateral values 
the allowance for loan losses consists of general valuation allowances gvas  which are derived primarily from the company s loss migration factors 
specific valuation allowances svas are established for impaired loans  and are equal to the excess of the unpaid principal balance over the fair value of the collateral for all impaired loans 
beginning in september  as a result of the bank s conversion to a state bank charter from a federal savings and loan charter  any sva allocated to a loan is charged off during the month in which the allocation was made 
gvas are based on loss migration factors that are updated each quarter 
gvas also include a qualitative adjustment  which represents management s evaluation after consideration of certain credit risk characteristics 
these risk characteristics include  but are not limited to  the following the institution s historical and recent loss experience in its portfolios  the volume  severity and trend of non performing assets  the extent to which 
table of contents refinances or loan modifications are made to maintain loans in a current status  known deterioration in credit concentrations or certain classes of loans  loan to value ratios of real estate secured loans  risks associated with specific types of collateral  the quality and effectiveness of the lending policy  loan purchase policy  internal asset review policy  charge off  collection and recovery policies  current and anticipated conditions in the general and local economies which might affect the collectability of the institution s asset  anticipated changes in the composition or volume of the loan portfolio  and reasonableness standards in accordance with regulatory agency policies 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these risk characteristics is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
apart from a qualitative adjustment  management currently maintains a risk modeling reserve in the range of to of the total estimated allowance for loan losses  due to the inherent risk associated with the imprecision in estimating the allowance 
to assess the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  the portfolio is segmented into three components impaired loans  homogeneous loans  and non homogeneous loans 
in determining which loans are impaired  the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the company s impaired loans include all loan types classified as substandard  doubtful or loss including loans which may have been upgraded but which are troubled debt restructurings 
svas are measured on a loan by loan basis utilizing either the discounted cash flow or fair market value approaches  as defined under sfas no 
homogeneous loans have been defined as loans secured by one to four single family residences  mobile home loans  and consumer loans  and are analyzed for impairment collectively by their respective loan group 
gva loss estimates are measured utilizing the company s loss migration factors 
non homogeneous loans include the following loan types multifamily  commercial real estate  bridge loans  construction loans  and commercial unsecured 
the non homogeneous loans are analyzed individually for impairment 
gva loss estimates are measured utilizing the company s loss migration factors 
a loss horizon of seven years has been developed with the objective of achieving loss data to capture a full business cycle 
when the bank increases the allowance for loan losses related to loans  it records a corresponding increase to the provision for loan losses in the statement of operations 
the dfi and fdic  as part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for losses and the carrying values of its assets 
there can be no assurance that the dfi or fdic will not require additional reserves following future examinations 
income taxes 
at december  we had a total deferred tax asset of million 
this asset represents the tax effect of future deductible or taxable amounts and is attributable to net operating loss carryforwards and also to temporary differences between amounts that have been recognized in the financial statements and amounts that have been recognized in the company s income tax returns 
in accounting for the deferred tax assets  we apply sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires  among other things  that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   we evaluated the positive and negative evidence regarding the future realization of the deferred tax assets 
pursuant to this evaluation  we concluded that the available objective positive evidence regarding our ability to generate future federal taxable income substantially outweighed the available objective negative evidence regarding future federal taxable income 
we also concluded that the objective negative evidence regarding the ability to generate certain future state taxable income outweighed the available objective positive evidence regarding certain future state taxable income  due primarily to the curtailment of our operations in the state of oregon following the sale of wcc 
as a result  we believe it is more likely than not that a 
table of contents substantial amount of our deferred tax asset will be realized in future years  and consequently  we believe  as of december   that the only valuation allowance required is approximately million related to net operating loss carryforwards in oregon and certain other states 
as portions of the deferred tax asset are realized and the valuation allowance is reduced  the related benefits  to the extent they related to our post reorganizational period  are recorded as a deferred tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
as benefits relating to our pre reorganizational period are realized  they are recorded as a direct increase to stockholders equity 
the net deferred tax asset of million is reported as an asset in our consolidated statement of financial condition as of december  however  there can be no assurance that the amount  if any  that we ultimately realize will not differ materially from our assessment 
contingencies 
we are party to various legal proceedings  as discussed previously and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these matters have a high degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings  the amounts of any related ongoing costs  and the adequacy of amounts provided for these matters 
there also can be no assurance that all matters that may be brought against us or that we may bring against other parties are known to us at any point in time 
results of operations compared to interest income a significant portion of our consolidated earnings arises from net interest income  which is the difference between interest income received and interest expense paid 
net interest income is affected by the relative amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  information regarding the total amount of our income from interest earning assets and the resulting average yields  the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  expressed in dollars and rates  and the net interest spread and net interest margin 
the interest income and expense amounts in the table below are consolidated  but reflect primarily the results of our banking operations 
information is based on monthly balances during the indicated periods 
interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities year ended december  average balance interest weighted average yield rate average balance interest weighted average yield rate average balance interest weighted average yield rate assets mortgage backed securities loans  net of unaccreted discounts unamortized premium federal funds and other investments total interest earning assets non interest earning cash allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities and stockholders equity interest bearing deposits savings  now and money market accounts certificates of deposit total interest bearing deposits repurchase agreements fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing deposits other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income net interest spread net interest margin ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities the average balances of the loan portfolio include discounted loans and non performing loans  on which interest is recognized on a cash basis 
beginning in  the company classified its prepayment fees on loans as interest income 
as a result  the company reclassified its prepayment fees on loans in and earlier periods from other operating income to interest income 
this change in classification was made pursuant to the conversion of fbbh s charter from a federal savings and loan charter to a california state commercial bank charter 
the company believes this classification of loan prepayment fees is consistent with that of other state chartered banks 
the amount of such fees included in interest income totaled million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and net interest spread represents the weighted average yield on interest earning assets minus the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by total average interest earning assets 
the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and expense during the 
table of contents periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior volume and iii total change in rate and volume 
changes attributable to both volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

increase rate increase decrease volume net change decrease increase rate increase decrease volume net change dollars in thousands interest earning assets mortgage backed securities loans federal funds and other investments total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings  now and money market accounts certificates of deposit total interest bearing deposits repurchase agreements fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities increase in net interest income our net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the net interest spread increased by basis points  from for to for  and the net interest margin increased from to for the same periods 
the increase in net interest income was due primarily to a higher loan volume in  reflecting the bank s significant loan originations and purchases throughout our average balance of interest earning assets for the year ended december  was more than billion  an increase of million over the average for the year ended december  in addition  interest income for included million in loan prepayment fees  compared with million of such fees in we previously included loan prepayment fees in other income  but reclassified them to interest income in due to the bank s conversion to a state bank charter 
the prior year results have been adjusted to conform to the current year classification 
these increases in interest income more than offset a substantial increase in our interest expense  which resulted from both a higher average balance of interest bearing liabilities and an increase in cost of funds 
the basis point increase in net interest margin from to was the result of the million increase in loan prepayment fees  partially offset by accelerated premium amortization  in excluding the effects of these loan prepayments  we experienced a compression in our net interest margin in due to the continuing rise in market interest rates and the flattening of the yield curve 
our overall cost of funds increased by basis points  from in to in  as maturing deposits and borrowings were replaced with higher costing funds 
we anticipate that the net interest margin may narrow further in future periods if interest rates continue to rise and the yield curve continues to flatten 

table of contents interest income on mortgage backed securities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in reflects a million increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities  primarily as a result of the bank s purchases of million of mortgage backed securities in the increase also was due to an increase in yield of basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the higher average yield in resulted from the increase in market interest rates  which extended the expected lives of the securities and reduced the amortization of premiums 
interest income on loans was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in was due primarily to a million increase in the average balance of loans  reflecting the bank s significant loan originations and purchases throughout the bank s loan fundings slowed during  primarily due to the increase in interest rates  which reduced the number of refinancings  and also as a result of increasing competitiveness in loan pricing 
consequently  the bank focused in on increasing its loan acquisition activity  and purchased an aggregate of million unpaid principal balance of multifamily and commercial loans during the year 
these purchases included one multifamily loan portfolio consisting of loans with a total unpaid principal balance of million  and another portfolio of four loans totaling million 
at december   the bank s pipeline of loans in process totaled million 
our increase in loan interest income also reflects a basis point increase in yield  from for to for this increase was due to primarily to the rise in interest rates during the year but also reflects the increase in prepayment fees  net of accelerated premium amortization  in over interest expense on deposits  consisting primarily of certificates of deposit  was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher market interest rates in this increase in rates raised the cost of interest bearing deposits by basis points  from for to for interest expense on repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank fhlb advances totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  these increases were due primarily to a significant increase in the average balance of outstanding borrowings 
in the latter half of the bank began to utilize its debt facilities in lieu of certificates of deposit to finance its asset growth 
the increase in interest on borrowings also reflects the recent increases in market interest rates  which raised the average cost of repurchase agreements by basis points from to similarly  the cost of fhlb advances increased by basis points  from an average of for to for provision for loan losses in  the bank recorded  in net recaptures of loan loss provisions previously taken 
for the year ended december   the bank recorded a loan loss provision of  wfc recorded a net loan loss provision of  for the year ended december   compared with net recaptures of  for the year ended december  the credit quality of our assets is affected by many factors beyond our control  including local and national economic conditions  and the possible existence of facts which are not known to us which adversely affect the likelihood of repayment of various loans in our loan portfolio and realization of the collateral upon a default 
accordingly  we can give no assurance that we will not sustain loan losses materially in excess of the allowance for loan losses 
gain on sale of securities we realized a net gain of  on sales of million in mortgage backed securities for the year ended december  there was no such sales activity during 
table of contents net gains on sales of securities are generated primarily in declining interest rate environments 
accordingly  gains or losses from sales of securities may fluctuate significantly from period to period  and the results in any period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be attained in future periods 
other expenses compensation and employee benefits expense totaled million for the years ended december  and our base employee compensation  primarily salaries and wages  increased by million from to  due to an increase in the bank s lending staff and the opening of the bank s new calabasas branch 
this increase was offset by a million decline in incentive compensation  as a result of a decline in loan fundings in as compared with our legal expenses included in professional fees in the statement of operations increased by million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to expenses related to various ongoing issues with respect to a former officer see item legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that this litigation will be concluded in the second quarter of other professional fees  particularly audit and consulting expenses  were higher in primarily as a result of expenses related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley section occupancy expense increased slightly from to as a result of the renewal of the lease at our calabasas offices  effective in august the decline in fdic insurance premiums in reflects an overall decline in our deposits from mid  when we began to utilize borrowings as our primary funding source  to the third quarter of the increase in deposits in the fourth quarter of may result in higher fdic premiums in future periods 
our amortization expense represents the amortization recorded on our core deposit intangible asset  which we acquired in connection with our purchase of a branch in june as of june   the core deposit intangible asset had been amortized in full and no longer had a book value  and as a result  we do not expect to incur such amortization expense in future periods 
our directors expense declined from to  primarily due to the reduction in the size of our board of directors from ten members to seven in august provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes was million for  compared with income taxes on continuing operations of million as restated for the unusually low tax expense for was due to the elimination of nearly all of the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of a portion of the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets primarily net operating losses that were generated in the company s post reorganizational period  and the related benefit was recorded as a deferred tax benefit in our statement of operations 
the majority of the deferred tax assets that were realized were generated in our pre reorganizational period  and the related tax benefits were realized by recording a direct increase to stockholders equity 
our tax provision primarily reflects the current statutory income tax rates 
however  approximately million of this expense is not expected to be currently payable in cash due to the utilization of our net operating loss carryforward 
changes in financial condition general at december   our total assets were billion  an increase of million  or  over the total as of december  this asset growth was due to increases in our loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios  which were funded primarily with new fhlb advances and certificates of deposit 
the following discussion summarizes the significant changes in our financial condition for the year ended december  
table of contents mortgage backed and other investment securities available for sale our portfolio of mortgage backed securities available for sale increased by million during the year ended december  during we purchased a total of million of primarily aaa rated mortgage backed securities with a weighted average yield of 
these purchases were offset by principal repayments of million and unrealized holding losses of million  as a result of the continuing rise in interest rates during the year 
we did not engage in any sales of securities in due to the decline in loan origination activity during the year 
in addition  gains on such sales are generated primarily in declining interest rate environments 
the balance of our other investment securities available for sale consisting of trust preferred securities and mutual funds was substantially the same at december  and december   reflecting minimal unrealized holding losses 
loans our portfolio of loans  net of discounts and allowances  increased by million in this increase was due to loan purchases of million and loan originations of million  offset by repayments of million 
our loan originations declined substantially in as compared with the million in originations in this decrease in origination activity was primarily a result of the increase in interest rates  which reduced the number and amount of refinancings  and also due to increasing competitiveness in loan pricing 
as a result  we achieved our portfolio growth in primarily through loan purchases  including acquisitions of multifamily loan portfolios totaling million in june and million in october discounted loans  net our discounted loans  net  consist of wfc s portfolio of discounted loans 
prior to september   wfc conducted its loan investment and portfolio management operations with an institutional investor  which had participation interests in the returns generated by the assets serving as collateral for the loans 
the carrying value of wfc s discounted loans then was reported net of the co investor s interest 
effective september   wfc acquired a interest in the returns generated by those portfolios  resulting in an increase in carrying value of million 
this increase was offset by  in loan principal repayments during the year 
real estate owned real estate owned decreased by million for the year ended december  in the first quarter of  we completed sales of four properties with an aggregate carrying value of million for a net gain of  these sales were partially offset by acquisitions of  in properties through new foreclosures 
deposits deposits increased by million during the year ended december   due primarily to an increase in brokered certificates of deposit and the opening of our new branch in calabasas 
the weighted average interest cost of the bank s total deposit balance was at december   compared with at december  this increase resulted primarily from two factors the increase in market interest rates in caused maturing deposits to be replaced with higher costing new deposits  and certificates of deposit as a share of total deposits increased from at december  to at december  the bank s deposits at december  and included million and million  respectively  of balances held by bhbc and wfc 
these deposits are eliminated in consolidation and are not reflected in total deposits on our consolidated statements of financial condition 

table of contents repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements decreased by million for the year ended december   as a result of repayments of million  partially offset by new repurchase agreements totaling million 
at december   we had total repurchase agreements of million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of  compared with the december  weighted average cost of 
these borrowings are used primarily to finance the bank s lending and investment activities 
fhlb advances 
fhlb advances increased by million in  as a result of million in new advances  offset by maturities of million 
this increase occurred primarily in june  as we obtained million in new advances to fund loan acquisitions and to replace maturing advances 
as discussed above  we have utilized fhlb advances as our primary funding source after receiving bhbc s deposit of the proceeds from the sale of wcc 
at december   we had total fhlb advances of million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of  compared with the december  weighted average cost of 
the fhlb has authorized a borrowing limit for the bank s total fhlb advances of of the bank s total assets as of the previous quarter end 
stockholders equity 
our stockholders equity increased by million during the year ended december   to million  or book value per diluted share 
this increase reflects our net income of million   from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options  a  tax benefit from the exercise of non qualified stock options  and  in deferred tax benefits relating to our pre reorganization period 
these increases were partially offset by cash dividends of million on common stock and net after tax unrealized losses of million on our portfolio of available for sale securities 
off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business 
these financial instruments include debt obligations and commitments to extend credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
at december  and we had outstanding million in floating rate junior subordinated notes payable to a wholly owned statutory business trust 
the notes bear interest at the three month libor rate plus at december  and mature in these notes and their related terms are discussed in further detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  and  we had outstanding commitments to extend credit of million and million  respectively 
these commitments expose us to credit risk in excess of amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
we receive collateral to support loans and commitments to extend credit for which collateral is deemed necessary 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of an entity s ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  originate loans  fund investments  purchase pools of loans  and make payments for general business purposes 
the bank s sources of liquidity include wholesale and retail deposits  fhlb advances up to of the bank s total assets as of the previous quarter end  repurchase agreements  whole loan and mortgage backed securities sales  and net interest income 
wfc s sources of liquidity consist of net interest income and repayments on its portfolio of discounted loans and mortgage backed securities 
we manage our liquidity on a daily basis  and the company s board of directors periodically reviews our liquidity 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our operating needs 
based on our current and expected asset size  capital levels  and organizational infrastructure  we believe there will be sufficient available liquidity to meet our operating needs 

table of contents at december   the bank had million of certificates of deposit 
scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit during the months ending december  and thereafter amounted to million and million  respectively 
wholesale deposits generally are more responsive to changes in interest rates than core deposits  and thus are more likely to be withdrawn by the investor upon maturity as changes in interest rates and other factors are perceived by investors to make other investments more attractive 
management continues its effort to reduce the bank s exposure to interest rate changes by utilizing funding sources whose repricing characteristics more closely match those of the bank s interest earning assets 
the company is party to various contractual financial obligations  including repayment of borrowings  operating lease payments and commitments to extend credit 
the table below presents the company s future financial obligations outstanding as of december  contractual obligations payments due within time period at december  months years years after years total dollars in thousands certificates of deposit repurchase agreements employment contracts operating leases fhlb advances junior subordinated notes payable to trust commitments to originate loans total with the exception of the operating leases and loan commitments  the expected obligations presented above include anticipated interest accruals based on the current respective contractual terms 
the amounts for the junior subordinated debentures are based on the assumption that the debentures will be repaid in full at maturity in july however  commencing july   the debentures may be repaid in full or in part at par 
dfi regulations require each california chartered bank to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operation 
it is the bank s responsibility to establish a liquidity policy that sets minimum liquidity requirements 
as of december   the bank was in compliance with its liquidity policy 

table of contents regulatory capital requirements bank holding companies  such as bhbc  and fdic insured banks  such as fbbh  are required to meet certain minimum regulatory capital requirements 
at december   bhbc and fbbh met all applicable regulatory capital requirements and fbbh was well capitalized  as defined under applicable regulations

results of operations compared to through april   prior to the sale of wcc  beverly hills bancorp inc  then known as wilshire financial services group inc  conducted operations in three principal business segments community banking operations referred to herein as our banking operations through fbbh  specialized mortgage loan servicing operations through wcc  and mortgage investment operations through wfc 
accordingly  the discussion in this section includes separate discussions of the results of operations for each business segment 
consolidated results our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our income from continuing operations  excluding the gain on the sale of wcc and wcc s income prior to its sale  was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared with million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our income before taxes from continuing operations was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  management believes that pre tax income represents a more meaningful measure of our financial results than after tax net income  as a substantial portion of the reported income tax expense will not be currently payable in cash as a result of the utilization of our net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and an additional deduction for the exercise of nonqualified stock options 

table of contents our stockholders equity increased by million during the year ended december  to million  or book value per diluted share 
much of this increase related to certain tax benefits that were realized during  as discussed in further detail below 
in addition  the increase reflects our net income for the year including the gain on the sale of wcc  the issuance of million in common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options and a million tax benefit from the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
these increases were partially offset by million in cash dividends on our common stock and net after tax unrealized losses of million on our portfolio of available for sale securities and hedging instruments 
the company realized significant tax benefits in which directly impacted stockholders equity 
as of december   we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets in future years 
consequently  we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance applicable to our consolidated deferred tax asset of million 
since these deferred tax benefits relate to losses generated prior to our reorganization  their recognition was recorded as a direct increase to stockholders equity  and not as a reduction to income tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the increase in income from continuing operations in as compared with was due primarily to the following factors net interest income increased by million  reflecting significant lending and investment activity  as well as a higher net interest margin and spread  at our banking subsidiary  fbbh  other income increased by  due primarily to an increase in fhlb stock dividends and the absence of market impairment charges in  and consolidated operating expenses declined by million  primarily as a result of a million decrease in our legal costs for the defense of former executives and a decrease in loan servicing expenses following the transfer of servicing duties on the bank s loan portfolio from wcc to the bank effective january these decreases were partially offset by  in auditing and consulting expenses related to the implementation of sarbanes oxley section these above factors were partially offset by a loan loss provision of  in  as compared with loan loss recaptures of  in following is a discussion of the operating results of the company s banking operations and mortgage investment operations segments  and its discontinued loan servicing operations

upon such a determination  those loans are placed on non accrual status and deemed to be non performing 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed by a charge to interest income 
interest income on loans includes loan fees of and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the bank s net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the net interest spread increased by basis points  from in to in  and the net interest margin increased from to for the same periods 
the increase in net interest income in was primarily attributable to the bank s significant loan originations and purchases of investment securities in and in late  utilizing new deposits and low cost borrowings as funding sources 
in addition  the prevailing low interest rate environment has continued to impact the bank s interest bearing liabilities to a greater extent than its interest earning assets  as indicated by the higher spreads and margins in the bank s overall cost of funds declined by basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in contrast  the bank s average yield on its interest earning assets declined by only basis points  from for to for the bank s interest income on mortgage backed and other investment securities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase 
table of contents in was due to an increase in the average investment balance  primarily as a result of the bank s purchases of million of mortgage backed and other investment securities in  in addition to significant purchases in the latter half of as a result of the recent rise in market interest rates  the bank s yield for increased by one basis point over the yield for the recent slight increases in market rates of interest also have resulted in a slowing of the prepayment rates on these securities in as compared with the bank s interest income on loans was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a million increase in the average loan balance in  which resulted from both higher loan originations and a slowing of prepayments as compared with the prior year 
the bank s originations and purchases totaled million in  compared with million in  and its loan repayments declined by nearly million in despite the larger portfolio 
this increase in average loan volume was partially offset by a basis point decline in average yield  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the lower yield in reflected both a decline in market yields and lower prepayment fees received during the year 
fbbh s interest expense on deposits totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in resulted from a significant increase in the average deposit balance  as the bank raised new brokered certificates of deposit in late and early to finance its loan originations and purchases 
the bank subsequently permitted the run off of its certificates of deposit and began to utilize short term borrowings and fhlb advances to finance its asset acquisitions 
the higher average deposit volume in was largely offset by a decline in cost of basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the bank s interest expense on borrowings for the year ended december  was million  compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a significant increase in the average balance of outstanding borrowings 
beginning in the second quarter of  the bank  after receiving a deposit of million from bhbc representing primarily the gross proceeds from the sale of wcc  increasingly utilized advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb and repurchase agreements as its primary funding source in lieu of higher costing certificates of deposit 
in august  the fhlb raised the bank s authorized borrowing limit from to of the bank s total assets as of the previous quarter end 
these increases in the average borrowing balance were partially offset by a decline in the cost of borrowings of basis points  from for to for provision for loan losses based on its quarterly evaluations of the adequacy of its loan loss reserves  the bank recorded a provision for loan losses of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the bank recaptured  of loan loss reserves  primarily as a result of the sale of its performing mobile home loan portfolio in june gain on sales of securities  net the bank realized gains totaling  on sales of million of mortgage backed and other investment securities in for the year ended december   the bank s realized gains totaled  on sales of million of mortgage backed securities

table of contents compensation and employee benefits expense the bank s compensation and employee benefits expense totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in reflects an increase in incentive compensation  primarily as a result of the high level of loan fundings in as compared with the prior year 
other expenses the bank s other expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this decrease was largely due to the transfer of the servicing duties on the bank s loan portfolio from wcc to the bank beginning january  as a result  the bank no longer pays a fee to wcc for servicing a majority of its loan portfolio  resulting in a  decline in loan expenses 
the decrease in the bank s other expenses in also reflects the accrual of  of settlement costs in december in connection with litigation related to the bank s sale of its bankcard operations in june the bank s audit expenses declined by  in as a result of the allocation of costs related to sarbanes oxley section to the holding company 
in addition  depreciation expense declined by  as many of the bank s leasehold improvements became fully depreciated as of august   when the original lease at its calabasas  california offices expired 
these decreases were partially offset by slight increases in other expense categories 
the bank incurred higher professional fees in as a result of consulting fees incurred in its conversion to an in house loan servicing system

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk managing risk is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company 
the most prominent risk exposures are credit quality  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
credit quality risk is the risk of not collecting interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as the result of changes in interest rates 
rate movements can affect the repricing of assets and liabilities differently  as well as their market values  and also can affect the ability of the borrower to repay 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  investors and borrowers 
asset and liability management it is our objective to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to limit our exposure to earnings volatility and variations in the value of assets and 
table of contents liabilities as interest rates change over time 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset and liability committees of the company and of the board of directors collectively  alco which reviews  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses including those attributable to hedging transactions  purchase activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
alco establishes rate sensitivity tolerances within regulatory guidelines which are approved by our board of directors  and coordinates with our board with respect to overall asset and liability composition 
alco is authorized to utilize off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
these techniques include interest rate swap agreements  pursuant to which the parties exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest payments on a specified principal amount referred to as the notional amount for a specified period without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
we continually monitor the interest rate sensitivity of our portfolios of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities in conjunction with the current interest rate environment 
when new pools of loans or securities are acquired  we will assess the incremental change in our sensitivity to interest rates  and determine accordingly whether or not to hedge 
in addition  alco also regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on the interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value npv  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
alco further evaluates such impacts against the maximum tolerable change in interest income that is authorized by our board of directors 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in the company s net portfolio value at december   should interest rates increase or decrease by to basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
interest rate sensitivity of net portfolio value net portfolio value npv as of assets amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands change in rates bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp bp   bp bp  bp bp   bp in determining net portfolio value  we make various assumptions  including  but not limited to  prepayment speeds on the company s assets and the discount rates to be used 
we review our assumptions regularly and adjust them when it is deemed appropriate based on current and future expected market conditions 
we believe that the assumptions including prepayment assumptions we use to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and consider them reasonable 
however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 

table of contents another tool used to identify and manage our interest rate risk profile is the static gap analysis 
interest sensitivity gap analysis measures the difference between the assets and liabilities repricing or maturing within specific time periods 
the following table summarizes the scheduled maturities or repricing of the bank s assets and liabilities based on their contractual terms as of december  within twelve months more than one year to three years more than three years to five years over five years total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from banks mortgage backed and other investment securities single family residential loans multifamily residential loans commercial real estate loans consumer and other loans other assets total assets liabilities demand deposits now and money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit repurchase agreements fhlb advances other liabilities total liabilities deficiency excess of assets over liabilities cumulative deficiency excess cumulative deficiency excess as a percent of total assets includes unamortized premium on loans and allowance for loan losses
