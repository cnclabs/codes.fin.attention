item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contain disclosures which are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts  and can be identified by the use of words such as may  will  expect  project  estimate  anticipate  plan  believe  potential  should  continue or the negative versions of those words or other comparable words 
these forward looking statements are based upon our current plans or expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks that could significantly affect current plans  anticipated actions and our future financial condition and results 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance  and we have no specific intention to update these statements 
the uncertainties and risks include  but are not limited to risks relating to our insurance operating units such as significant weather related or other natural or human made catastrophes and disasters  the cyclical nature of the property and casualty industry  the long tail and potentially volatile nature of certain casualty lines of business written by our insurance operating units  the availability of reinsurance  exposure to terrorist acts  the willingness and ability of our insurance operating units reinsurers to pay reinsurance recoverables owed to them  changes in the ratings assigned to our insurance operating units  claims development and the process of estimating reserves  legal and regulatory changes  the uncertain nature of damage theories and loss amounts  increases in the levels of risk retention by our insurance operating units  and adverse loss development for events insured by our insurance operating units in either the current year or prior year 
additional risks and uncertainties include general economic and political conditions  including the effects of a prolonged us or global economic downturn or recession  changes in costs  variations in political  economic or other factors  risks relating to conducting operations in a competitive environment  effects of acquisition and disposition activities  inflation rates or recessionary or expansive trends  changes in market prices of our significant equity investments  extended labor disruptions  civil unrest or other external factors over which we have no control  and changes in our plans  strategies  objectives  expectations or intentions  which may happen at any time at our discretion 
as a consequence  current plans  anticipated actions and future financial condition and results may differ from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
critical accounting estimates losses and lae each of our insurance operating units establishes reserves on its balance sheet for unpaid losses and lae related to its property and casualty insurance and surety and fidelity contracts 
as of any balance sheet date  historically there have been claims that have not yet been reported  and some claims may not be reported for many years after the date a loss 
table of contents occurs 
as a result of this historical pattern  the liability for unpaid losses and lae includes significant estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported  known as ibnr 
additionally  reported claims are in various stages of the settlement process 
each claim is settled individually based upon its merits  and certain claims may take years to settle  especially if legal action is involved 
as a result  the liabilities for unpaid losses and lae include significant judgments  assumptions and estimates made by management relating to the ultimate losses that will arise from the claims 
due to the inherent uncertainties in the process of establishing these liabilities  the actual ultimate loss from a claim is likely to differ  perhaps materially  from the liability initially recorded and could be material to the results of our operations 
the accounting policies that our insurance operating units use in connection with the establishment of these liabilities include critical accounting estimates 
our insurance operating units use a variety of techniques that employ significant judgments and assumptions to establish the liabilities for unpaid losses and lae recorded at the balance sheet date 
these techniques include detailed statistical analyses of past claim reporting  settlement activity  claim frequency  internal loss experience  changes in pricing or coverages and severity data when sufficient information exists to lend statistical credibility to the analysis 
more subjective techniques are used when statistical data is insufficient or unavailable 
these liabilities also reflect implicit or explicit assumptions regarding the potential effects of future inflation  judicial decisions  changes in laws and recent trends in such factors as well as a number of actuarial assumptions that vary across our insurance operating units and across lines of business 
this data is analyzed by line of business  coverage and accident year  as appropriate 
as noted above  as of any balance sheet date  not all claims that have occurred have been reported to our insurance operating units  and if reported may not have been settled 
the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the time it is settled by the insurer is referred to as the claim tail 
property claims usually have a fairly short claim tail and  absent claim litigation  are reported and settled within no more than a few years of the date they are reported 
for short tail lines  the process of recording quarterly and annual liabilities for unpaid losses and lae is primarily focused on maintaining an appropriate reserve level for reported claims and ibnr  rather than determining an expected loss ratio for the current business 
our insurance operating units provide coverage on both a claims made and occurrence basis 
claims made policies generally require that claims occur and be reported during the coverage period of the policy 
occurrence policies allow claims which occur during a policy s coverage period to be reported after the coverage period  and as a result  these claims can have a very long claim tail  occasionally extending for decades 
in conformity with gaap  our insurance operating units are not permitted to establish ibnr reserves for catastrophe losses that have not occurred 
therefore  losses related to a significant catastrophe or accumulation of catastrophes in any reporting period could have a material  negative impact on our results during that period 
casualty claims can have a very long claim tail  in certain situations extending for many years 
in addition  casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and the legal environment and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations  all of which contribute to extending the claim tail 
for long tail casualty lines of business  estimation of ultimate liabilities for unpaid losses and lae is a more complex process and depends on a number of factors  including the line and volume of the business involved 
for these reasons  aihl s insurance operating units will generally use actuarial projections in setting reserves for all casualty lines of business 
our loss reserve review processes use actuarial methods and underlying assumptions that vary by company and line of business and produce ranges from which the carried reserve for each class of business is selected 
the actuarial methods used by our insurance operating units include the incurred development method  paid development method  bornhuetter 
table of contents ferguson method for both paid and incurred  balanced incurred method and ultimate incurred times ultimate claims method 
because of the high level of uncertainty regarding the setting of liabilities for unpaid losses and lae  it is the practice of each of our insurance operating units to engage  at least annually  an outside actuary to evaluate  and opine on  the reasonableness of these liabilities 
although we are unable at this time to determine whether additional reserves  which could have a material impact upon our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  may be necessary in the future  we believe that the reserves for unpaid losses and lae established by our insurance operating units are adequate as of december  our reserve for unpaid losses and lae includes million of gross and net reserves at december  and million of gross and net reserves at december   for various liability coverages related to asbestos and environmental impairment claims that arose from reinsurance assumed by a subsidiary of cata between and the subsidiary exited this business in reserves for asbestos and environmental impairment claims cannot be estimated with traditional loss reserving techniques because of uncertainties that are greater than those associated with other types of claims 
factors contributing to these uncertainties include a lack of historical data  the significant periods of time that often elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss and the reporting of that loss to the ceding company and the reinsurer  uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure to these risks  unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage and the extent and timing of any such contractual liability 
loss reserve estimates for these environmental impairment and asbestos exposures include case reserves  which also reflect reserves for legal and other lae and ibnr reserves 
ibnr reserves are determined based upon cata s historic general liability exposure base and policy language  previous environmental impairment loss experience and the assessment of current trends of environmental law  environmental cleanup costs  asbestos liability law and judgmental settlements of asbestos liabilities 
for both asbestos and environmental impairment reinsurance claims  cata establishes case reserves by receiving case reserve amounts from its ceding companies and verifies these amounts against reinsurance contract terms  analyzing from the first dollar of loss incurred by the primary insurer 
in establishing the liability for asbestos and environmental impairment claims  cata considers facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation 
additionally  ceding companies often report potential losses on a precautionary basis to protect their rights under the reinsurance arrangement  which generally calls for prompt notice to the reinsurer 
ceding companies  at the time they report potential losses  advise cata of the ceding companies current estimate of the extent of the loss 
cata s claims department reviews each of the precautionary claims notices and  based upon current information  assesses the likelihood of loss to cata 
this assessment is one of the factors used in determining the adequacy of the recorded asbestos and environmental impairment reserves 
although we are unable at this time to determine whether additional reserves  which could have a material impact upon our results of operations  may be necessary in the future  we believe that cata s asbestos and environmental impairment reserves are adequate as of december  our insurance operating units continually evaluate the potential for changes  both positive and negative  in their estimates of these liabilities and use the results of these evaluations to adjust both recorded liabilities and underwriting criteria 
with respect to liabilities for unpaid losses and lae established in prior years  these liabilities are periodically analyzed and their expected ultimate cost adjusted  where necessary  to reflect positive or negative development in loss experience and new information  including  for certain catastrophic events  revised industry estimates of the magnitude of a catastrophe 
adjustments to previously recorded 
table of contents liabilities for unpaid losses and lae  both positive and negative  are reflected in our financial results in the periods in which these adjustments are made and are referred to as prior year reserve development 
additional information regarding prior year loss reserve development during the three year period ended december  is included on pages through of this form k report 
receivables recorded with respect to claims ceded by our insurance operating units to reinsurers under reinsurance contracts are estimated in a manner similar to liabilities for unpaid losses and  therefore  are also subject to a significant degree of uncertainty 
in addition to the factors cited above  reinsurance receivables may prove uncollectible if the reinsurer is unable to perform under the contract 
reinsurance contracts purchased by our insurance operating units do not relieve them of their obligations to their own policyholders 
additional information regarding the use of  and risks related to  the use of reinsurance by our insurance operating units can be found on pages through and pages and of this form k report 
investments we hold our equity and debt securities as available for sale  and as such  these securities are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
we complete a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether the decline in the fair value of any investment below cost is other than temporary 
all securities with an unrealized loss are reviewed  taking into account considerations including the persistence and magnitude of the decline of the issuer  issuer specific financial conditions rather than general market or industry conditions and extraordinary events including negative news releases and rating agency downgrades 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary is charged to earnings based on the fair value of the security at the time of assessment  resulting in a new cost basis for the security 
risks and uncertainties are inherent in the methodology we use to assess other than temporary declines in value 
risks and uncertainties could include  but are not limited to  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about financial condition  liquidity or future prospects  inadequacy of any underlying collateral and unfavorable changes in economic or social conditions  interest rates or credit ratings 
goodwill and other intangible assets our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill and other intangible assets  net of amortization  of approximately million 
this amount has been recorded as a result of business acquisitions 
goodwill and other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment 
we completed the annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of based upon results of operations through september  and determined that there was no indication of impairment 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill and other intangible assets impairment tests 
these tests include estimating the fair value of our operating units and other intangible assets 
with respect to goodwill  as required by statement no 
 we compare the estimated fair value of our operating units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill 
under statement no 
 fair value refers to the amount for which the entire operating unit may be bought or sold 
our methods for estimating operating unit values include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
all of these methods involve significant estimates and assumptions 
deferred taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return with our subsidiaries 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences 
table of contents between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
at december  a net deferred tax asset of million was recorded  including a valuation allowance of million for certain foreign tax credits and deferred state tax assets which we believe may not be realized 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this determination is based upon a review of anticipated future earnings as well as all available evidence  both positive and negative 
deferred tax liabilities at december  were million 
in addition to the policies described above which contain critical accounting estimates  our other accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this form k report 
the accounting policies described in note require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities but do not meet the level of materiality required for a determination that the accounting policy includes critical accounting estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the value of long lived assets  deferred acquisition costs  incentive compensation  pension benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the increase in net premiums earned in from primarily reflects growth in all lines of darwin s business  growth in cata s property and casualty lines including in excess and surplus markets and commercial surety lines and lower reinsurance costs at cata 
the increases at darwin and cata were partially offset by a decrease in net premiums earned at rsui 
the increase in net premiums earned in from reflects the benefit from rsui s first full year of operations as part of the aihl group of companies 
the increase in interest  dividend and other income during the three year period ended december  reflects a greater amount of invested assets and higher investment yields 
the increase in costs and expenses over the three year period ended december  primarily reflects a substantial increase in loss and lae attributable to significant hurricane activity in and  as well as growth of business with commissions and brokerage expenses keeping pace with the increases in net premiums earned and the costs incurred in building darwin s organization and transitioning rsui from a managing agency to an integrated insurance company 
the significant increase in loss and lae in from is primarily attributable to the million of pre tax catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance  incurred by rsui as a result of the substantially more significant hurricane activity in the significant increase in loss and lae in from is attributable to the million of pre tax catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance  incurred by rsui as a result of hurricane activity 
corporate administration expenses decreased percent in from  primarily reflecting a decrease in parent level pension plan costs and reductions in legal and consulting expenditures 
corporate administration expenses increased percent in from  which was primarily attributable to increased expense for stock based incentive compensation due to a significant increase in the market price of alleghany s common stock from at december  to at december  and a restricted stock award granted in connection with the employment of a senior officer 
the fluctuations in interest expense in the three year period ended december  are attributable to the impact of interest rate changes on million of floating rate notes due of our financing subsidiary alleghany funding corporation 
the comparative contributions to our pre tax earnings from continuing operations made by aihl  corporate activities at the parent level and discontinued operations of world minerals  which we sold in july  and heads threads  which we sold in december  were as follows in millions except for per share amounts

the results reflect a significant increase in the contribution made by aihl  which benefited from rsui s first full year of operations as part of the aihl group of companies 
rsui posted strong underwriting results and a substantial increase in net gains on investment transactions in these benefits were partially offset by the catastrophe losses incurred at rsui caused by the hurricane activity 
the contributions of aihl s insurance operating units  however  were not sufficient to make up for the loss from the continuing operations before income taxes of corporate activities  caused by the near absence of net gains on investment transactions at the parent company level in by comparison  million shares of

underwriting profit loss does not replace net income loss determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of profitability  rather  we believe that underwriting profit loss  which does not include interest  dividend and other income or net gains on investments transactions  enhances the understanding of aihl s insurance operating units operating results by highlighting net income attributable to their underwriting performance 
with the addition of interest  dividend and other income and net gains on investment transactions  reported pre tax net income a gaap measure may show a profit despite an underlying underwriting loss

the reinsurance recoveries for hurricane katrina anticipate the full utilization of rsui s catastrophe reinsurance program and significant utilization of the occurrence limits of its surplus share and per risk reinsurance treaties 
as a result  should hurricane katrina s losses prove to be greater than currently estimated  rsui would not have reinsurance coverage under its catastrophe program or significant reinsurance coverage under its other reinsurance programs available for additional loss amounts

as ric did not possess all necessary licenses to be able to write business on an admitted basis in most states at the time of acquisition  the seller of ric agreed to provide policy issuing services to ric through june under this arrangement and in respect of the unearned premiums acquired with rsui  ric assumed the policies and the related premiums net of reinsurance paid by the seller  from the seller by reinsuring the obligations of the seller s carrier under the policy 
rsui s net premiums earned decreased slightly in from primarily due to a decrease in the amount of gross premiums written in rsui s property line of business  as well as an increase in ceded premiums paid to reinsurers under rsui s catastrophe reinsurance program including reinsurance reinstatement premiums 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in net premiums earned across all other lines of business  primarily reflecting increased retentions due to changes in rsui s reinsurance structure and an increase in gross premiums written 
the significant increase in loss and lae in from primarily reflects million of pre tax catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance  due to the hurricanes 
the significant increase in loss and lae in from primarily reflects million of pre tax catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance  due to the hurricanes  as well as a full year of operations in this increase was partially offset by an million decrease in property loss reserves due to better than expected loss emergence in the accident year 
rsui s underwriting expense increased in from due to the absence of profit sharing payments under rsui s property surplus share treaties  a million reversal of profit sharing payments under these treaties and a decrease in incentive compensation accruals 
rsui s underwriting expense is reduced by commissions that it receives under its reinsurance treaties for ceding premiums to the reinsurers 
these payments recognize and offset expenses incurred by rsui in underwriting and administering the ceded business 
rsui s property surplus share treaties provide for profit sharing payments by the reinsurers based upon underwriting results of the ceded business 
in and  these profit sharing accruals reduced underwriting expense by million and million  respectively 
as a result of the and hurricanes  the underwriting results of the property surplus share reinsurance treaties deteriorated to a point where the profit sharing payments earned in and collected in were eliminated  resulting in a return of million of these payments 
in view of the catastrophe losses  rsui does not expect to have the benefit in of any profit sharing under the property surplus share treaties 
rsui s underwriting expense in and  in addition to profit sharing accruals in these years  reflects amortization of the cost of the unearned premiums acquired with rsui in the amount of million in and million in rates at rsui in as compared with continued to reflect overall industry trends  with flat or marginally decreased rates in rsui s casualty lines of business except for 
table of contents professional liability which experienced modest increases in rates and decreased rates in its property lines of business primarily due to increased competition 
in the fourth quarter  rates in property lines of business  particularly for coastal property risks  increased from the third quarter 
if rates continue to soften in our casualty lines of business  rsui may write lower levels of gross premiums written in casualty lines during  since rsui is expected to write less business when it considers prices inadequate to support acceptable profit margins 
capitol transamerica corporation cata s million underwriting profit in primarily reflects favorable loss experience in the accident year and a million pre tax release of prior year loss reserves in compared with million of adverse development in prior year loss reserves in due to lower actual loss emergence for commercial and contract surety claims

years ended december  in thousands interest  dividend and other income net gain on investment transactions the increase in interest  dividend and other income at aihl in and primarily reflects the impact of higher interest rates and a larger invested asset base principally due to capital contributions by us  increased premium volume and the acquisition of rsui in aihl s net gain on investment transactions primarily reflects the sale of  shares of cigna  for aggregate cash proceeds of million 
aihl s net gain on investment transactions primarily reflects the sale of million shares of common stock of cigna  for aggregate cash proceeds of million  while its pre tax net gain on investment transactions primarily reflects the sale of million shares of common stock of burlington northern for aggregate cash proceeds of million 
these dispositions were made primarily to diversify the investment portfolios of aihl s operating units 
investment strategy 
aihl s investment strategy seeks to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while trying to maximize its risk adjusted  after tax rate of return 
investment decisions are guided mainly by the nature and timing of expected liability payouts  management s forecast of cash flows and the possibility of unexpected cash demands  for example  to satisfy claims due to catastrophic losses 
aihl s investment portfolio currently 
table of contents consists mainly of highly rated and liquid debt securities and equity securities listed on national securities exchanges 
aihl s debt securities portfolio has been designed to enable management to react to investment opportunities created by changing interest rates  prepayments  tax and credit considerations or other factors  or to circumstances that could result in a mismatch between the desired duration of portfolio assets and the duration of liabilities  and  as such  is classified as available for sale 
despite significant catastrophe losses in and  aihl produced positive cash flow from continuing operations each quarter during the years ended december  and aihl s positive cash flow from continuing operations reduces the need to liquidate portions of its debt securities portfolio to pay for current claims 
this positive cash flow also permits aihl  as attractive investment opportunities arise  to make investments in debt securities that have a longer duration than aihl liabilities 
this strategy  when used  is designed to grow aihl s capital resources 
when attractive investment opportunities do not arise  aihl may maintain higher proportions of shorter duration securities to preserve its capital resources 
in this regard  as of december  aihl held approximately million  or percent of its debt securities portfolio  in securities with maturities of five years or less and approximately million of short term investments 
aihl anticipates modestly increasing the proportion of its debt securities portfolio held in securities with maturities of more than five years should the yields of these securities provide sufficient compensation for their increased risk 
we do not believe that this strategy would reduce aihl s ability to meet ongoing claim payments or to respond to further significant catastrophe losses 
in the event paid losses accelerate beyond the ability of aihl s insurance operating units to fund these paid losses from current cash balances  current operating cash flow  coupon receipts and security maturities  aihl would need to liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio  receive capital contributions from us and or arrange for financing 
strains on liquidity could result from the occurrence of several significant catastrophic events in a relatively short period of time  the sale of investments to fund these paid losses into a depressed marketplace  the uncollectibility of reinsurance recoverables on these paid losses  the significant decrease in the value of collateral supporting these reinsurance recoverables or a significant reduction in our net premium collections 
while the majority of aihl s investment holdings are denominated in us dollars  investments may be made in other currency denominations depending upon investment opportunities in those currencies  or as may be required by regulation or law 
aihl s investment guidelines require compliance with applicable local regulations and laws 
investment position summary 
the following tables summarize the investments of aihl and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis  excluding cash  as of december  and  with all investments carried at fair value in thousands  except for percentages 
table of contents investments december  amortized cost or cost fair value amount percentage amount percentage short term investments corporate bonds united states government and government agency bonds mortgage and asset backed securities municipal bonds foreign bonds equity securities total december  amortized cost or cost fair value amount percentage amount percentage short term investments corporate bonds united states government and government agency bonds mortgage and asset backed securities municipal bonds foreign bonds equity securities total aihl continually monitors the difference between cost and the estimated fair value of its investments  which involves uncertainty as to whether declines in value are temporary in nature 
if aihl believes a decline in the value of a particular investment is temporary  it records the decline as an unrealized loss in common stockholders equity 
if the decline is believed to be other than temporary  it is written down to the carrying value of the investment and a realized loss is recorded on aihl s statement of earnings 
management s assessment of a decline in value includes  among other things  its current judgment as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity that issued the investment security 
if that judgment changes in the future  aihl may ultimately record a realized loss after having originally concluded that the decline in value was temporary

borrowings under the credit agreement will be available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
our practice is to repay borrowings under our credit agreements promptly in order to keep the facilities available for future acquisitions 
we did not borrow any amounts under the credit agreement during the year ended december

in  alleghany made capital contributions of approximately million to aihl to acquire and capitalize resurgens specialty  ric and landmark as discussed below and to allow cata to strengthen reserves

in and  we did not purchase any shares of our common stock 
in  we purchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for approximately million  at an average cost of per share 
dividends from subsidiaries 
at december   about million of the equity of our subsidiaries was available for dividends or advances to us 
at that date  approximately billion of our total equity of approximately billion was unavailable for dividends or advances to us from our subsidiaries  due to limitations imposed by statutes and agreements with lenders to which those subsidiaries are subject 
in particular  our insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid by them without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities 
a maximum of million was available for dividends without prior approval of the applicable insurance regulatory authorities at year end 
these limitations have not affected our ability to meet our obligations 
in  rsui paid us a cash dividend of million 
contractual obligations 
we have certain obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related financial commitments were as follows in thousands more than more than more within year but within years but than contractual obligations total year years within years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities reflected on consolidated balance sheet under gaap losses and lae total other long term liabilities primarily reflect pension and long term incentive obligations 

table of contents our insurance operating units have obligations to make certain payments for losses and lae pursuant to insurance policies they issue 
these future payments are reflected as reserves on our financial statements 
with respect to loss and lae  there is typically no minimum contractual commitment associated with insurance contracts and the timing and ultimate amount of actual claims related to these reserves is uncertain 
additional information regarding reserves for loss and lae  including information regarding the timing of payments of these expenses  can be found on pages through  page  pages through and pages through of this form k report 
material off balance sheet arrangements 
we did not enter into any off balance sheet arrangements during  or  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at december   or subsidiaries financial strength is also a high priority of our subsidiaries  whose assets stand behind their financial commitments to their customers and vendors 
we believe that we and our subsidiaries have and will have adequate internally generated funds  cash resources and unused credit facilities to provide for the currently foreseeable needs of our and their businesses 
we and our subsidiaries have no material commitments for capital expenditures 
aihl 
the obligations and cash outflow of aihl s insurance operating units include claim settlements  administrative expenses and purchases of investments 
in addition to premium collections  cash inflow is obtained from interest and dividend income and maturities and sales of investments 
because cash inflow from premiums is received in advance of cash outflow required to settle claims  aihl s insurance operating units accumulate funds which they invest pending the need for liquidity 
as an insurance company s cash needs can be unpredictable due to the uncertainty of the claims settlement process  aihl s portfolio which includes those of its insurance operating units is composed primarily of debt securities and short term investments to ensure the availability of funds and maintain a sufficient amount of liquid securities 
as of december   investments and cash represented percent of the assets of aihl and its insurance operating units 
at december   we had total unpaid losses and lae of approximately billion and reinsurance recoverables on these total unpaid losses and lae of approximately billion 
as of december   aihl s investment portfolio had a fair market value of billion and consisted primarily of high quality debt securities with an average life of years and an effective duration of years 
effective duration measures a portfolio s sensitivity to change in interest rates  a change within a range of plus or minus percent in interest rates would be expected to result in an inverse change of approximately percent in the fair market value of the portfolio of aihl 
the overall debt securities portfolio credit quality is measured using the lower of either standard poors or moody s rating 
the weighted average rating at december  was aaa  with over percent of all securities rated investment grade 
aihl s investment portfolio contains no investments of a derivative nature

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the primary market risk related to our non trading financial instruments is the risk of loss associated with adverse changes in interest rates 
we invest in equity securities which are subject to fluctuations in market value 
we also purchase debt securities with fixed maturities that exposes us to risk related to adverse changes in interest rates 
we hold our equity securities and debt securities as available for sale 
any changes in the fair value in these securities  net of tax  would be reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders equity 
the table below summarizes our equity price risk and shows the effect of a hypothetical increase or decrease in market prices as of december  and on the estimated fair value of our consolidated equity portfolio 
the selected hypothetical changes do not indicate what could be the potential best or worst case scenarios dollars in millions estimated fair value hypothetical percentage as of estimated fair hypothetical after hypothetical increase decrease in december  value price change change in prices stockholders equity increase decrease increase decrease the primary market risk for our and our subsidiaries long term debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing 
we monitor the interest rate environment to evaluate refinancing opportunities 
other than one interest rate swap  we currently do not use derivatives to manage market and interest rate risks 
in respect of the interest rate swap  we are exposed to a credit risk in the unlikely event of nonperformance by the swap counterparty 
the tables below present a sensitivity analysis of our consolidated debt securities and subsidiaries debt  as of december  and  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential change in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates over a selected time 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure its potential change  and a basis point range of change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of the financial instruments included in the analysis 
the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical december  and ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a basis point range of change in interest rates  comparing these hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices  and multiplying the difference by the par outstanding

the actual impact of changes in equity prices and market interest rates on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the above sensitivity analyses 
the sensitivity analyses are further limited because they do not consider any actions we could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in equity prices and in interest rates 
as a result of our sale of world minerals in july  we do not have any foreign currency risk as we no longer have any foreign operations
