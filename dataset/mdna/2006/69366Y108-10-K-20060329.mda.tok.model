you should review the risk factors under item a  and the future outlook comments below  for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
executive summary we had a very successful year in on multiple fronts 
throughout and  our operating performance has continued to improve 
both our volumes and margins increased in both years compared to the previous year  and our resulting cash flow from operations in was significantly higher than the prior year 
in addition to our pvc business continuing to grow  in september  uspoly acquired the uponor aldyl business  making our pe business a much bigger and more competitive business 
during the third quarter of  we announced our plan to sell uspoly s interest in wl plastics corporation 
this transaction closed during the fourth quarter of and  during the fourth quarter of  we also completed the private placement of  shares of our common stock 
this combined improvement in cash from operations  and the proceeds from the sale of wl plastics and the sale of common stock  allowed us to pay all of our outstanding senior term debt and subordinated debt in the fourth quarter  as well as significantly reduce the amount of our outstanding revolving debt 
as a result  our financial position at december  is very strong  and our debt obligations and interest expense going forward will be much lower than recent years 
we believe the main drivers of industry performance are us gross domestic product gdp growth and supply and demand of pvc resin 
historically  our profitability has improved during periods of strong gdp growth and decreased during periods of slower growth or recession 
gdp growth improved in the first nine months of compared to and  demand for pvc resin for use in pipe was strong  and our margins increased 
and although gdp slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter of  the effect of hurricanes katrina and rita contributed to a continuing increase in demand and selling prices 
as the pvc resin industry has recovered from the hurricane related disruptions during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  supply and demand of pvc pipe have moved to a more balanced situation 
during the first quarter of our margins have decreased from the record high levels of the fourth quarter of but remain above historical levels 
if pvc resin and pipe supplies remain at levels to adequately service demand  our margins could contract further during the balance of we monitor several non financial indicators in evaluating our business operations and future prospects  including price of pvc and pe resin gdp interest rates demand for pvc and pe pipe products  and dollars per pound of pipe sold 
we provide a more detailed discussion of pvc and pe resin prices  gdp  interest rates and demand for pvc and pe pipe products under the future outlook section of this discussion below  and under item a 
risk factors 
we will comment in more detail on our consolidated results of operations  results of operations by segment  and liquidity and capital resources in each of those respective sections below

net sales net sales increased by million in compared to of this increase  million was due to higher volume and pricing in our pvc products  million was due to the uac acquisition in our pe business in late  and the balance of was due to volume and pricing in our other pe products 
the pvc increase was due in large part to pricing increases 
the average selling prices were above averages for all of the year  but were particularly higher during the fourth quarter of this increase in prices resulted from the pvc resin manufacturing and supply disruptions  caused by hurricanes katrina and rita which led to a situation where demand for pvc pipe exceeded supply 
during early  both demand for and prices of pvc pipe have decreased from the levels seen at the end of net sales increased by million in compared to of this increase  million was due to higher volume and pricing in our pvc products  million was due to the uac acquisition in our pe business in late  and the balance of was due to volume and pricing in our other pe products 
gross profit the gross profit increases as a percentage of sales  from to and to  are primarily due to the increasing spread of selling prices over the cost of raw materials in our pvc business 
in fiscal year  we experienced poor demand and declining prices 
our pricing spread has been steadily improving since then  particularly during the fourth quarter of  which has increased our gross profits 
operating expenses operating expenses increased by million in compared to freight and selling costs increased by million due to the overall volume increases and higher selling prices  and higher costs for freight both in rates per pound and special handling charges when the industry experienced shortages of available trucks 
general and administrative costs increased by million  including a million increase in our pe products business  due largely to the uac acquisition 
the remaining increase in administrative costs was due to several items including higher overall compensation costs based on the improvement in profitability and higher professional service fees  among others 
these increases were partially offset by a million gain on the sale of land and the absence of any restructuring costs in  and also because included a loss on the sale of facilities of million 
in addition  our pe business realized a gain on the sale of its metals parts business of million in the second quarter of comparing to  operating expenses increased by million 
freight and selling costs accounted for million of this increase  due to higher sales volumes and selling prices  and higher freight rates on a per pound basis 
other expenses increased by million net  with the reduction in general and administrative expenses as a result of the restructuring activities begun in and ongoing cost control measures 
gain on sale of investee on november   uspoly sold its approximately interest in wl plastics 
uspoly received million cash and an additional million will be held in escrow for a period of months and is subject to customary post closing contingencies 
the purchase price is subject to a working capital adjustment which is expected to be resolved in a substantial portion of the cash was used to pay down debt obligations of uspoly and pw eagle 
a gain of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of related to this transaction 
interest expense interest expense increased million in compared to included in were million of prepayment penalties associated with our payment of all subordinated debt and term loans  and non cash charges of million for the related write off of unamortized debt discounts and deferred finance costs 
in addition  there was an additional million of non cash charges for the fair value adjustments for warrants issued in connection with the subordinated debt 
interest expense increased by million in from due to higher interest rates and higher debt levels 
at the time of our refinancing in october  we incurred million in interest charges from prepayment penalties  debt discount amortization and write off of related deferred finance costs 
interest expense also includes a million non cash charge to adjust to fair value the warrants issued with the subordinated debt 
see note financing arrangements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item for further discussion of related debt transactions 
income taxes the income tax expense benefit for the years ended december   and was calculated based on management s estimates of the annual effective tax rate for each year 
the annual differences in and from our usual tax rate of approximately are primarily due to permanent differences from charges related to the stock warrants 
results of operations by segment in thousand  except for per share amounts percent change years ended december  vs vs net sales pvc products pe products consolidated net sales operating income loss pvc products of sales pe products of sales consolidated operating income loss of sales gain on sale of investee interest expense income loss before income taxes  minority interest and equity in undistributed earnings of unconsolidated affiliate pvc segment pvc sales increased million in over  due to an overall volume increase of  accounting for million of the sales increase  and average pricing increases accounting for million 
most of our plants have been operating at near capacity levels for much of the average selling prices were above averages for all of the year  but were particularly higher during the fourth quarter of this recent increase in prices resulted from the pvc resin manufacturing and supply disruptions  caused by the hurricanes katrina and rita  which led to a situation where demand for pvc pipe exceeded supply 
during early  both demand for and prices of pvc pipe have decreased from the levels seen at the end of the spread of selling prices over the cost of raw materials has increased throughout  particularly in the fourth quarter  resulting in better gross margins 
operating expenses increased by million in compared to freight and selling costs increased by million due to the higher sales and higher freight rates during the year  and general and administrative expenses increased million 
general and administrative costs increased due to several items including higher overall compensation costs based on the improvement in profitability  and higher professional service fees  among others 
these increases were partially offset by a million gain on the sale of land and the absence of any restructuring costs in  and also because included a loss on the sale of facilities of million 
the result was an increase in operating income of million from to the pvc sales increase of million in over resulted from an overall volume increase of  accounting for million of the sales increase  and pricing increases accounting for million 
also contributing to the sales increase was the eti acquisition in march gross margins improved in compared to due to increasing spreads of selling prices over the cost of raw materials as demand improved from when prices were declining and demand was weaker than normal  especially in the second and third quarters 
in addition  included a full year of the ultra products from the eti acquisition  which have higher margins 
operating expenses increased million in compared to freight and selling costs increased due to the higher sales volumes  increasing freight rates during the year  and the higher freight costs associated with the ultra products 
general and administrative costs declined due to the restructuring activities begun in and ongoing cost control measures  and there was a loss on sale of facilities of million 
the net result was an increase in operating income of million from to pe segment pe sales increased million from to sales from the uac acquisition late in the third quarter of contributed million of the increase  along with increases in the other pe products of million 
overall volume of pounds sold increased  and average selling prices increased over 
gross margins improved due to the volume increase overall  while the gross margins as a percentage of net sales stayed about the same 
operating expenses increased by million in compared to this is primarily due to inclusion for the year of the costs associated with business acquired from uac  as well as higher freight and commission costs for the higher sales volume 
these cost increases were partially offset by the gain on the sale of the metals parts business of million in the second quarter of the result was an increase in operating income of million from to pe sales increased million from to sales from the uac acquisition contributed million of the increase  with increases in the other products of million 
gross margin improved due to the higher sales  and operating expenses were higher as well  due to the uac costs  with a resulting decrease in operating income of million from to liquidity and capital resources total assets of million at december  represented a million increase from the million at december  this increase was from current assets  with the net increase in accounts receivable and inventories amounting to million  offset by decreases in property and equipment of million and decreases in deferred income taxes of million 
goodwill increased million as a result of our purchase of the minority interest in uspoly in the fourth quarter 
total capitalization at december  was million  consisting of million of debt and million of equity  with debt decreasing by million and equity increasing by million from december  amounts 
the increase in current assets is due to higher selling prices and a higher cost of resin in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of  which resulted in higher accounts receivable and inventory amounts 
the decrease in property and equipment is primarily due to depreciation in excess of capital expenditures  along with a small land sale  and the uspoly sale of its metals line of business as discussed in note in the consolidated financial statements under item as of december  the decrease in deferred tax assets is a result of the income tax provisions for the current year  with net operating loss carryovers expected to be fully utilized when the final tax returns are filed 
we had working capital of million at december   which is an increase of million from the negative working capital of million at december  this improvement is the result of our return to profitability in  and the resulting positive cash flow from operations of million for the year ended december  in addition to the improvement in working capital  we had additional availability on our revolving credit facilities of over million at december  the million positive cash flow from operations  as well as the proceeds of approximately million from the sale of common stock as described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item  and the million in proceeds from the sale of the investment in wl plastics see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item  allowed us to not only pay off all outstanding senior term debt and subordinated debt during the fourth quarter  but also reduce the revolving debt by million to only million outstanding at december   as compared to million outstanding at december  this overall debt reduction  which has significantly strengthened our balance sheet  will also reduce our interest expense going forward 
capital spending for property and equipment was million in  primarily for equipment maintenance and upgrades  and a new ultra product manufacturing line 
the capital spending plan for is expected to be in the range of to million for continued expansion of the ultra product line in the western region of the united states  improvements in facilties and capacity increases 
management believes that  for the foreseeable future  the company can fund requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and other obligations with cash generated from operations and borrowing from existing credit facilities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million of cash used in operating activities in this net change of million is primarily a result of a net change in net income of million  and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
investing activities provided million in compared to million used in in addition to capital expenditures  included the purchase of the minority interest in uspoly of million  offset by proceeds from sale of the metals business of million and proceeds from the sale of wl plastics of million 
the uac acquisition in used million in cash  and capital expenditures for were million 
in  we also sold our hastings and baker city facilities for million in a sale leaseback transaction  acquired an additional interest in wl plastics for million  and received proceeds from the sale of miscellaneous equipment of million 
financing activities used million in this includes a net reduction of our revolving credit facilities and repayment of long term senior and subordinated debt  amounting to million 
financing activities also included proceeds from a sale of stock of million 
financing activities provided million during the primary sources of cash were net borrowings under the senior credit facilities of pw eagle and uspoly 
debt issuance and financing costs of million were incurred primarily in connection with the pw eagle refinancing and uac acquisition financing 
credit facilities a summary of amounts outstanding under each of our credit facilities at december  and december  follows in thousands december  december  borrowings under revolving credit facilities pw eagle uspoly total amounts outstanding under revolving credit facilities long term debt  net of discounts pw eagle subordinated notes pw eagle capital lease obligation uspoly seller note uspoly senior term notes uspoly senior subordinated note uspoly capital lease obligations total amounts outstanding under long term credit facilities total amounts outstanding pw eagle and uspoly each had separate financing arrangements with each entity responsible for its own obligations without any guarantees or cross defaults 
during the fourth quarter of  all of uspoly s financing arrangements  other than capital lease obligations  were paid and all of pw eagle s subordinated notes were paid 
further information on the company s financing arrangements can be found in note financing arrangements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item the company s obligations at december  under its financing arrangements are summarized in the table below scheduled contractual obligations total after years capital lease obligations operating leases estimated interest on revolving credit facilities the estimated interest on revolving credit facilities is based on the current outstanding debt amount of million at december  the interest rate assumed is the current asset collateral revolving debt rate paid by pw eagle of 
the estimated annual interest amount is included through the termination dates of the revolving credit facility  which is october  for pw eagle 
we had commitments for capital expenditures of million at december   which we intend to fund from our revolving credit facilities  or cash flow from operations 
at december   the company had a contingent liability for standby letters of credit totaling million that are issued and outstanding 
these letters of credit guarantee payment to third parties in the event the company is unable to pay in a timely manner 
standby letters of credit reduce the funds available under the revolving credit facilities 
no amounts were drawn on these letters of credit as of december  under current financing agreements  pw eagle is required to comply with certain restrictive financial ratios and covenants 
the most restrictive covenant for pw eagle requires us to maintain a minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  including adjustments as defined in the debt agreement  of million on a rolling month period ending each calendar quarter 
some of the capital lease obligations also contain covenants that either mirror  or are less restrictive than  the senior debt covenants 
at december   pw eagle was in compliance with all debt covenants and uspoly had no applicable debt covenants remaining 
restructuring activities in response to difficult economic conditions and poor operating results  the company decided to consolidate the pwpipe and eti business units under common management control in october the former eti headquarters office in denver  colorado was closed and all administrative and accounting functions were transferred to the eugene  oregon office 
in addition  effective january  the corporate office in minneapolis  minnesota was closed and all corporate office functions were transferred to the eugene  oregon office 
as a result of the consolidation  approximately positions were eliminated 
in addition  certain officers and directors resigned their positions and cancelled consulting agreements 
in connection with the officer resignations  the board of directors modified certain outstanding restricted stock and stock option awards effective january  the modifications allow for continued vesting of the stock awards  which would have been forfeited upon the officers resignation under the original terms  resulting in a charge of million 
during  the board of directors approved the payment of management bonuses of million for the successful restructuring of the company 
the recipients of the management bonus elected to receive million in pw eagle common stock and million in cash 
in connection with these activities  we incurred restructuring charges of million in and million in at december   we had million of severance payments remaining from the restructuring  which were paid in future outlook and risks to our business the statements contained in this section and statements contained in items  a   and a of this report on form k and the president s letter to shareholders in connection with our annual meeting of shareholders regarding our beliefs and expectations that are not strictly historical are forward looking statements made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements reflect our current expectations and beliefs as of march  and are based on information known to us  and our assumptions as of that date 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown business risks and risks that we cannot control 
as a result  statements regarding our expectations may prove to be inaccurate and our operating results may differ materially from our stated expectations and beliefs 
some of our current beliefs and expectations are discussed below 
forward looking statements pvc and pe resin manufacturers were significantly impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita during the third quarter of manufacturing plants in both louisiana and texas ceased operating during the storms and curtailed production thereafter due to lack of utilities and or raw material supply 
the subsequent difficulties with the rail service made the situation worse 
also  one manufacturer experienced production disruptions as a result of an accident and fire at one of its facilities 
all major suppliers declared force majeure and for a period of time supplied customers on some form of allocation 
these interruptions in supply resulted in significant price increases in both pe and pvc resin 
in light of the potential supply disruptions  pvc and pe pipe buyers accelerated their purchasing patterns  resulting in a very strong demand surge in september and continuing into the fourth quarter 
faced with this strong demand  limited raw material supply and rising costs  we and many other pipe manufacturers implemented multiple price increases 
because we were able to increase prices at a rate ahead of increasing resin costs  we improved gross margins as well  resulting in strong sales volumes and high gross margins in the fourth quarter of most of the disruption in supply of pvc and pe resin caused by hurricanes katrina and rita was resolved by the end of  resulting in increased availability of  and decreasing prices for  resin 
in december  pvc resin prices decreased per pound  remained flat in january and decreased in february prices for pvc pipe have moderated somewhat in the first part of as resin prices have decreased 
if resin supplies remain at levels to adequately service demand  resin prices could decrease further during the balance of during periods of decreasing resin prices  pipe selling prices have tended to decrease faster than raw material cost  resulting in lower margins 
this pattern may repeat itself if resin prices continue to decrease  resulting in lower margins in as compared to the fourth quarter of we also expect sales volumes in the first quarter of to decline from the level in the fourth quarter of as pvc and pe pipe buyers gain increased confidence in the availability of adequate supplies 
the short term expectations described above may be mitigated to some extent by the following broader trends in our business 
we expect the demand for plastic pipe to grow as acceptance of plastic pipe over metal pipe continues and the overall economy continues to grow 
we believe that the gross domestic product gdp is closely correlated to the demand for pvc and pe pipe  and we recognize that our business is tied to economic cycles 
gdp is estimated to have grown at an annual rate of in and in industry growth projections call for annual sales growth rates for pvc pipe of or greater in the actual growth rate may be less or greater than based on short term economic conditions 
our strategy has been  and continues to be  to concentrate growth initiatives in higher profit products and geographic regions 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recorded values of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies and areas that require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements include allowance for doubtful accounts and sales discounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts necessary to maintain the allowance at a level estimated to be sufficient to absorb future losses due to accounts that are potentially uncollectible 
the allowance is based on our historical experience  prior years write offs  aging of past due accounts  financial condition of the customer and the general economic conditions of our market place 
actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
we wrote off million of uncollectible accounts during  million during  and million during  while our charges to bad debt expenses amounted to million in and million in  and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  had our actual write offs been significantly higher  or had the aging deteriorated  we may have required a larger allowance at december  we also maintain an allowance for sales discounts 
this allowance is based on our historical experience of discounts given  and current terms of sale 
the total discounts are deducted from gross sales 
the dollar amount of such discounts is directly related to total gross sales  and the related terms of sale of such transactions 
the allowance amount for sales discounts was million at december  and million at december  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method and includes materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
judgment by management is required to determine both replacement cost and market 
we recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment in the fourth quarter of  reducing pipe inventory values by million 
no such adjustment was required at either december  or a change in this management estimate would impact cost of goods sold and the inventory carrying value 
long lived assets management periodically reviews its long lived and intangible assets and goodwill for impairment and assesses whether significant events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the anticipated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of that asset and its eventual disposition 
the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded  if any  is calculated by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
management also periodically reassesses the estimated remaining useful lives of its long lived assets 
changes to either estimated future undiscounted cash flows or useful lives would impact the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in earnings 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment by management is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense within the tax provision is included in the consolidated statement of operations 
the deferred tax assets at december  are primarily the result of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes 
these net operating losses  which expire at various dates through  amounted to approximately million and million for federal and state tax purposes  respectively  at december  based upon the income before taxes of million  the company expects to utilize substantially all remaining net operating losses when filing its final tax returns 
insurance liability we self insure a significant portion of our employees for health and dental related claims and record a claims liability based on claims history 
the liability is based on analysis of our historical claim activity and reporting trends 
while management believes that the insurance liability is adequate at year end  results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results
