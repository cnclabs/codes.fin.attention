item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
executive summary we generate revenues from our homebuilding operations homebuilding and financial services operations financial services  which comprise our operating segments 
through our homebuilding operations we design  build and market high quality detached single family residences  town homes and condominiums in various metropolitan markets in ten states located in four major geographic regions florida  the mid atlantic  texas and the west 
florida mid atlantic texas west jacksonville baltimore southern pennsylvania austin colorado orlando delaware dallas ft 
worth las vegas southeast florida nashville houston phoenix southwest florida northern virginia san antonio tampa st 
petersburg we conduct our homebuilding operations through our consolidated subsidiaries and through various joint ventures that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations and or joint ventures that additionally build and market homes 
none of these joint ventures is consolidated 
at december   our investment in these unconsolidated joint ventures was million 
additionally  we had receivables of million from these joint ventures 
we also seek to use option contracts to acquire land whenever feasible 
option contracts allow us to control significant homesite positions with minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with landownership and development 
at december   we controlled approximately  home sites of which were controlled through various option arrangements 
additionally  our joint ventures controlled approximately  homesites at december  for the year ended december   total consolidated revenues increased  consolidated net income increased  combined net sales orders increased and combined home deliveries increased as compared to the prior year 
consolidated sales value in backlog at december  as compared to december  increased by to billion 
our joint ventures had an additional billion in sales backlog at december  our combined home cancellation rate was approximately for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  homebuilding operations 
we build homes for inventory speculative homes and on a pre sold basis 
at december   we had  homes completed or under construction on a combined basis compared to  homes at december  approximately of these homes were unsold at december  compared to at december  at december   we had completed unsold homes in our inventory on a combined basis  down from homes at december  approximately of our completed  unsold homes at december  had been completed for more than days 
we actively work to control our finished speculative home inventory to reduce carrying costs  increase our available capital and improve our gross margins 
once a sales contract with a buyer has been approved  we classify the transaction as a new sales order and include the home in backlog 
such sales orders are usually subject to certain contingencies such as the buyer s ability to qualify for financing 
at closing  title passes to the buyer and a home is considered to be delivered and is removed from backlog 
revenue and cost of sales are recognized upon the delivery of the home  land or homesite when title is transferred to the buyer 
we estimate that the average period between the execution of a sales contract for a home and closing is approximately four months to over a year for presold homes  however  this varies by market 
the principal expenses of our homebuilding operations are i cost of sales and ii selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
costs of home sales include land and land development costs  home construction costs  previously capitalized indirect costs  capitalized interest and estimated warranty costs 
sg a expenses for our homebuilding operations include administrative costs  advertising expenses  on site marketing expenses  sales commission costs  and closing costs 
sales commissions are included in selling  general and administrative costs when the related revenue is recognized 
as used herein  homebuilding includes results of home and land sales 
home sales includes results related only to the sale of homes 
our homebuilding operations continue to be impacted by labor and supply shortages and increases in the cost of materials caused by the recent active hurricane seasons and the high costs of petroleum 
we have been notified by several vendors and subcontractors to expect increases in the costs of materials and labor 
we are proactively responding to these situations by actively working to reduce the amount of time from sale to delivery  increasing cost contingencies in our home budgets  and increasing home sales prices as quickly as the competitive market will allow 
in general  we anticipate a more challenging housing market in  characterized by softening demand  decreased ability to raise home prices  lengthening regulatory processes and higher material costs 
financial services operations 
to provide homebuyers with a seamless home purchasing experience  we have a complementary financial services business which provides mortgage financing and closing services and offers title  homeowners and other insurance products to our homebuyers and others 
our mortgage financing operation derives most of its revenues from buyers of our homes  although it also offers its services to existing homeowners refinancing their mortgages 
our title and closing services and our insurance agency operations are used by our homebuyers and a broad range of other clients purchasing or refinancing residential or commercial real estate 
our mortgage financing operations revenues consist primarily of origination and premium fee income  interest income  and the gain on the sale of the mortgages 
our title operations revenues consist primarily of fees and premiums from title insurance and closing services 
the principal expenses of our financial services operations are sg a expenses  which consist primarily of compensation and interest expense on our warehouse lines of credit 
critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we apply accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the application of generally accepted accounting principles may require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying results 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical or require the use of complex judgment in their application 
homebuilding revenues and cost of sales revenue from the sale of homes and the sale of land and homesites is recognized at closing when title passes to the buyer and all of the following conditions are met a sale is consummated  a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is complete  and the collection of any remaining receivables is reasonably assured 
as a result  our revenue recognition process does not involve significant judgments or estimates 
however  we do rely on certain estimates to determine the related construction and land costs and resulting gross profit associated with revenues recognized 
our construction and land costs are comprised of direct and allocated costs  including interest  indirect construction costs and estimated costs for future warranties and indemnities 
our estimates are based on historical results  adjusted for current factors 
land  land improvements and other common costs are generally allocated on a relative fair value basis to units within a parcel or community 
land and land development costs generally include related interest and property taxes incurred until construction is substantially completed 
financial services revenues and expenses our financial services operations generate revenues from their mortgage financing and title operations 
our mortgage financing operations revenues consist primarily of origination and premium fee income  interest income and the gain on the sale of the mortgages 
revenue from our mortgage financing operations is recognized when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
substantially all of our mortgages are sold to private investors within days of closing 
title operations revenues consist primarily of title insurance agency and closing services  which are recognized as homes are delivered 
as a result  our revenue recognition process does not involve significant judgments or estimates 
impairment of long lived assets housing communities and land homesites under development are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we assess these assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors involving some amount of uncertainty 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill goodwill is accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill is not subject to amortization 
goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
for purposes of the impairment test  we consider each division a reporting unit 
our impairment test is based on discounted cash flows derived from internal projections 
this process requires us to make assumptions on future revenues  costs  and timing of expected cash flows 
due to the degree of judgment required and uncertainties surrounding such estimates  actual results could differ from such estimates 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
for these reasons  we consider the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment to be a critical accounting estimate 
we performed our annual impairment test as of december  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
homesite option contracts and consolidation of variable interest entities in the ordinary course of business we enter into option contracts to purchase homesites and land held for development 
option contracts allow us to control significant homesite positions with minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
our liability for nonperformance under such contracts is generally limited to forfeiture of the related deposits 
at december   we owned approximately  homesites and had option contracts on  homesites  and our unconsolidated joint ventures controlled  homesites 
at december  and december   we had refundable and nonrefundable deposits aggregating million and million  respectively  included in inventory 
in addition  at december  and december   we had issued million and million  respectively  in letters of credit under option contracts 
we enter into option contracts with land sellers and third party financial entities as a method of acquiring developed homesites 
from time to time to leverage our ability to acquire and finance the development of these homesites  we transfer our option right to third parties 
option contracts generally require the payment of a non refundable cash deposit or the issuance of a letter of credit for the right to acquire homesites over a specified period of time at predetermined prices 
typically  our deposits or letters of credit are less than of the underlying purchase price 
we generally have the right at our discretion to terminate our obligations under these option agreements by forfeiting our cash deposit or repaying amounts drawn under the letter of credit with no further financial responsibility 
we do not have legal title to these assets 
additionally  we do not have an investment in the third party acquiror and do not guarantee their liabilities 
however  if certain conditions are met  including the deposit and or letters of credit exceeding certain significance levels as compared to the remaining homesites under the option contract  we will include the homesites in inventory with a corresponding liability in obligations for inventory not owned 
homebuilders may enter into option contracts for the purchase of land or homesites with land sellers and third party financial entities  some of which qualify as variable interest entities vies under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
fin r addresses consolidation by business enterprises of vies in which an entity absorbs a majority of the expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity  which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  or the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  or b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses 
in applying fin r to our homesite option contracts and other transactions with vies  we make estimates regarding cash flows and other assumptions 
we believe that our critical assumptions underlying these estimates are reasonable based on historical evidence and industry practice 
based on our analysis of transactions entered into with vies  we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these homesite option contracts 
consequently  fin r requires us to consolidate the assets homesites at their fair value  although we have no legal title to the assets  our maximum exposure to loss is generally limited to the deposits or letters of credits placed with these entities  and creditors  if any  of these entities have no recourse against us 
we classify these assets as inventory not owned with a corresponding liability in obligations for inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition 
additionally  we have entered into arrangements with vies to acquire homesites in which our variable interest is insignificant and  therefore  we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary and are not required to consolidate the assets of such vies 
warranty reserves in the normal course of business we will incur warranty related costs associated with homes that have been delivered to the homebuyers 
warranty reserves are established by charging cost of sales and recognizing a liability for the estimated warranty costs for each home that is delivered 
we monitor this reserve on a regular basis by evaluating the historical warranty experience in each market in which we operate and the reserve is adjusted as appropriate for current quantitative and qualitative factors 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
insurance and litigation reserves insurance and litigation reserves have been established for estimated amounts based on an analysis of past history of claims 
we have  and require the majority of our subcontractors to have  general liability insurance that protects us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction related claims 
we reserve for costs to cover our self insured retentions and deductible amounts under these policies and for any costs in excess of our coverage limits 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated reserve amounts  actual future claim costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
recent acquisitions on august   through a joint venture the transeastern jv  we completed the acquisition of the homebuilding assets and operations of transeastern properties  inc transeastern headquartered in coral springs  florida 
our joint venture partner is an entity controlled by the former majority owners of transeastern 
the transeastern jv acquired transeastern s homebuilding assets  including work in process  finished lots and certain land option rights  for approximately million which includes the assumption of million of liabilities  net of million of cash 
additional consideration of up to million will be paid to the sellers pursuant to an earn out agreement if certain conditions are met  such as achieving predetermined quarterly ebitda targets and delivery of entitlement on certain tracts of land currently held under lot option contracts 
in addition to the net assets acquired in the transaction  the transeastern jv will have a right of first offer on land developed by a related entity of our joint venture partner for a period of five years 
we are the managing member of the transeastern jv and hold a voting interest 
under the limited liability company agreement that governs the operations of the transeastern jv the jv agreement  the transeastern jv is required to make a preferred payment to our joint venture partner 
the preferred payment is to be made quarterly and to the extent allowable under certain covenants and restrictions imposed by the joint venture s bank borrowings 
to the extent the joint venture is not allowed to make these payments we are required  under the jv agreement  to advance funds to the transeastern jv in the form of a member loan in an amount sufficient to make the payment 
the member loan bears interest at per annum and is payable once certain conditions and covenants under the jv agreement and the joint venture s bank borrowings are met 
the transeastern jv was funded with million of third party debt capacity of which million was drawn upon acquisition  a million subordinated bridge loan from us and million of equity  of which million was contributed by us 
the third party debt is secured by the transeastern jv s assets and ownership interests and is non recourse to us  except that we have agreed to complete any property development commitments on the existing work in process at the time of closing in the event the transeastern jv defaults and to indemnify the lenders for losses resulting from fraud  misappropriation and similar acts

income before provision for income taxes increased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase is attributable to an increase in homebuilding pretax income to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this change primarily is due to the impact of the american jobs creation act of  which was partially offset by an increase in state income taxes resulting from increased income in states with higher tax rates 
as a result of the above  net income increased to million or per diluted share for the year ended december  from million or per diluted share for the year ended december  results of operations homebuilding homebuilding revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december  this increase is due to an increase in revenues from home sales to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the comparable period in and an increase in revenues from land sales to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue from home sales was due to an increase in consolidated home deliveries to  from  for the year ended december  and  respectively  and a increase in the average selling price on consolidated homes delivered to  from  in the comparable period of the prior year 
a significant component of this increase was the increase in revenues from home sales in our florida region for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in this increase was due to an increase in consolidated homes delivered in florida and an increase in the average selling price of such homes 
the increase in revenues from land sales is due to the sale of various large tracts of land  particularly in the phoenix market  in an attempt to diversify our risk and recognize embedded profits 
as part of our land inventory management strategy  we regularly review our land portfolio 
as a result of these reviews  we will seek to sell land when we have changed our strategy for a certain property and or we have determined that the potential profit realizable from a sale of a property outweighs the economics of developing a community 
land sales are incidental to our residential homebuilding operations and are expected to continue in the future  but may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
our homebuilding gross margin increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to improved gross margin on home sales and an increase in revenue from home sales as well as an increase in gross margin from land sales 
our gross margin on home sales increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this increase from period to period is primarily due to reducing the time period from signing a contract to closing  the phasing of sales to maximize revenues and improve margins  our ability to increase prices in markets with strong housing demand  improved control over costs  such as the re engineering of existing products to reduce costs of construction and achieve cost synergies from our vendor relationships  and the reduction of carrying costs on inventory through improved control over the number of unsold homes completed or under construction  particularly in our texas and west regions 
for the year ended december   we generated gross margin from land sales of million  as compared to million for the comparable period in sg a expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses is due to increased compensation resulting from increased headcount and significantly increased incentive compensation tied to increased earnings  including increased gross profit from land sales and income from unconsolidated joint ventures 
this increase in sg a was partially offset by a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized a compensation charge of million and million  respectively  due to the variable accounting treatment of certain stock based awards which include performance based accelerated vesting criteria and certain other common stock purchase rights 
the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized by us with respect to these stock based awards and common stock purchase rights  if any  is uncertain and depends on the price of our common stock  which fluctuates based upon various factors  many of which are outside of our control 
the accelerated vesting of our performance based stock options depends on the extent to which our stock price performance exceeds the stock price performance of certain of our peers 
sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to for the year ended december  the basis point increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues is due to the increased compensation discussed above 
our ratio of sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales is also affected by the fact that our consolidated revenues from home sales do not include revenues recognized by our unconsolidated joint ventures  however  the compensation and other expenses incurred by us in connection with certain of these joint ventures are included in our consolidated sg a expenses 
for the year ended december   the income associated with these joint ventures was million  including management fees of million  and is shown separately as income from joint ventures in our consolidated statement of income 
other income consists primarily of interest income earned on the investment of cash 
our net profit margin is calculated by dividing net income by home sales revenues 
for the year ended december   our net profit margin increased to from due to improved gross margins on home sales  increased gross margin from land sales  and increased income from unconsolidated joint ventures 
net sales orders and homes in backlog combined for the year ended december   net sales orders increased by as compared to the same period in approximately half of this increase was attributable to the transeastern joint venture 
our net sales orders in florida for were negatively impacted by the adverse weather conditions and preparation and recovery efforts related to the hurricane season 
additionally  our net sales orders were adversely impacted by our intentional efforts to slow sales rates to match our production rates  particularly in our transeastern joint venture 
on a broader basis  land development and permitting issues prevented us from opening certain communities within previously anticipated time frames 
we expect these factors to continue to negatively impact our combined net sales orders in the near term 
we had  homes in backlog as of december   as compared to  homes in backlog as of december  the acquisition of transeastern s homebuilding assets and operations during included a significant amount of backlog  homes 
additionally  during  we transferred homes in backlog and homes under construction  from our consolidated operations in the west region to an unconsolidated joint venture 
backlog sales value consolidated the sales value of backlog increased to billion at december   from billion at december   while the average selling price of homes in backlog increased to  from  from period to period 
the increase in the average selling price of homes in backlog was primarily due to our ability to increase prices in markets with strong housing demand as well as our continued efforts to phase sales to maximize gross margins 
joint venture backlog sales value joint venture revenues are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   the sales value of our joint ventures homes in backlog was billion compared to million at december  financial services financial services revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to an increase in the number of closings at our title and mortgage operations offset by reduced gains in selling mortgages in the secondary market caused by a shift toward more adjustable rate mortgage loans and market reductions in the interest rate margin 
for the year ended december   our mix of mortgage originations was adjustable rate mortgages of which approximately were interest only and fixed rate mortgages  which is a shift from the comparable period in the prior year of adjustable rate mortgages and fixed rate mortgages 
the average fico score of our homebuyers during the year ended december  was  and the average loan to value ratio on first mortgages was 
for the year ended december   approximately of our homebuyers paid in cash as compared to during the year ended december  our combined mortgage operations capture ratio for non cash homebuyers increased to excluding the transeastern jv for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the number of closings at our mortgage operations increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  our combined title operations capture ratio decreased to of our homebuyers for the year ended december   from for the comparable period in however  the number of closings at our title operations increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period in non affiliated customers accounted for approximately of our title company revenues for the year ended december  financial services expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is a result of higher staff levels to support increased activity 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year total revenues increased to billion during the year ended december   from billion during the year ended december  this increase is attributable to an increase in homebuilding revenues of offset by a decrease in financial services revenues 
although this was a large increase  delays related to the hurricanes in florida caused our deliveries to lag behind our expectations 
income before provision for income taxes increased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase is attributable to an increase in homebuilding pretax income to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this was partially offset by a decline in financial services pretax income to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due to increases in income in states with higher tax rates 
as a result of the above  net income increased to million or per diluted share for the year ended december   from million or per diluted share for the year ended december  results of operations homebuilding homebuilding revenues increased to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to an increase in revenues from home sales to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the increase in revenue from home sales was due to an increase in consolidated home deliveries to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively and a increase in the average selling price on consolidated homes delivered to  from  in the prior year 
a significant component of this increase was the increase in revenues from home sales in our west region for the year ended december  as compared to this increase was due to the increased number of consolidated homes delivered and the higher average selling price of such homes 
land sales increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our homebuilding gross margin increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to an increase in revenue from home sales 
our gross margin on home sales increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we generated gross margin on land sales of million as compared to million for the year ended december  sg a expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of homebuilding revenues  sg a expenses decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the basis point improvement in sg a expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues is primarily attributable to the increase in homebuilding revenues and our ability to generate higher revenue levels while leveraging fixed sg a costs 
the combination of improved gross margins and reduced sg a expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues caused our homebuilding pretax income as a percentage of homebuilding revenues to increase to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales for the year ended december  decreased to  as compared to for the prior year 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized a compensation charge of million and million  respectively  for variable accounting of certain stock based awards which include performance based accelerated vesting criteria that were partially vested during the year 
for the year ended december   income from joint ventures of million includes our share of net earnings from these entities and management fees 
net sales orders and backlog homes consolidated for the year ended december   net sales orders increased by and the value of net sales orders increased by  as compared to the increase is due to strong housing demand in the majority of our markets and an increase in the number of communities in which we are marketing 
the average sales price on net sales orders increased by to  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  we had  homes in backlog  as of december   as compared to  homes in backlog as of december  this increase in backlog of is primarily attributable to the increased sales activity in many of our existing markets 
as a result of the strong housing demand in these markets  we have been able to increase prices in those markets and have experienced a change in the product mix of our homes in backlog 
consequently  our average selling price of homes in backlog has increased to  as of december  from  as of december  the increase in homes in backlog was also partially due to fourth quarter delays in delivering homes in several of our markets 
financial services financial services revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the number of closings at our title and mortgage operations and reduced gains in selling mortgages in the secondary market caused by a shift toward more adjustable rate mortgage loans and market reductions in the interest margin 
for the year ended december   our mix of mortgage originations was adjustable rate mortgages of which approximately half were interest only and fixed rate mortgages  which is a shift from the comparable period in the prior year of adjustable rate mortgages and fixed rate mortgages 
the average fico score of our homebuyers during the year ended december  was and the average loan to value ratio on first mortgages was 
during the year ended december   approximately of our homebuyers paid in cash as compared to during the year ended december  our mortgage operations capture ratio for non cash homebuyers decreased to for the year ended december   from in the number of closings at our mortgage operations decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in the number of homebuyers paying in cash 
our title operations capture ratio increased to of our homebuyers for the year ended december   from in however  the number of closings at our title operations decreased to  for the year ended december   from  for primarily due to a decrease in refinancing transactions by non affiliated customers 
non affiliated customers accounted for approximately of our title company revenues for the year ended december  financial services expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is a result of higher staff levels and million in moving costs and employee separation expenses incurred in connection with the relocation of our mortgage company headquarters to tampa  florida 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our homebuilding operations primary uses of cash have been for land acquisitions  construction and development expenditures  joint venture investments  and sg a expenditures 
our sources of cash to finance these uses have been primarily cash generated from operations and cash from our financing activities 
our financial services operations primarily use cash to fund mortgages  prior to their sale  and sg a expenditures 
we rely primarily on internally generated funds  which include the proceeds generated from the sale of mortgages  and from the mortgage operations warehouse lines of credit to fund these operations 
at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at december  our net income generally is our most significant source of operating cash flow 
however  because of our rapid growth in recent periods  our operations have generally used more cash than they have generated 
we expect this trend to continue 
as a result  cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in the use of cash in operating activities primarily is due to an increase of million in additional inventory to support our growth 
these expenditures have been financed by retaining earnings and with the issuance of common stock 
cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in the use of cash in investing activities primarily is due to an additional million spent for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures including million associated with the transeastern jv and an additional million in loans to the transeastern jv during the year ended december  on september   pursuant to an underwritten public offering  we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering to us were million  after deducting offering costs and underwriting fees of million 
the offering proceeds were used to pay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
financing activities our consolidated borrowings at december  were million  up from million at december  at december   our homebuilding borrowings of million included million in senior notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  million of senior subordinated notes due  and million of revolving credit facility borrowings which bear interest at the reserve adjusted eurodollar base rate plus 
our weighted average debt to maturity is years  while our average inventory turnover is times per year 
our outstanding senior notes are guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by the guarantor subsidiaries  which are all of our material direct and indirect subsidiaries  other than our mortgage and title operations subsidiaries the non guarantor subsidiaries 
our outstanding senior subordinated notes are guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by all of the guarantor subsidiaries 
the senior notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to the senior subordinated notes and any future subordinated debt 
the senior subordinated notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured senior subordinated debt 
the indentures governing the senior notes and senior subordinated notes require us to maintain a minimum net worth and place certain restrictions on our ability  among other things  to incur additional debt other than under our revolving credit facility  pay or make dividends or other distributions  sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  invest in joint ventures above specified amounts  and merge or consolidate with other entities 
interest on our outstanding senior notes and senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually each year 
our financial leverage  as measured by the ratio of homebuilding net debt to capital  decreased slightly to at december  from at december   due primarily to the issuance of common stock and the retention of earnings 
as noted above  however  we have made significant investments in inventory consistent with our growth strategy which we have financed  in part  through debt  additional equity  and internally generated cash 
we believe that our financial leverage is appropriate given our industry  size and current growth strategy 
homebuilding net debt to capital december  december  dollars in millions notes payable bank borrowings homebuilding borrowings less unrestricted cash homebuilding net debt stockholders equity total capital ratio does not include obligations for inventory not owned of million at december  and million at december   all of which are non recourse to us 
does not include financial services bank borrowings of million at december  and million at december  homebuilding net debt to capital is not a financial measure required by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and other companies may calculate it differently 
we have included this information as we believe that the ratio of homebuilding net debt to capital provides comparability among other publicly traded homebuilders 
in addition  management uses this information in measuring the financial leverage of our homebuilding operations  which is our primary business 
homebuilding net debt to capital has limitations as a measure of financial leverage because it excludes financial services bank borrowings and it reduces our homebuilding debt by the amount of our unrestricted cash 
management compensates for these limitations by using homebuilding net debt to capital as only one of several comparative tools  together with gaap measurements  to assist in the evaluation of our financial leverage 
it should not be construed as an indication of our operating performance or as a measure of our liquidity 
on march   we entered into a new unsecured credit facility replacing our previous million revolving credit facility 
our new revolving credit facility is substantially similar to our prior revolving credit facility but permits us to borrow up to the lesser of i million or ii our borrowing base calculated in accordance with the revolving credit facility agreement minus our outstanding senior debt 
the facility has a letter of credit subfacility of million 
in addition  we have the right to increase the size of the facility to provide up to an additional million of revolving loans  provided we give business days notice of our intention to increase the size of the facility and we meet the following conditions i at the time of and after giving effect to the increase  we are in pro forma compliance with our financial covenants  ii no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the increase  and iii the conditions precedent to a borrowing are satisfied as of such date 
the revolving credit facility expires on march   at which time we will be required to repay all outstanding principal 
loans outstanding under the facility may be base rate loans or eurodollar loans  at our election 
base rate loans accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to i an applicable margin plus ii the higher of a citicorp s base rate or b plus the federal funds rate 
eurodollar loans accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to i an applicable margin plus ii the reserve adjusted eurodollar base rate for the interest period 
applicable margins will be adjusted based on the ratio of our liabilities net of our unrestricted cash in excess of million to our adjusted tangible net worth or our senior debt rating 
the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios regarding leverage  interest coverage  adjusted tangible net worth and certain operational measurements 
the revolving credit facility also places certain restrictions on  among other things  our ability to pay or make dividends or other distributions  create or permit certain liens  make investments in joint ventures  enter into transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with other entities 
our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries  other than our mortgage and title subsidiaries unrestricted subsidiaries 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our prior revolving credit facility  and had issued letters of credit totaling million 
as of march   we had million outstanding under our new revolving credit facility  and had issued letters of credit totaling million 
therefore  as of march   we had million remaining in availability under the new revolving credit facility  all of which we could have borrowed without violating any of our debt covenants 
our mortgage subsidiary has the ability to borrow up to million under two warehouse lines of credit to fund the origination of residential mortgage loans 
the primary revolving warehouse line of credit the primary warehouse line of credit provides for revolving loans of up to million 
the primary warehouse line of credit expires on december  the primary warehouse line of credit bears interest at the day libor rate plus a margin of to  except for certain specialty mortgage loans  determined based upon the type of mortgage loans being financed 
the primary warehouse line of credit also places certain restrictions on  among other things  our mortgage subsidiary s ability to incur additional debt  create liens  pay or make dividends or other distributions  make equity investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  and merge or consolidate with other entities 
our mortgage subsidiary s other warehouse line of credit the secondary warehouse line of credit is comprised of a credit facility providing for revolving loans of up to million  subject to meeting borrowing base requirements based on the value of collateral provided  and a recently added mortgage loan purchase and sale agreement which provides for the purchase by the lender of up to million in mortgage loans generated by our mortgage subsidiary 
at no time may the amount outstanding under this secondary warehouse line of credit plus the amount of purchased loans pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement exceed million 
the secondary warehouse line of credit is used to fund the origination of residential mortgage loans in addition to the primary warehouse line of credit 
the secondary warehouse line of credit bears interest at the day libor rate plus a margin of and expires february  both lines of credit are secured by funded mortgages  which are pledged as collateral  and require our mortgage subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios and minimums 
at december   we had million in borrowings under our mortgage subsidiary s warehouse lines of credit 
we believe that we have adequate financial resources  including unrestricted cash  availability under our current revolving credit facility and the warehouse lines of credit  and relationships with financial partners to meet our current and anticipated working capital  land acquisition and development needs and our estimated consolidated annual debt service payments of million at december   based on the outstanding balances and interest rates as of such date 
however  there can be no assurance that the amounts available from such sources will be sufficient 
if we identify new acquisition opportunities  or if our operations do not generate sufficient cash from operations at levels currently anticipated  we may seek additional debt or equity financing to operate or expand our business 
at december   the amount of our annual debt service payments was million 
this amount included annual debt service payments on the senior and senior subordinated notes of million and interest payments on the revolving credit facility  the warehouse lines of credit  and other notes of million based on the balances outstanding as of december  the amount of our annual debt service payments on the revolving credit facility fluctuates based on the principal outstanding under the facility and the interest rate 
an increase or decrease of in interest rates will change our annual debt service payment by million per year 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  dollars in millions payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s statement of financial condition under gaap total does not include obligations for inventory not owned of million at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for more information on obligations for inventory not owned 
represents borrowings under the financial services warehouse lines of credit outstanding at december  includes million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes 
does not include aggregate annual interest of million on such senior and senior subordinated notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for more information on the senior and senior subordinated notes 
represents borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december  off balance sheet arrangements land and homesite option contracts we enter into land and homesite option contracts to procure land or homesites for the construction of homes 
option contracts generally require the payment of cash or the posting of a letter of credit for the right to acquire land or homesites during a specified period of time at a certain price 
option contracts allow us to control significant homesite positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risk associated with land ownership and development 
at december   we had refundable and non refundable deposits of million and had issued letters of credit of approximately million associated with our option contracts 
the financial exposure for nonperformance on our part in these transactions generally is limited to our deposits and or letters of credit 
additionally  at december   we had performance surety bonds outstanding of approximately million and letters of credit outstanding of approximately million primarily related to land development activities 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures we have entered  and expect to continue to enter  into joint ventures that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations and or that also build and market homes for sale to third parties 
through joint ventures  we reduce and share our risk associated with land ownership and development and extend our capital resources 
our partners in these joint ventures generally are unrelated homebuilders  land sellers  financial investors or other real estate entities 
in joint ventures where the assets are being financed with debt  the borrowings are non recourse to us except that we have agreed to complete certain property development commitments in the event the joint ventures default and to indemnify the lenders for losses resulting from fraud  misappropriation and similar acts 
at december   we had investments in unconsolidated joint ventures of million 
we account for these investments under the equity method of accounting 
these unconsolidated joint ventures are limited liability companies or limited partnerships in which we have a limited partnership interest and a minority interest in the general partner 
at december   we had receivables of million from these joint ventures due to loans and advances  unpaid management fees and other items 
the debt covenants under our new revolving credit facility contain limitations on the amount of our direct cash investments in joint ventures 
we believe that the use of off balance sheet arrangements enables us to acquire rights in land which we may not have otherwise been able to acquire at favorable terms 
as a result  we view the use of off balance sheet arrangements as beneficial to our homebuilding activities 
dividends we paid aggregate cash dividends of per share of common stock during the year ended december  and per share of common stock during the year ended december  we did not declare or pay any dividends during the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes accounting standards for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
in particular  this statement requires companies to record compensation expense for all share based payments  such as employee stock options  at fair market value 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  as a result  beginning january   we will adopt sfas r and begin reflecting the stock option expense determined under fair value based methods in our income statement rather than as pro forma disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
we expect the effect of adopting sfas r to be similar to the effect represented in our proforma disclosure related to sfas on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 application of accounting principles to loan commitments sab no 
 which provides guidance regarding interest rate lock commitments irlcs that are accounted for as derivative instruments under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

in sab no 
 the commission stated that the value of expected future cash flows related to servicing rights and other intangible components should be excluded when determining the fair value of the derivative irlcs and such value should not be recognized until the underlying loans are sold 
this guidance must be applied to irlcs initiated after march  our irlcs were directly offset by forward trades  accordingly  the implementation of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on june   the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
the scope of eitf is limited to limited partnerships or similar entities such as limited liability companies that have governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership that are not vies under fin r and provides a new framework for addressing when a general partner in a limited partnership  or managing member in the case of a limited liability company  controls the entity 
eitf is effective after june  for new entities formed after such date and for existing entities for which agreements are subsequently modified and is effective for us on january  for all other entities 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of eitf with respect to our agreements entered into prior to june  will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality of operations the homebuilding industry tends to be seasonal  as generally there are more homes sold in the spring and summer months when the weather is milder  although the number of sales contracts for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings 
because new home deliveries trail new home contracts by a number of months  we typically have the greatest percentage of home deliveries in the fall and winter  and slow sales in the spring and summer months could negatively affect our full year results 
we operate primarily in the southwest and southeast  where weather conditions are more suitable to a year round construction process than in other parts of the country 
our operations in florida and texas are at risk of repeated and potentially prolonged disruptions during the atlantic hurricane season  which lasts from june until november item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of the senior and senior subordinated notes offerings  million of our outstanding borrowings are based on fixed interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our warehouse lines of credit and revolving credit facility 
the interest rates relative to these borrowings fluctuate with the prime  federal funds  libor  and eurodollar lending rates 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million drawn under our revolving credit facility and warehouse lines of credit that are subject to changes in interest rates 
an increase or decrease of in interest rates will change our annual debt service payments by million per year as a result of our bank loan arrangements that are subject to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates associated with our long term debt instruments assuming our actual level of long term debt indebtedness as of december  expected maturity date in millions thereafter fair value liabilities long term debt fixed rate fixed rate fixed rate variable rate  credit facility at december  variable rate  warehouse line of credit at december  our operations are interest rate sensitive as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  this may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates also increase our borrowing costs because  as indicated above  our bank loans will fluctuate with the prime  federal funds  libor  and eurodollar lending rates 
we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
in addition  inflation may result in higher interest rates 
this may significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing for prospective purchasers  which in turn adversely affects overall housing demand 
in addition  this may increase our interest costs 
we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased selling prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations
