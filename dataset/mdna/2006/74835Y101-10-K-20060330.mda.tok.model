item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as those discussed in any documents incorporated by reference herein or therein 
when used in this annual report  the terms questcor  company  we  our  ours and us refer to questcor pharmaceuticals  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on novel therapeutics for the treatment of diseases and disorders of the central nervous system cns 
our current commercial cns product is hp acthar gel acthar  an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain cns disorders with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of flares associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and is also commonly used in treating patients with infantile spasm  an epileptic syndrome 
we announced our cns strategy in april as part of this strategy  we intend to pursue the licensing and acquisition of additional cns commercial products  the development of new products that have the potential to address unmet medical needs in the cns field  using both our own intellectual property and intellectual property acquired or licensed from other companies  and selected opportunities to co promote cns commercial products of other pharmaceutical companies 
we have achieved the following objectives as part of our cns strategy assembled an experienced management team with extensive specialty pharmaceutical and cns experience  divested our non core product lines to provide capital to expand our business  expanded our sales organization to effectively cover the nationwide audience of physicians who are current and potential high prescribers of acthar and other products that treat cns disorders  and improved our capital structure by eliminating our outstanding debt and series b convertible preferred stock 
our management team has extensive specialty pharmaceutical experience and experience in the cns field 
our new management team consists of mr 
james l 
fares  our president and chief executive officer  who joined us in february  mr 
steve cartt  our executive vice president of commercial development  who joined us in march  mr 
craig chambliss  our vice president of sales and marketing  who joined us in may  mr 
david medeiros  our vice president of pharmaceutical operations  who was appointed an officer in may and mr 
george stuart  our vice president of finance and chief financial officer  who joined us in september in connection with our strategy to focus our efforts on promoting acthar and building a cns product portfolio  in october we sold our non core pharmaceutical product lines nascobal  ethamolin and glofil which resulted in net proceeds of million 
this transaction provides us with capital to help us expand our cns product portfolio and fund our on going operations 
we are currently evaluating a number of potential opportunities to acquire  license  develop  and co promote products for cns disorders that will fit our capital structure and commercial infrastructure 
we have also expanded our sales organization from to field based sales representatives and sales management personnel throughout the us to effectively cover the nationwide audience of physicians who are current and potential high prescribers of acthar and other products that treat cns disorders 
this sales force expansion allows us to concentrate more resources on our promotion of acthar and provides the initial sales 
table of contents infrastructure to promote cns products we may acquire  develop  or co promote in the future 
the expanded sales organization will be trained and fully deployed beginning with the second quarter of we have completed several transactions that have improved our capital structure and financial position 
during  we retired million of convertible debentures and million in debt 
in january  we redeemed all of our outstanding series b convertible preferred stock for million  which eliminated the series b convertible preferred stock from our capital structure and with it the series b cash dividend obligation of in each of and and thereafter  the series b liquidation preference and the series b restrictive covenants 
as a result of these transactions we no longer have any financial instruments that require interest or dividend payments or contain restrictive operating covenants 
our interest and dividends under these arrangements totaled  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe our improved financial position will allow us to concentrate our resources on implementing our cns strategy and lower our cost of capital 
we believe we are now well positioned to increase demand for acthar  invest in currently marketed products  and add development programs as we further our goal of building a leading cns focused specialty pharmaceutical company 
we have a registered trademark on hp acthar gel 
we also have an unregistered trademark on emitasol tm  an intranasal form of metoclopromide  which is an antiemetic 
each other trademark  trade name or service mark appearing in this document belongs to its respective holder 
questcor resulted from a merger between cypros pharmaceutical corporation and ribogene  inc ribogene 
the merger was completed on november  our principal office is located at whipple road  union city  california and our telephone number is our corporate internet address is www

we do not intend for the information contained on our website to be part of this annual report 
strategy we believe that our ability to focus our promotional  product acquisition and product development efforts exclusively on the development and commercialization of products that treat cns diseases and disorders positions us for growth 
the key elements of our strategy include increase sales of acthar through targeted promotion 
we seek to increase sales of acthar by promoting to the nationwide audience of physicians who are current and potential high prescribers of acthar through our expanded sales organization 
license  acquire  or co promote additional commercial products 
we seek to license  acquire  or co promote additional commercial products that will i benefit from increased marketing efforts directed at neurologists and other select healthcare providers  ii leverage our existing sales infrastructure  iii complement our therapeutic focus on neurology  and iv ultimately improve our operating results 
develop  acquire  or license new or improved formulations of prescription products 
we seek to develop  acquire or license new or improved formulations of prescription products that will i complement our target therapeutic area and sales strategy ii generally be in the later stages of development  and iii require lower capital investment when compared to traditional pre clinical development programs 
we intend to fund our strategic activities with cash generated from the divestment of non core assets  operations  capital raised through the sale of equity on terms acceptable to us  corporate collaborations  or debt financings 
hp acthar gel hp acthar gel is a natural source  highly purified preparation of the adrenal corticotropin hormone acth  which we acquired in july unlike synthetic acth  acthar is specially formulated to provide prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous injection 
it works by stimulating the adrenal cortex to 
table of contents secrete the natural endogenous corticosteroids  including cortisol  corticosterone  aldosterone  and a number of weakly androgenic substances 
acthar is used in a wide variety of conditions  including the treatment of infantile spasm is  periodic flares associated with ms  and various forms of arthritis  collectively called joint pain 
although the food and drug administration fda approved package labeling does not mention is  acthar has been used to treat this condition 
we believe is is a disease with an unmet medical need requiring acthar treatment 
is is an epileptic syndrome characterized by the triad of infantile spasm generalized seizures  hypsarrhythmia and arrest of psychomotor development at seizure onset 
we estimate that as many as  children annually experience bouts of this devastating syndrome in the us in of children with is  the spasms occur during the first year of life  typically between to months of age 
the first onset rarely occurs after the age of two 
patients left untreated or treated inadequately have a poor prognosis for intellectual and functional development 
about two thirds of patients are neurologically impaired prior to the onset of is  while one third are otherwise normal 
rapid and aggressive therapy to control the abnormal seizure activity appears to improve the chances that these children will develop to their fullest potential 
the market for is therapies has not changed much over the last several years 
acthar remains the treatment of choice  however  acthar s availability in the several years before our acquisition of the drug from aventis pharmaceuticals  inc aventis  now zlb behring was very restricted 
as such  many physicians used synthetic steroids and unapproved products 
a symposium on is  sponsored by the child neurology society  discussed the fact that there has been no clinical evidence to show that any therapy is better than acthar for the treatment of is 
the proceedings of that symposium have been made available to all pediatric neurologists as a continuing medical education monograph 
acthar is indicated for use in acute exacerbations of ms and is prescribed currently for patients that have ms and experience painful  episodic flares 
we promote acthar as an alternative to intravenous methylprednisolone  a corticosteroid  for the treatment of exacerbations of ms 
intravenous methylprednisolone is currently the treatment of choice for this indication 
the primary advantage of acthar in this setting is that it provides the patient with the freedom and convenience of intramuscular or subcutaneous administration at home  rather than the intravenous administration of methylprednisolone in an infusion clinic setting  without sacrificing efficacy or tolerability 
acthar has other labeled indications and uses in certain endocrine disorders  rheumatic disorders  collagen diseases  allergic states  ophthalmic diseases  respiratory diseases  hematologic disorders  neoplastic diseases  edematous states  and gastrointestinal diseases 
acthar may be challenged by newer agents  such as synthetic corticosteroids  immune system suppressants known as immunosuppressants  and anti seizure medications in the case of infantile spasms and other types of anti inflammatory products for various autoimmune conditions that have inflammation as a clinical aspect of the disease 
solu medrol  the primary competitive product to acthar for the treatment of ms flare  is now available to patients after an announced shortage in for the years ended december   and  net product sales of acthar were million  million and million  respectively 
drug development our new strategy focuses on the acquisition  development  and co promotion of products that treat cns disorders 
we intend to develop new or improved formulations of prescription products that complement our target therapeutic area of neurology and that may provide more convenient dosing  improved compliance  more consistent blood levels  and easier administration 
we expect our development programs will primarily be in the later stages of development and require lower capital investment when compared to traditional pre clinical development programs 
we also own other non core technology  much of which we have licensed to others for further development and commercialization 
we have licensed our antiviral drug discovery program to rigel pharmaceuticals  inc rigel 
we may receive milestone payments or royalties should rigel progress development and ultimately 
table of contents commercialize products using the licensed technology 
however  to date  we have not received any milestone or royalty payments and there can be no assurance that we will receive any such payments in the future 
we have no current plans to further develop emitasol 
however  emitasol was developed and approved for marketing in certain countries outside of the us by corporate partners 
we may receive royalties to the extent of any sales of emitasol by our corporate partners 
however  to date  royalty payments on sales of emitasol have been minimal and there can be no assurance that we will receive any such payments in the future 
manufacturing acthar is manufactured for us by approved contract manufacturers 
in  we transferred the acthar final fill and packaging process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  chesapeake biological laboratories  inc cbl  and produced our first lot of acthar finished vials 
this transfer was approved by the fda in january our agreement with cbl extends through in  we transferred the acthar active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufacturing process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  biovectra dcl biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
the acthar api manufacturing site transfer was approved by the fda in june we have signed an agreement with biovectra  which requires minimum production totaling million during the term of the agreement 
the agreement terminates on december  and includes two one year extension options 
while we have received approval for the acthar finished vials and api transfers to new contract manufacturers  the processes used to manufacture and test acthar are complex and subject to fda inspection and approval 
acthar has a labeled shelf life of months from the date of manufacture 
we have selected a contract laboratory to perform two bioassays associated with the release of api and finished vials 
these bioassays have been successfully transferred from aventis now zlb behring to the contract laboratory  and were approved by the fda in june we experienced delays and cost overruns in the transfer and validation of a third assay  potency 
zlb behring agreed to perform any potency assays we required through in february  we extended our agreement with zlb behring through and terminated the potency assay transfer project 
the transfer of manufacturing from aventis to our new contract manufacturers is resulting in higher unit costs than the fixed price manufacturing agreement with aventis  which is decreasing our gross margins on sales of acthar 
there can be no assurance that any of our api or finished goods contract manufacturers will continue to meet our requirements for quality  quantity and timeliness or the fda s current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements 
also  there can be no assurance our contract manufacturers will be able to meet all cgmp requirements  nor that lots will not have to be recalled with the attendant financial consequences to us 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of api or finished forms of acthar  or for the manufacture of products that we may acquire or develop  may adversely affect the future profit margin on the sale of those products and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis 
we do not have substitute suppliers for acthar although we strive to plan appropriately and maintain safety stocks of product to cover unforeseen events at manufacturing sites 
in the event we are unable to manufacture our products  either directly or indirectly through others or on commercially acceptable terms  if at all  we may not be able to commercialize our products as planned 
divested product lines in connection with our strategy to focus our efforts on promoting acthar and building a cns product portfolio  on october  we sold our non core pharmaceutical product lines nascobal  ethamolin and glofil nascobal is a prescription nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies  ethamolin is an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  and glofil is an injectable agent that assesses how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function 
our net product sales of the divested product lines were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
effective october   our results of operations and cash flows excluded the net product sales and direct operating costs and expenses of the divested product lines 

table of contents sales and marketing as of march   we had field based sales representatives  field based sales managers and home office sales and marketing personnel to support the commercialization of acthar 
our promotion and educational efforts for acthar are focused on pediatric neurologists and on a subset of high potential neurologists dedicated to the treatment of multiple sclerosis in adults 
acthar is approved for sale in the us however  we also have agreements with the following companies to market and distribute acthar on a named patient basis in certain other countries 
beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
we have an agreement with beacon pharmaceuticals  ltd 
beacon of tunbridge wells  kent  uk  for the exclusive marketing and distribution of acthar in the united kingdom on a named patient basis 
sales to beacon were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
idis limited we have an agreement with idis limited idis of sirbiton  surrey  uk for the exclusive distribution of acthar on a named patient basis 
the agreement covers all countries of the world except the united states  australia and new zealand  and the uk  where acthar is sold through beacon 
sales to idis were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
there are products and treatments on the market that compete with acthar 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by our competitors  which may prevent us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products that address critical medical needs  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and secure sufficient capital resources for the acquisition and commercialization of products 
most of our competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial  marketing and technical resources than we have 
furthermore  if we commence commercial sales of products that we may develop  should they be approved  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have limited experience 
if any of the competitors develop new products that are superior to our products  our ability to expand into the pharmaceutical markets may be materially and adversely affected 
competition among products will be based  among other things  on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price and patent position 
an important factor will be the timing of market introduction of our or our competitors products 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can acquire products and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is expected to be an important competitive factor 
government regulation marketed pharmaceutical products all pharmaceutical operations associated with the production  testing  packaging and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the fda 
any restrictions or prohibitions applicable to sales of products we market could materially and adversely affect our business 
we market prescription drug products that have been approved by the fda 
the fda has the authority to revoke existing approvals if new information reveals that they are not safe or effective 
the fda also regulates the promotion  including advertisement  of prescription drugs 

table of contents drug products must be manufactured  tested  packaged  and labeled in accordance with their approvals and in conformity with cgmp standards and other requirements 
drug manufacturing facilities must be registered with and approved by the fda and must list with the fda the drug products they intend to manufacture or distribute 
the manufacturer is subject to inspections by the fda and periodic inspections by other regulatory agencies 
the fda has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers  including authority to seize and prohibit the sale of unapproved or non complying products  and to halt any pharmaceutical operations that are not in compliance with cgmps 
the fda may impose criminal penalties arising from non compliance with applicable regulations 
drugs in development products in development are subject to extensive regulation by the us  principally under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act  and if applicable by foreign governmental authorities 
in particular  drugs and biological products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval requirements by the fda  state and local authorities and comparable foreign regulatory authorities 
the process for obtaining the required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities takes many years and is very expensive 
there can be no assurance that any product developed by us and current or potential development partners will prove to meet all of the applicable standards to receive marketing approval in the us or abroad 
there can be no assurance that these approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays and costs in obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal  state and local statutes and regulations could materially adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products and our ability to earn sales revenues 
product liability insurance the clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of acthar and products that we may acquire or develop may expose us to product liability claims  against which we maintain liability insurance 
see item a risk factors if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products for a discussion of certain risks related to product liability claims that may be made against us 
patents and proprietary rights our success may depend in part upon our ability to maintain confidentiality  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties  and obtain patent protection for our products 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
we do not have a patent on acthar 
we own issued us and foreign patents covering our other technology 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services 
unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products  services or proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as we expand our product and service offerings and the number of competitors increases 
defending against these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease using the applications that contain the infringing technology or content 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or content or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
see item a risk factors if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues for a discussion of additional risks related to intellectual property rights 

table of contents employees at december   we had full time employees as compared to full time employees at december  
our success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain key employees 
at december   we had employees engaged directly in the marketing and selling of our product 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced work stoppages

financial information please refer to item  selected consolidated financial data  and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a review of revenue  net income loss  and total assets for the three years ended december  item a 
risk factors we have a history of operating losses and may never generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability 
we have a history of recurring operating losses  and our accumulated deficit through december  was million 
we recognized net income applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  of million  however  this included a one time gain of million on the divestment of our non core product lines 
our net loss applicable to common shareholders was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
to date  our revenues have been generated principally from sales of acthar  nascobal  ethamolin  glofil  inulin and vsl in october  we sold the nascobal  ethamolin and glofil product lines  and accordingly we are no longer selling such products 
our agreement to promote vsl expired in january  and we are no longer selling vsl we discontinued selling inulin in september our ability to achieve a consistent  profitable level of operations will be dependent in large part upon our ability to develop  finance and implement an effective promotional strategy for acthar  finance and acquire additional commercial products  finance operations until consistent positive cash flows are achieved  continue to receive finished product and api from our sole source contract manufacturers on a timely basis and at acceptable costs  continue to control our operating expenses  and ensure customers compliance with our sales and product return policies 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from sales of acthar  or if we are unable to contain costs and expenses  we may not achieve profitability and may ultimately be unable to fund our operations 
if our revenues from sales of acthar decline or fail to grow  we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
we currently rely exclusively on sales of acthar 
we expect to continue to rely on sales of this product in the foreseeable future 
we review external data sources to estimate customer demand for acthar 
in the event that demand for acthar is less than our sales to wholesalers  excess inventory may result at the wholesaler level  which may impact future product sales 
we monitor the amount of acthar at the wholesale level as well as prescription data obtained from third party sources to help assess product demand 
although our goal is to actively promote acthar  and we have no reason to 
table of contents believe that our promotion of acthar will not be successful  we cannot predict whether the demand for acthar will continue in the future or that we will continue to generate significant revenues from sales of acthar 
we may choose  in the future  to reallocate our sales and promotion efforts for acthar which may result in a decrease in revenues from this product 
if the demand for acthar declines  or if we are forced to reduce the price  or if returns of expired products are higher than anticipated  or if we are forced to re negotiate contracts or terms  or if our customers do not comply with our existing policies  our revenues from the sale of acthar would decline 
if the cost to produce acthar increases  and we are unable to raise the price correspondingly  our gross margins on the sale of acthar would decline 
if our revenues from the sale of acthar decline or fail to grow  our total revenues  gross margins and operating results would be harmed and we may not have sufficient revenues to fund our operations 
our business will be harmed if we are unable to implement our growth strategy successfully 
our growth strategy primarily includes the following components initially focusing our promotional efforts on acthar  our cns product  acquiring additional commercial products that have sales growth potential  are promotionally responsive to a focused and targeted sales and marketing effort  complement our therapeutic focus on neurology and can be acquired at a reasonable valuation relative to our cost of capital  and developing new medications focused in cns with our corporate resources and through corporate collaborations 
any failure on our part to implement any or all of our growth strategies successfully would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have little or no control over our wholesalers buying patterns  which may impact future revenues  returns and excess inventory 
we sell acthar primarily through major drug wholesalers located in the united states 
consistent with the pharmaceutical industry  most of our revenues are derived from the three largest drug wholesalers 
these wholesalers represented of our gross product sales for the year ended december  while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of acthar at the three largest wholesalers using inventory data obtained from them  historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
we rely solely upon the wholesalers to effect the distribution allocation of acthar 
there can be no assurance that these wholesalers will adequately manage their local and regional inventories to avoid outages or inventory build ups 
on occasion we note that the wholesalers buy quantities of product in excess of the quantities being sold by them  resulting in increasing inventories 
acthar has an expiration date that is months from date of manufacture 
we will generally accept for credit pharmaceutical products returned within the six month period following the expiration date 
we establish reserves for these credit memoranda at the time of sale 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately forecast the reserve requirements needed to provide for credit memoranda issued in the future 
although our estimates are reviewed quarterly for reasonableness  our product return activity could differ significantly from our estimates because our analyses of product shipments  prescription trends and the amount of product in the distribution channel may not be accurate 
judgment is required in estimating these reserves 
actual amounts could be significantly different from the estimates and such differences are accounted for in the period in which they become known 
we do not control or significantly influence the purchasing patterns of the drug wholesalers who purchase acthar 
these wholesalers are sophisticated companies that purchase our product in a manner consistent with their industry practices and perceived business interests 
our sales are subject to the purchase requirements of the major wholesalers  which  presumably  are based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any customer  during any period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of our product during the same period  resulting in increases or decreases in product inventory existing in the distribution channel 
we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or otherwise impaired inventory 
reserves for excess finished goods and work in process inventories are based on an analysis of expected future sales that will occur before the 
table of contents inventory on hand expires 
reserves for raw material inventories are based on viability and projected future use 
judgment is required in estimating reserves for excess or impaired inventories 
actual amounts of required reserves could be different from the estimates and such differences are accounted for in the period in which they become known 
our inability to secure additional funding could lead to a loss of your investment 
we anticipate that our capital resources based on our internal forecasts and projections will be adequate to fund operations and capital expenditures through at least december  if we experience unanticipated cash requirements and if revenues are less than we expect  we could be required to raise additional capital 
regardless  we may seek additional funds before december   through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
additionally  we may seek to raise capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
there can be no assurance that additional funds can be obtained on desirable terms or at all 
if revenues from product sales are less than we expect or if further capital resources are not available  or if such resources cannot be obtained on attractive terms to us  this may further limit our ability to fund operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following existing product sales performance  successfully implementing our growth strategy  achieving better operating efficiencies  maintaining customer compliance with our policies  obtaining product from our sole source contract manufacturers  and acquiring or developing additional products 
we may obtain additional financing through public or private debt or equity financings 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
further  additional equity financings will be dilutive to our stockholders 
if sufficient capital is not available  then we may be required to reduce our operations or to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our products or manufacturing efforts 
if we are unable to contract with third party contract manufacturers  we may be unable to meet the demand for our products and lose potential revenues 
we rely on contract manufacturers to produce our marketed product  acthar  and will likely do the same for other products that we may develop  commercialize or acquire in the future 
contract manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  cost  quantity or quality 
all our manufacturers are sole source manufacturers and no currently qualified alternative suppliers exist 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of our required products and services on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with our manufacturers  or if the required approvals by the fda and other regulatory authorities do not occur on a timely basis  we will lose sales 
moreover  contract manufacturers that we may use must continually adhere to current good manufacturing practices enforced by the fda 
if the facilities of these manufacturers cannot pass an inspection  we may lose fda approval of our products 
failure to obtain products for sale for any reason may result in an inability to meet product demand and a loss of potential revenues 
if our third party distributors are unable to distribute our product or the costs to distribute our product increases substantially  we will lose potential revenues and profits 
we transferred certain product distribution functions  including warehousing  shipping and quality control studies  to third party distributors 
the outsourcing of these functions is complex  and we may experience difficulties at the third party contractor level that could reduce  delay or stop shipments of our product 
if we 
table of contents encounter such distribution problems  our product could become unavailable and we could lose revenues  or the costs to distribute our product could become higher than we anticipated 
for the year ended december   of our gross product sales were derived from the three largest drug wholesalers 
two of these three wholesalers mandate a distribution fee for handling our product 
if other wholesalers institute similar fees  or if such fees increase in magnitude in the future  our costs to distribute our product will increase  and our gross profit margins will decline 
we have experienced changes in key personnel which will have an uncertain impact on future operations 
on february   mr 
james l 
fares was named president and chief executive officer  succeeding mr 
charles j 
casamento who resigned as chairman  president and chief executive officer on august  on march   mr 
steve cartt was named executive vice president of commercial development 
we are highly dependent on the services of our president and chief executive officer  mr 
james l 
fares and our executive vice president of commercial development  mr 
steve cartt 
if we were to lose mr 
fares or mr 
cartt as employees  our business could be harmed 
we do not carry key person life insurance for our senior management or other personnel 
additionally  the future potential growth and expansion of our business is expected to place increased demands on our management skills and resources 
although some changes in staffing levels are expected during  recruiting and retaining management and operational personnel to perform sales and marketing  financial operations  business development  regulatory affairs  quality assurance  medical affairs and contract manufacturing in the future will also be critical to our success 
we do not know if we will be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced management and operational personnel in the future on acceptable terms given the intense competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for such personnel 
if we are unable to hire necessary skilled personnel in the future  our business could be harmed 
our products may not be accepted by the market  which may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 
acthar and any products that we successfully acquire or develop in the future  if approved for marketing  may never achieve market acceptance 
these products  if successfully developed  will compete with drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and other biotechnology companies 
physicians  patients or the medical community in general may not accept and utilize the products that we may develop or that our corporate partners may develop 
the degree of market acceptance of our commercial products and any products that we successfully develop will depend on a number of factors  including the establishment and demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of the product candidates  their potential advantage over alternative treatment methods and competing products  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and our ability to market and promote the products effectively 
the failure of our products to achieve market acceptance may result in lower future revenues as well as a decline in our competitive positioning 
a large percentage of our voting stock is beneficially owned by a small number of stockholders  who in the future could attempt to take control of our management and operations or exercise voting power to advance their own best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders 
as of december   sigma tau finanziaria spa and its affiliates sigma tau beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  approximately of the voting power of our outstanding voting capital stock  and they beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
additionally  we have other stockholders who own significant amounts of our voting capital stock  as reported on various schedule d s filed with the 
table of contents securities and exchange commission 
accordingly  these stockholders  acting individually or together  could control the outcome of certain shareholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our articles of incorporation  and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this level of concentrated ownership may  at a minimum  have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in the management or voting control of us by a third party 
it may also place us in the position of having these large stockholders take control of us and having new management inserted and new objectives adopted 
if competitors develop and market products that are more effective than ours  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change 
a number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals and products that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
for example  there are products on the market that compete with acthar 
moreover  technology controlled by third parties that may be advantageous to our business may be acquired or licensed by competitors of ours  preventing us from obtaining this technology on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to compete will depend on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology  and to develop  acquire and commercialize pharmaceutical products based on this technology  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection  or otherwise develop proprietary technology or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the expected substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of products based upon our technology 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in development  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing than we do 
other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for clinical development  manufacturing  and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions will compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
we will face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  availability of resources  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
if our competitors succeed in developing technologies and drugs that are more effective or less costly than any that we develop or acquire  our technology and future drugs may be rendered obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  our competitors may succeed in obtaining the approval of the fda or other regulatory approvals for drug candidates more rapidly than we will 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before their competitors may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights that would delay our ability to market specific products 
we do not know if drugs resulting from the joint efforts of our existing or future collaborative partners will be able to compete successfully with our competitors existing products or products under development or whether we will obtain regulatory approval in the us or elsewhere 

table of contents if we fail to maintain or enter into new contracts related to collaborations and in licensed or acquired technology and products  our product development and commercialization could be delayed 
our business model has been dependent on our ability to enter into licensing and acquisition arrangements with commercial or academic entities to obtain technology for commercialization or marketed products 
if we are unable to enter into any new agreements in the future  our development and commercialization efforts will be delayed 
disputes may arise regarding the inventorship and corresponding rights in inventions and know how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors or scientific collaborators 
we may not be able to negotiate additional license and acquisition agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  current license and acquisition agreements may be terminated  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of our exclusive licenses 
if collaborators do not commit sufficient development resources  technology  regulatory expertise  manufacturing  marketing and other resources towards developing  promoting and commercializing products incorporating our discoveries  the progress of our licensed products development will be stalled 
further  competitive conflicts may arise among these third parties that could prevent them from working cooperatively with us 
the amount and timing of resources devoted to these activities by the parties could depend on the achievement of milestones by us and otherwise generally may be controlled by other parties 
in addition  we expect that our agreements with future collaborators will likely permit the collaborators to terminate their agreements upon written notice to us 
this type of termination would substantially reduce the likelihood that the applicable research program or any lead candidate or candidates would be developed into a drug candidate  would obtain regulatory approvals and would be manufactured and successfully commercialized 
if none of our collaborations are successful in developing and commercializing products  or if we do not receive milestone payments or generate revenues from royalties sufficient to offset our significant investment in product development and other costs  then our business could be harmed 
disagreements with our collaborators could lead to delays or interruptions in  or termination of  development and commercialization of certain potential products or could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which could be time consuming and expensive and may result in lost revenues and substantial legal costs which could negatively impact our results from operations 
in addition  if we are unable to acquire new marketed products on a timely basis at an appropriate purchase price and terms  we may not reach profitability and may not generate sufficient cash to fund operations 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may lose our competitive position and future revenues 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents for our products and technologies  protect trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and are otherwise protectable under applicable law 
we will attempt to protect our proprietary position by filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products  technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
the patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patents that we own or license from third parties may not provide any protection against competitors 
pending patent applications we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties  may not result in patents being issued 
also  patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will 
table of contents develop 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we currently seek protection  in part  through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information 
the parties may not comply with or may breach these agreements 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or be independently developed by competitors 
our success will further depend  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
if our activities infringe on patents owned by others  we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against a licensor or us 
should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties  the manufacture  use and sale of our products could be enjoined  and we could be required to pay substantial damages 
in addition  we  in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies  may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  which may not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
since we must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products 
any products that we develop are subject to regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by similar agencies in other countries 
any product that we develop must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances before it may be marketed in a particular country 
the regulatory process  which includes extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy  is uncertain  can take many years  and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance for a product 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances could stall the marketing  selling and distribution of any products that our corporate partners or we develop  impose significant additional costs on our corporate partners and us  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our corporate partners may attain  and decrease our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
regulatory approval  if granted  may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which a new product may be marketed that could limit the potential market for the product 
product approvals  once granted  may be withdrawn if problems occur after initial marketing 
furthermore  manufacturers of approved products are subject to pervasive review  including compliance with detailed regulations governing fda good manufacturing practices 
the fda periodically revises the good manufacturing practices regulations 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to grant marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
in addition  we cannot predict the extent of government regulations or the impact of new governmental regulations that may result in a delay in the development  production and marketing of our products 
as such  we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future laws or regulations 
our ability to generate revenues is affected by the availability of reimbursement on our product  and our ability to generate revenues will be diminished if we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our product from third party payors 
in both domestic and foreign markets  the sale of our product will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors such as state and federal governments for example  under medicare and medicaid programs in the united states and private insurance plans 
in certain foreign markets  the pricing and 
table of contents profitability of our product generally is subject to government controls 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of state and federal proposals that limit the amount that state or federal governments will pay to reimburse the cost of drugs 
we believe the increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to put pressure on the price and usage of our product  which may also impact product sales 
further  when a new therapeutic is approved  the reimbursement status and rate of such a product is uncertain 
in addition  current reimbursement policies for our existing product may change at any time 
changes in reimbursement or our failure to obtain reimbursement for our products may reduce the demand for  or the price of  our product  which could result in lower product sales or revenues  thereby weakening our competitive position and negatively impacting our results of operations 
in the united states  proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such changes enacted may require significant reductions from currently projected government expenditures for these programs 
the medicare prescription drug improvement act  enacted in december  provides for  among other things  an immediate reduction in the medicare reimbursement rates for many drugs administered in a physician s office 
the medicare act  as well as other changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for our products  may reduce or eliminate reimbursement of our products costs 
driven by budget concerns  medicaid managed care systems have been implemented in several states and local metropolitan areas 
if the medicare and medicaid programs implement changes that restrict the access of a significant population of patients to innovative medicines  the market acceptance of these products may be reduced 
we are unable to predict what impact the medicare act or other future legislation  if any  relating to third party reimbursement  will have on our product sales 
to facilitate the availability of our product for medicaid patients  we have contracted with the center for medicare and medicaid services 
as a result  we pay quarterly rebates consistent with the utilization of our product by individual states 
we also give discounts under contract on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
if these discounts and rebates become burdensome to us and we are not able to sell our product through these channels  our net sales could decline 
our business is subject to changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the american stock exchange  have recently issued new requirements and regulations and continue developing additional regulations and requirements in response to recent corporate scandals and laws enacted by congress  most notably the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue resulting in  increased general and administrative expenses and diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to prepare to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act and related regulations for fiscal years ending on or after july  regarding our management s required assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors attestation of that assessment will require the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
although management believes that ongoing efforts to assess our internal control over financial reporting will enable management to provide the required report  and our independent auditors to provide the required attestation  under section  we can give no assurance that such efforts will be completed on a timely and successful basis to enable our management and independent auditors to provide the required report and attestation in order to comply with sec rules effective for us 
moreover  because the new and changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this evolution may result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to our disclosure and governance practices 

table of contents our stock price has a history of volatility  and an investment in our stock could decline in value 
the price of our common stock  like that of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  is subject to significant volatility 
the price per share of our common stock ranged in value from to during the two year period ended december  any number of events  both internal and external to us  may continue to affect our stock price 
these include  without limitation  our quarterly and yearly revenues and earnings or losses  our ability to acquire and market appropriate pharmaceuticals  announcement by us or our competitors regarding product development efforts  including the status of regulatory approval applications  the outcome of legal proceedings  including claims filed by us against third parties to enforce our patents and claims filed by third parties against us relating to patents held by the third parties  the launch of competing products  our ability to obtain product from our contract manufacturers  the resolution of or failure to resolve disputes with collaboration partners and corporate restructuring by us 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or we become subject to other forms of litigation  we may incur substantial liabilities and costs and may be required to limit commercialization of our products 
our business will expose us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the use of any drug candidates ultimately developed by us or our collaborators in clinical trials may expose us to product liability claims and possible adverse publicity 
these risks will expand for any of our drug candidates that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale and for those products we currently market 
product liability insurance for the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive  if available at all 
we currently have product liability insurance for claims up to million 
however  if we are unable to maintain insurance coverage at acceptable costs  in a sufficient amount  or at all  or if we become subject to a product liability claim  our reputation  stock price and ability to devote the necessary resources to the commercialization of our products could be negatively impacted

we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on novel therapeutics for the treatment of diseases and disorders of the central nervous system cns 
our current commercial cns product is hp acthar gel acthar  an injectable drug that is approved for the treatment of certain cns disorders with an inflammatory component  including the treatment of flares associated with multiple sclerosis ms  and is also commonly used in treating patients with infantile spasm  an epileptic syndrome 
in connection with our strategy to focus our efforts on promoting acthar and building a cns product portfolio  in october we sold our non core pharmaceutical product lines nascobal  ethamolin and glofil to qol medical llc qol resulting in net proceeds of million and a pre tax gain of million 
our results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  include the net product sales and direct operating 
table of contents costs and expenses of the divested product lines through the divestment date of october  nascobal is a prescription nasal gel used for the treatment of various vitamin b deficiencies  ethamolin is an injectable drug used to treat enlarged weakened blood vessels at the entrance to the stomach that have recently bled  known as esophageal varices  and glofil is an injectable agent that assesses how well the kidney is working by measuring glomerular filtration rate  or kidney function 
in january  our agreement to promote and sell vsl expired in accordance with its terms 
we announced our cns strategy in april as part of this strategy  we intend to pursue the licensing and acquisition of additional cns commercial products  the development of new products that have the potential to address unmet medical needs in the cns field  using both our own intellectual property and intellectual property acquired or licensed from other companies  and selected opportunities to co promote cns commercial products of other pharmaceutical companies 
our expenditures on research and development activities to date have not been material 
expenses incurred for the acthar manufacturing site transfer that we completed in and medical and regulatory affairs activities are classified as research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we expect our research and development spending to increase in the future as we implement our cns strategy 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million at december  at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors  the results of our sales efforts  demand for our product by patients and consumers  inventory levels of our product at wholesalers  timing of expiration of our product  future credit memoranda to be issued under our credit memoranda return policy  the availability of finished goods from our sole source manufacturer  the timing of certain expenses  the acquisition of marketed products  the establishment of strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements and the receipt of milestone payments 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales reserves  product returns  bad debts  inventories  and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
sales reserves we have estimated reserves for product returns from wholesalers  hospitals and pharmacies  government chargebacks for goods purchased by certain federal government organizations including the veterans administration  medicaid rebates to all states for products purchased by patients covered by medicaid  and  cash discounts for prompt payment 
we estimate our reserves by utilizing historical information for existing products and data obtained from external sources 
significant judgment is inherent in the selection of assumptions and the interpretation of historical experience as well as the identification of external and internal factors affecting the estimates of our reserves for product returns  government chargebacks  and medicaid rebates 
we believe that the assumptions used to estimate these sales reserves are the most reasonably likely assumptions considering known facts and circumstances 
however  our product return activity  government chargebacks received  and medicaid rebates paid could differ significantly from our estimates because our analysis of product shipments  prescription trends and the amount of product in the distribution channel may not be accurate 
if actual product returns  government chargebacks  and medicaid rebates are significantly different from our estimates  or if the wholesalers fail to adhere to our product exchange or credit 
table of contents memoranda policy  such differences would be accounted for in the period in which they become known 
to date  actual amounts have been consistent with our estimates 
during the second quarter of we implemented a transition plan for expired product returns from a product exchange policy to a credit memoranda policy for the return of expired product within six months after the expiration date 
expired product returned from lots released after may  is subject to a credit memoranda policy in which a credit memoranda will be issued for the original purchase price of the returned product 
a reserve for the sales value of estimated returns on shipments of acthar product lots released and shipped after may  has been recorded as a liability in the amount of million as of december  with a corresponding reduction in gross product sales 
this reserve reflects an estimate of future credit memoranda to be issued  applied to the quantity of acthar product shipped from lots subject to the credit memoranda policy 
the reserve will be reduced as future credit memoranda are issued  with an offset to accounts receivable 
under our product exchange policy  we ship replacement product for expired product returned to us within six months after expiration 
the estimated costs for such potential exchanges  which include actual product costs and related shipping charges  are included in cost of product sales 
a reserve for estimated returns on shipments of acthar product lots released and shipped prior to june  has been recorded as a liability in the amount of  as of december  this reserve reflects an estimate of future acthar replacements  applied to the quantity of product shipped from lots subject to the product exchange policy 
the reserve will be reduced as future product replacements occur  with an offset to product inventories 
in estimating the return rate for expired product subject to credit memoranda and product exchange  we analyze i historical returns and sales patterns  ii current inventory on hand at wholesalers and the remaining shelf life of that inventory ranging from months to years for all products except glofil  which was not subject to our product return policy  and iii changes in demand measured by prescriptions or other data as provided by an independent third party source and our internal estimates 
we believe that the information obtained from wholesalers regarding inventory levels and from independent third parties regarding prescription demand is reliable  but we are unable to independently verify the accuracy of such data 
we routinely assess our historical experience including customers compliance with our product return policy  and we adjust our reserves as appropriate 
a transition period extended through between the product exchange policy  applicable to product lots released prior to june   and the credit memoranda return policy  applicable to product lots released after may  reserves for the estimated credit memoranda applicable to future returns related to sales of product lots subject to the credit memoranda policy were recorded as shipments occurred  and reduced gross product sales 
during the transition from our product exchange policy to a credit memoranda return policy for expired product in  both the product exchange policy and the credit memoranda return policy were in effect at the same time  which resulted in lower revenues than historically experienced due to the additional impact of the displacement of future sales from the product exchange policy and the reduction of gross product sales for the reserves under the credit memoranda return policy 
at december  and  sales related reserves for product returns under the credit memoranda and product exchange policies were as follows december  in s balance  beginning of year actual returns in current year related to sales from prior years actual returns in current year related to sales from current year current provision related to sales made in prior years current provision related to sales made in current year transfer of divested product line accruals balance  end of year 
table of contents activity for nascobal and ethamolin is included in the table above through october   which is the date we sold these product lines 
in connection with the sale of the nascobal  ethamolin and glofil product lines  we are responsible for all medicaid rebates and government chargebacks on our sales of these product lines through october  we are responsible for product returns on our sales of nascobal and ethamolin through october   but only to the extent the returns were authorized by january  subsequent to october   we no longer have access to nascobal and ethamolin product inventories to facilitate product replacements under our product replacement policy 
as a result  credit is provided on all returns of these products after october  the difference between the amount of credit expected to be issued on the divested products and the  accrued in our product replacement and credit memorandum reserves as of october  was considered in the determination of the computed gain on the sale of the divested products 
as of december   we had credit memorandum return reserves related to the divested product lines of  that are excluded from the end of year balance in the table above 
the increase in the provision relates to the change from the product exchange policy to the credit memoranda return policy offset by the transfer of the accruals related to our divested product lines as of october  the provision related to sales made in prior years reflects adjustments to the estimated rate of product returns and to the cost of product replacements 
in estimating medicaid rebates  we match the actual rebates to the quantity of product sold by pharmacies on a product by product basis to arrive at an actual rebate percentage 
this historical percentage is used to estimate a rebate percentage that is applied to the sales to which the rebates apply to arrive at the estimated rebate reserve for the period 
we also consider allowable prices by medicaid 
in estimating government chargeback reserves  we analyze actual chargeback amounts by product and apply historical chargeback rates to sales to which chargebacks apply 
we routinely assess our experience with medicaid rebates and government chargebacks and adjust the reserves accordingly 
for qualified customers  we grant payment terms of  net days 
allowances for cash discounts are estimated based upon the amount of trade accounts receivable subject to the cash discounts 
total sales related reserves increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in total sales related reserves includes an increase of million for reserves recorded under our credit memoranda policy in inventories we maintain inventory reserves primarily for excess and obsolete inventory due to the expiration of shelf life of a product 
in estimating inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  we analyze i the expiration date  ii our sales forecasts  and iii historical demand 
judgment is required in determining whether the forecasted sales information is sufficiently reliable to enable us to reasonably estimate excess and obsolete inventory 
if actual future usage and demand for our product is less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write offs may be required in the future 
we intend to control inventory levels of our product purchased by our customers 
customer inventories may be compared to both internal and external databases to determine adequate inventory levels 
we may monitor our product shipments to customers and compare these shipments against prescription demand for our individual products 
intangible assets in connection with the sale of the nascobal product line in october  we included the carrying value of the nascobal purchased technology totaling million in calculating the gain on the sale of product lines 
as of december   our remaining intangible asset relates to  of goodwill generated from the merger with ribogene  inc in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
our fair value is compared to the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying amount  then no impairment is indicated 
as of december   we determined that goodwill was not impaired 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  total revenues total revenues  which consisted of net product sales only  decreased for the year ended december  by million  or  from the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to the disposition of our non core product lines in october  as explained below 
net product sales by therapeutic area years ended december  increase decrease in s neurology gastroenterology nephrology total net product sales we review the amount of inventory of our products at the wholesale level in order to help assess the demand for our products 
we may choose to defer sales in situations where we believe inventory levels are already adequate 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in net product sales due to the timing of shipments  changes in wholesaler inventory levels  expiration dates of products sold  the timing of replacement units shipped under our product exchange policy  the impact of reserves provided for under our credit memoranda policy and the allocation of promotional efforts 
neurology net product sales for the years ended december  and  neurology net product sales were comprised of acthar net product sales 
for the year ended december   neurology net product sales increased  or  from the year ended december  the increase in neurology net product sales resulted from a higher average selling price of acthar during as compared to the average selling price of acthar for the year ended december  increased approximately as compared to the year ended december  the increase resulting from the higher average selling price was offset by a decrease in volume in as compared to the prior year and by higher reserves recorded as a reduction to gross sales in for returns under our credit memoranda return policy and for medicaid rebates 
our credit memo policy  which was initiated in the second quarter of  was in effect for the entire year ended december  reserves for credit memoranda for neurology products totaling million and  were recorded as a reduction to gross sales during and  respectively 
the increase in the reserve for medicaid rebates in resulted in part from a higher average per unit rebate due to acthar price increases as compared to the prior year 
the estimated demand for acthar as measured by prescriptions reported from an independent source decreased by in as compared to the prior year 
the comparative decrease results primarily from a temporary increase in demand for acthar in the fourth quarter of the higher level of volume in the fourth quarter of did not continue beyond february under our product exchange policy  we replaced  vials of acthar during and  vials of acthar during as of december   customers are due product replacements under our product exchange policy of expired acthar with a gross sales value of approximately  the replacement of expired product  at no cost to the customers  displaces sales 
we have recorded a reserve for future replacements of acthar at the estimated cost of such exchanges of  acthar has an month shelf life

the average selling price of nascobal was higher for the first nine months of as compared to same period in nascobal gross sales were reduced by reserves recorded under our credit memoranda return policy which was in effect through october  during  reserves for credit memoranda for gastroenterology products totaling  were recorded as a reduction to gross product sales

the decrease in cost of product sales is primarily due to a decrease in material costs of approximately  and other indirect costs as a result of the sale of our non core product lines in october and the inclusion of vsl direct costs in this decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately  in routine acthar stability testing costs and an increase of  in inventory obsolescence expense in as compared to stability testing is required on each production lot of acthar and is conducted at third party laboratories at periodic intervals subsequent to manufacturing 
stability testing costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect per unit material costs for acthar to increase in the future due to higher contract manufacturing and laboratory costs 
cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to lower net sales in  resulting from higher reserves recorded as a reduction to gross sales for returns under our credit memoranda return policy and for medicaid rebates

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the comparative decrease in dollars is due in part to the inclusion in of approximately  in severance and related expenses associated with the departure of our former ceo in the third quarter of and the write off of  in goodwill related to the impairment of the assembled workforce component of the goodwill in the fourth quarter of a decrease in access fees to sigma tau pharmaceuticals of  due to the expiration of our vsl co promotion agreement in january and a decrease of  in marketing expenses also contributed to the lower selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to these decreases were partially offset by expenses of  associated with our hayward sublease  and increases in legal and consulting expenses of approximately  and bad debt expense of  as compared to the year ended december  the sublease on our hayward facility terminates on july  our obligations under the hayward master lease extend through november during the fourth quarter of  the sublessee notified us that they do not intend to extend the sublease beyond the end of july the market for office and laboratory space in the area has softened significantly since we initially subleased the facility 
therefore  during the fourth quarter of we recognized a loss of  on the hayward master lease in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  as we determined that we may not be able to fully recover our lease cost over the remaining term of the master lease 
the loss represents a liability of million as of december  related to our future lease obligation  offset by the reversal of a  related net deferred rent liability 
the fair value of the liability was determined using a credit adjusted risk free rate to discount the estimated future cash flows  consisting of the minimum lease payments under the master lease  net of estimated sublease rental income that could reasonably be obtained from the property 
we will review our assumptions and estimates quarterly and revise our estimates of this liability to reflect changes in circumstances

this transfer was approved by the fda in january in  we transferred the acthar active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufacturing process from aventis to our contract manufacturer  biovectra dcl biovectra  and produced the first biovectra api lot 
the acthar api manufacturing site transfer was approved by the fda in june we have selected a contract laboratory to perform two bioassays associated with the release of api and finished vials 
these bioassays have been successfully transferred from aventis now zlb behring to the contract laboratory  and were approved by the fda in june we experienced delays and cost overruns in the validation of a third assay  potency 
zlb behring agreed to perform any potency assays we required through in february  we extended our agreement with zlb behring through and terminated the potency assay transfer project 
the transfer of manufacturing from aventis to our new contract manufacturers is resulting in higher unit costs than the fixed price manufacturing agreement with aventis  which is decreasing our gross margins on sales of acthar

our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and extent of product sales  returns of expired product  the acquisition and licensing of products  technologies or compounds  if any  our ability to manage growth  competing technological and market developments  costs involved in filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent and intellectual property claims  the receipt of licensing or milestone fees from current or future collaborative and license agreements  if established  the timing of regulatory approvals  any expansion or acceleration of our development programs  and other factors 
if our cash resources at december  are not sufficient to meet our obligations  or if we have insufficient funds to acquire additional products or expand our operations  we will seek to raise additional capital through public or private equity financing or from other sources 
however  traditional asset based debt financing has not been available on acceptable terms 
additionally  we may seek to raise additional capital whenever conditions in the financial markets are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional cash at that time 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on desirable terms or at all

sfas no 
r eliminates our ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under accounting principles board opinion apbo no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires a public entity to reflect on its income statement  instead of pro forma disclosures in its financial footnotes  the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those equity instruments 
sfas no 
r is effective generally for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  sfas no 
r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date  to awards that are unvested as of the effective date  and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under the original sfas no 
will apply this revised statement 
under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retrospective adoption options 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures for all prior periods presented 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and will adopt sfas no 
r as of the effective date

requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no
