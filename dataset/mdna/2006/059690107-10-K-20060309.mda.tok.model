item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction bancorp rhode island  inc the company  a rhode island corporation  is the holding company for bank rhode island the bank 
the company has no significant assets other than the common stock of the bank 
for this reason  substantially all of the discussion in this document relates to the operations of the bank and its subsidiaries 
the bank is a commercial bank chartered as a financial institution in the state of rhode island 
the bank pursues a community banking mission and is principally engaged in providing banking products and services to businesses and individuals in rhode island and nearby areas of massachusetts 
the bank is subject to competition from a variety of traditional and nontraditional financial service providers both within and outside of rhode island 
the bank offers a wide variety of commercial real estate  business  residential and consumer loans and leases  deposit products  nondeposit investment products  cash management and other banking products and services designed to meet the financial needs of individuals and small to mid sized businesses

the bank s deposits are insured by the fdic  subject to regulatory limits 
the bank is also a member of the fhlb 
overview the past year marked a period of significant activity  change  and challenge for the company 
the company consummated a capital offering  acquired an equipment leasing subsidiary macrolease  started a private banking group and opened two new branches 
in addition  there were changes to the company s executive management team 
for a fuller narrative commentary on these matters  refer to item  business 
the primary drivers of the company s operating income are net interest income  which is strongly affected by the net interest margin  and the quality of the company s assets 
the company s net interest income is the difference between its interest income and its cost of funds 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the year and the interest rates earned thereon 
cost of funds is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the year and the interest rates paid thereon 
because the company s assets are not identical in duration and in repricing dates to its liabilities  the spread between the two is vulnerable to changes in market interest rates as well as the overall shape of the yield curve 
these vulnerabilities are inherent to the business of banking and are commonly referred to as interest rate risk 
how to measure interest rate risk and  once measured  how much risk to take are based on numerous assumptions and other subjective judgments 
see discussion under asset and liability management 
the quality of the company s assets also influences its earnings 
loans and leases that are not being paid on a timely basis and exhibit other weaknesses can result in the loss of principal and or loss of interest income 
additionally  the company must make timely provisions to its allowance for loan and lease losses as a result of its estimates as to potential future losses  these additions  which are charged against earnings  are necessarily greater when greater potential losses are expected 
finally  the company will incur expenses as a result of resolving troubled assets 
all of these form the credit risk that the company takes on in the ordinary course of its business and is further discussed under financial condition asset quality 
the company s business strategy has been to concentrate its asset generation efforts on commercial and consumer loans and its deposit generation efforts on checking and savings accounts 
these deposit accounts are commonly referred to as core deposit accounts 
this strategy is based on the company s belief that it can distinguish itself from its larger competitors  and indeed attract customers from them  through a higher level of service and through its ability to set policies and procedures  as well as make decisions  locally 
the loan and deposit products referenced also tend to be geared more toward customers who are relationship oriented than those who are seeking stand alone or single transaction products 
the company believes that its service oriented approach enables it to compete successfully for relationship oriented customers 
additionally  the company is predominantly an urban franchise with a high concentration of businesses making deployment of funds in the commercial lending area practicable 
commercial loans are attractive  among other reasons  because of their higher yields 
similarly  core deposits are attractive because of their generally lower interest cost and potential for fee income 
in recent years  the company also has sought to leverage business opportunities presented by its customer base  franchise footprint and resources 
this year  the bank formed a private banking division and completed its first acquisition with the acquiring of an equipment leasing company located in long island  new york macrolease 
the bank will use the macrolease platform to increase its portfolio of equipment leases  but expects to generate additional income by also originating equipment leases for third parties 
the company also has introduced macrolease to the bank s commercial customers  thereby expanding the bank s product offerings 
the deposit market in rhode island is highly concentrated 
the state s three largest banks have an aggregate market share of based upon june fdic statistics  excluding one bank that draws its deposits primarily from the internet in providence and kent counties  the bank s primary marketplace 
competition for deposits has intensified during the past few years 
institutions in the market have increased their advertising and promotional product offerings  spurred on by the various new entrants into the market 
in  approximately of the company s total revenues defined as net interest income plus noninterest income are derived from its level of net interest income 
the company continued efforts to diversify its sources of revenue  with emphasis on expanding sources of noninterest income primarily fees and charges for products and services the bank offers 
the company has increased its percentage of noninterest income to total revenue from in  to in  as the company experienced growth in the area of commissions on loans and leases originated for third parties and loan related fees 
during  lower yielding liquid savings accounts such as money market and now accounts declined  however core deposits remained flat due to moderate increases in demand deposit accounts 
the bank s deposit growth was centered in higher yielding cd s 
this shift in deposit mix has increased the bank s cost of funds 
the combination of the flattening yield curve and cost of funds increase resulted in significant pressure on the bank s net interest margin  which has negatively affected net interest income 
the bank experienced an overall decrease in net interest margin  as s net interest margin of was basis points lower than s net interest margin of 
the company anticipates that  and in particular  the flattening yield curve and shift in the deposit mix  will pose significant challenges to the company 
the future operating results of the company will again depend on the ability to maintain and expand net interest margin  while minimizing exposure to credit risk  along with increasing sources of noninterest income  while controlling the growth of noninterest or operating expenses 
critical accounting policies accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or net income  are considered critical accounting policies 
the company considers the following to be its critical accounting policies allowance for loan and lease losses and review of goodwill for impairment 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in accounting policies that require material estimates or assumptions 
allowance for loan and lease losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan and lease losses necessarily involves a significant degree of judgment 
first and foremost in arriving at an appropriate allowance is the creation and maintenance of a risk rating system that accurately classifies all loans and leases into varying categories by degree of credit risk 
such a system also establishes a level of allowance associated with each category of loans and requires early identification and reclassification of deteriorating credits 
besides numerous subjective judgments as to the number of categories  appropriate level of allowance with respect to each category and judgments as to categorization of any individual loan or lease  additional subjective judgments are involved when ascertaining the probability as well as the extent of any potential losses 
the company s ongoing evaluation process includes a formal analysis of the allowance each quarter  which considers  among other factors  the character and size of the loan and lease portfolio  business and economic conditions  loan growth  delinquency trends  nonperforming loan trends  charge off experience and other asset quality factors 
these factors are based on observable information  as well as subjective assessment and interpretation 
nonperforming commercial  commercial real estate and small business loans in excess of a specified dollar amount are deemed to be impaired 
the estimated reserves necessary for each of these credits is determined by reviewing the fair value of the collateral  the present value of expected future cash flows  and where available  the observable market price of the loans 
provisions for losses on the remaining commercial  commercial real estate  small business  residential mortgage and consumer loans and leases are based on pools of similar loans or leases using a combination of payment status  historical loss experience  industry loss experience  market economic factors  delinquency rates and qualitative adjustments 
management uses available information to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses at the level it believes is appropriate 
however  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in estimates or assumptions resulting from changes in economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
review of goodwill for impairment in march  the bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from fleet financial group  inc and related entities 
this acquisition was accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting and generated million of goodwill 
this goodwill was amortized in the years prior to  resulting in a net balance of million on the company s balance sheet as of december  effective january   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas acquisitions of certain financial institutions  the company ceased amortizing this goodwill and began to review it at least annually for impairment 
on may   the bank acquired certain operating assets from macrolease international corporation 
this acquisition was accounted for utilizing the purchase method of accounting and generated  of goodwill 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment using market value comparisons for similar institutions  such as price to earnings multiples  price to deposit multiples and price to equity multiples 
this valuation technique utilizes verifiable market multiples  as well as subjective assessment and interpretation 
the application of different market multiples  or changes in judgment as to which market transactions are reflective of the company s specific characteristics  could affect the conclusions reached regarding possible impairment 
in the event that the company were to determine that its goodwill were impaired  the recognition of an impairment charge could have an adverse impact on its results of operations in the period that the impairment occurred or on its financial position

substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if existing deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
at december   the company had million of assets that were classified as substandard 
this compares to million and million of assets that were classified as substandard at december  and  respectively 
the company had no assets that were classified as loss or doubtful at any of these dates 
performing loans may or may not be adversely classified depending upon management s judgment with respect to each individual loan 
at december   included in the million of assets that were classified as substandard  were million of performing loans 
this compares to million and million of adversely classified performing assets as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts constitute assets that  in the opinion of management  could potentially migrate to nonperforming or doubtful status 
management believes that the december  level of adversely classified assets is low relative to the size and composition of the company s loan portfolio 
as the loan and lease portfolio continues to grow and mature  or if economic conditions worsen  management believes it possible that the level of adversely classified assets will increase 
this in turn may necessitate an increase to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is established for credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio through a charge to earnings 
loans deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are added to the allowance 
amounts are charged off once the probability of loss has been established  with consideration given to such factors as the customer s financial condition  underlying collateral and guarantees  and general and industry economic conditions 
when an insured institution classifies problem loans as either substandard or doubtful  it is required to establish allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management 
additionally  general allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  and have not been allocated to particular problem loans 
the following table represents the allocation of the allowance for loan and leases losses as of the dates indicated december  percent percent percent percent percent of loans of loans of loans of loans of loans in each in each in each in each in each category category category category category to total to total to total to total to total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans dollars in thousands commercial loans and leases residential mortgage loans consumer and other loans unallocated na na na na na total assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan and leases losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge offs in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
management s methodology to estimate loss exposure includes an analysis of individual loans deemed to be impaired  reserve allocations for various loan types based on payment status or loss experience and an unallocated allowance that is maintained based on management s assessment of many factors including the growth  composition and quality of the loan portfolio  historical loss experiences  general economic conditions and other pertinent factors 
based on this evaluation  management believes that the year end allowance for loan and lease losses is appropriate 
a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is not allocated to any specific segment of the loan portfolio 
this non specific allowance is maintained for two primary reasons i there exists an inherent subjectivity and imprecision to the analytical processes employed  and ii the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
management  therefore  has established and maintains a non specific allowance for loan losses 
the amount of this measurement imprecision allocation was million at december   compared to million at december  while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan and lease losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
during  and  the bank made additions to the allowance of million   and million and experienced net charge offs of   and  respectively 
at december   the allowance for loan and leases losses stood at million and represented of nonperforming loans and of total loans outstanding 
this compares to an allowance for loan and lease losses of million  representing of nonperforming loans and of total loans outstanding at december  an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses is as follows year ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of year loans charged off commercial loans and leases residential mortgage loans consumer and other loans total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial loans and leases residential mortgage loans consumer and other loans total recoveries of loans previously charged off net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses charged against income balance at end of year net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding investments total investments consisting of overnight investments  investment securities  mbss  and fhlb stock totaled million  or of total assets  at december  this compares to total investments of million  or of total assets  as of december  the increase of million  or  was centered in growth in the investment securities  million  and mbss  million 
all million of investment securities and mbss at december  and were classified as securities available for sale 
at december   the investment portfolio carried a total net unrealized loss of million  compared to million of net unrealized gains at december   with the primary driver of the change in unrealized gain loss being the impact of rising interest rates 
the increase in total investments was driven by two primary factors 
first  leverage transactions were entered into during the second  third and fourth quarters of these transactions were undertaken to partially offset the dilution in eps resulting from the issuance of additional common stock during the second quarter of second  cash flows were temporarily held in investments before being redeployed in the bank s loan portfolio and market conditions made purchases of mbss generally more attractive than purchases of residential whole mortgage loans

overnight and short term borrowings  along with fhlb borrowings  increased million  or  during  to million  from million at december  the company had million of borrowings outstanding at the end of the increases were the result of the company utilizing borrowings to fund asset growth 
the company  through the bank s membership in the fhlb  has access to a number of different funding structures 
during  the bank also utilized wholesale repurchase agreements because of favorable spreads compared to fhlb borrowings 
on a long term basis  the company intends to continue concentrating on increasing its core deposits  but will continue to utilize fhlb borrowings or wholesale repurchase agreements as cash flows dictate and opportunities present themselves 
subordinated deferrable interest debentures on both march   and june   the company issued million of subordinated deferrable interest debentures to one of its statutory trust subsidiaries bringing its total outstanding of subordinated deferrable interest debentures to million

the company further defines liquidity as the ability to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers  as well as to earnings enhancement opportunities  in a changing marketplace 
the primary source of funds for the payment of dividends and expenses by the company is dividends paid to it by the bank 
bank regulatory authorities generally restrict the amounts available for payment of dividends if the effect thereof would cause the capital of the bank to be reduced below applicable capital requirements 
these restrictions indirectly affect the company s ability to pay dividends 
the primary sources of liquidity for the bank consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  borrowed funds  maturing investment securities and sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
management believes that these sources are sufficient to fund the bank s lending and investment activities 
management is responsible for establishing and monitoring liquidity targets as well as strategies and tactics to meet these targets

all fdic insured institutions must meet specified minimal capital requirements 
these regulations require banks to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio 
at december   the bank s tier i leverage ratio stood at 
in addition  the fdic has adopted capital guidelines based upon ratios of a bank s capital to total assets adjusted for risk 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
these regulations require banks to maintain minimum capital levels for capital adequacy purposes and higher capital levels to be considered well capitalized 
according to these standards  the bank had a tier i risk weighted capital ratio of and a total risk weighted capital ratio of at december  the frb has also issued capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines require the company to maintain minimum capital levels for capital adequacy purposes 
in general  the frb has adopted substantially identical capital adequacy guidelines as the fdic 
such standards are applicable to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
at december   the company s tier i leverage ratio was  its tier i risk based capital ratio was and its total risk based capital ratio was 
as of december   the company and the bank met all applicable minimum capital requirements and were considered well capitalized by both the frb and the fdic 
the decision by the sec to require the deconsolidation of special purpose entities under fasb interpretation r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised  has led the frb to further limit the inclusion of trust preferred securities in future tier i capital calculations 
to date  the company has issued a total of million of trust preferred securities and utilized their proceeds as tier i capital to help support the company s growth 
if trust preferred securities are not available as a source of future tier i capital  the company expects to use other forms of capital eg  common or preferred equity to support its growth  which  because of less favorable tax treatment  may be a somewhat more expensive source of capital than trust preferred securities 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued staff position fsp statement of position sop  terms of loan products that may give rise to a concentration of credit risk 
the fsp addresses the circumstances under which the terms of loan products give rise to a concentration of credit risk and related disclosures and accounting considerations 
the fsp is intended to emphasize the requirement to assess the adequacy of disclosures for all lending products and the effect of changes in market or economic conditions on the adequacy of those disclosures 
fsp sop is effective for all periods after december  the adoption of this fsp on december  did not materially impact the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which superseded emerging issues task force issue eitf and related amendments to eitf the guidance in fsp outlines a three step model for identifying investment impairments regarding impairment measurement  other than temporary impairment evaluation and recognition of other than temporary impairment losses and subsequent accounting 
the fsp also carries forward the disclosure requirements of eitf fsp is effective for periods beginning after december  the company does not anticipate fsp will materially impact its financial statements upon adoption on january  in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
this statement replaces accounting principles board opinion apb  accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not anticipate sfas will materially impact its financial statements upon adoption on january  in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which was subsequently revised in april by delaying the implementation date 
sfas r addresses the accounting for share based payments to employees and non employees  including grants of employee stock options 
under the new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company adopted sfas r on january  the calculation of compensation cost for share based payment transactions after the effective date of sfas r may differ from the calculation of compensation cost presented in the footnotes to the financial statements  but management has not yet quantified such differences 
the company expects that the adoption of sfas r will not have a material impact on its overall financial position 
however  the company will be required to recognize expense on new stock options granted  which may have a material impact on the company s statement of operations 
the company had fully vested all previously granted options as of december  in december  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
sop requires loans acquired through a transfer  such as a business combination  where there are differences in expected cash flows and contractual cash flows due in part to credit quality be recognized at their fair value 
the yield that may be accreted is limited to the excess of the investor s estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows over the investor s initial investment in the loan 
the excess of contractual cash flows over expected cash flows is not to be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual or valuation allowance 
valuation allowances cannot be created nor carried over in the initial accounting for loans acquired in a transfer of loans with evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination 
however  valuation allowances for non impaired loans acquired in a business combination can be carried over 
this sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sop did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised 
fin r revises fin  consolidation of variable interest entities which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements 
fin r provides guidance regarding the consolidation of special purpose entities  and removed uncertainty over whether fin required consolidation or deconsolidation of special purpose entities that issue trust preferred securities 
fin r clarified that even those entities that issue trust preferred securities with call options must be deconsolidated 
fin r is effective for financial statements for periods ending after december   with no requirement for restatement of previous periods 
the company adopted fin r on december   and therefore has deconsolidated its statutory trust subsidiaries as of that date 
adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management the principal objective of the company s asset and liability management process is to maximize profit potential while minimizing the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates by means of managing the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturity or repricing periods 
the asset and liability management process is dependent on numerous assumptions  many of which require significant judgments by the company 
the company s actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the bank s asset liability committee alco that is comprised of members of senior management 
the alco generally meets monthly and is actively involved in formulating the economic assumptions that the company uses in its financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor the sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the company has not engaged in any derivative transactions in connection with hedging activities 
the alco manages the company s interest rate risk position using both income simulation and interest rate sensitivity gap analysis 
simulation is used as the primary tool for measuring the interest rate risk inherent in the company s balance sheet at a given point in time by showing the effect on net interest income  over a month period  of interest rate ramps of up to basis points 
these simulations take into account repricing  maturity and prepayment characteristics of individual products 
the alco reviews simulation results to determine whether the downside exposure resulting from changes in market interest rates remains within established tolerance levels over both a month and month horizon  and develops appropriate strategies to manage this exposure 
the company s guidelines for interest rate risk specify that if interest rates were to shift up or down basis points over a month period  estimated net interest income for those months and the subsequent months  should decline by no more than or  respectively 
as of december   net interest income simulation indicated that the company s exposure to changing interest rates was within these tolerances 
the alco reviews the methodology utilized for calculating interest rate risk exposure and will adopt changes based upon changing market conditions or industry standards 
the following table presents the estimated impact of interest rate ramps on estimated net interest income over a month period beginning january  estimated impact on net interest income dollar percent change change dollars in thousands initial twelve month period up basis point ramp down basis point ramp subsequent twelve month period up basis point ramp down basis point ramp the company also uses interest rate sensitivity gap analysis to provide a more general overview of its interest rate risk profile 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
at december   the company s cumulative one year gap was a negative million  or of total assets  compared to positive million  or of total assets at the end of the following table presents the repricing schedule for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  to the extent applicable  amounts of assets and liabilities that mature or reprice within a particular period were determined in accordance with their contractual terms 
investment securities are allocated based upon expected call dates 
loans and mbss have been allocated based upon expected amortization and prepayment rates based on historical performance and market expectations 
savings  now and money market deposit accounts  which have no contractual term and are subject to immediate repricing  are anticipated to behave more like core accounts and therefore are presented as spread evenly over the first three years 
nonetheless  this presentation does not reflect lags that may occur in the actual repricing of these deposits 
within over over six over one three three to to twelve year to over months six months months five years five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets overnight investments investment securities mortgage backed securities fhlb stock commercial loans and leases residential mortgage loans consumer and other loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now accounts money market accounts savings accounts certificate of deposit accounts overnight short term borrowings fhlb and other borrowings subordinated deferrable interest debentures total interest bearing liabilities net interest sensitivity gap during the period cumulative gap cumulative gap interest sensitive assets as a percent of interest sensitive liabilities cumulative cumulative gap as a percent of total assets the preceding table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income because the repricing of various assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other factors 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may  in fact  reprice at different times and at different rate levels
