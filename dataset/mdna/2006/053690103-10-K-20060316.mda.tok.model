item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
avigen s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein and in item a risk factors 
overview avigen is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small molecule therapeutics and biologics to treat serious neurological and neuromuscular disorders 
our current lead product candidates primarily address neuromuscular spasm and spasticity and neuropathic pain 
our goal is to retain rights to commercialize our products in north america and therefore we expect  when appropriate  to build a sales and marketing infrastructure 
we expect that we will seek to out license rights to develop and market our products outside the united states 
we will also continue to look for opportunities to expand our pipeline of compounds through a combination of internal research  acquisitions  and in licensing as appropriate 
in building our pipeline  we focus on selecting compounds we believe have the potential to strongly differentiate themselves from existing therapies and address needs currently unmet by  or with an improved risk benefit profile when compared to  alternative available treatments 
in particular  we believe our drug candidates have unique mechanisms of action in the indications being pursued and have the potential to minimize side effects  such as sedation  that can interfere markedly with resumption of normal activity 
moreover  our two leading programs are commercially approved pharmaceuticals outside the united states 
we believe this significant human experience in markets outside the us will help accelerate our clinical development and approval for these products in north america 
in january  we acquired exclusive license rights to develop and commercialize proprietary formulations of the compound tolperisone av for the north american market 
these rights include relevant patent filings  as well as clinical data held by sanochemia relating to av sanochemia has also agreed to supply av to us exclusively for the north american market 
under the terms of the agreement  we made an upfront payment of million and will make additional payments to sanochemia  our european collaborator  based on the parties achievement of clinical and regulatory product development milestones and sales of av prior to  we focused exclusively on building a product development portfolio of dna based drug delivery technologies based primarily on aav vectors we developed 
our efforts included significant investment in early stage research in the field of gene therapy  which led to our filing of three separate inds and our initiation of three corresponding phase i or phase i ii clinical trials 
in  we began to pursue the development of non gene therapy products to diversify our portfolio  which is now our focus 
in december  we entered into an agreement with genzyme corporation  which is intended to provide independent funding for the ongoing development of our gene therapy technologies 
under the terms of the agreement  we assigned to genzyme our rights to certain aav related intellectual property  our gene therapy clinical trial programs for parkinson s disease and hemophilia  aav related contracts  and the use of previously manufactured clinical grade vector materials 
however  if genzyme fails to diligently pursue the commercialization or marketing of products using the assigned technology  as specified in the agreement  certain of the rights we assigned could revert back to avigen at a future date 
under the terms of the agreement  we received a million initial payment and could receive significant future milestone  sublicensing fees and royalty payments based on the successful development of products by genzyme utilizing technologies previously developed by us 
from through  we were party to a collaboration agreement with bayer corporation to develop a gene therapy product for hemophilia 
in  bayer paid us million to support our development of the product candidate 
that payment was originally recorded as deferred revenue and was scheduled to be recognized ratably as revenue over the estimated five year development period associated with the product 
in may  we suspended the related clinical trial and other development activities  and accelerated the recognition of the remaining portion of deferred revenue 
we have terminated the collaboration agreement with bayer and do not expect to receive any additional payments associated with similar gene therapy activities 
we are a development stage company and have primarily supported the financial needs of our research and development activities since our inception through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
we have not received any revenue from the sale of our products in development  and we do not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect that we will need to obtain additional funding to support the anticipated future needs of our research and development activities  including the costs to complete clinical trials 
we expect our source of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of payments under the genzyme agreement  collaborative arrangements with third parties  government grants  and non gene therapy related license fees 
we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years due to lack of any substantial revenue and the continuation of our ongoing and planned research and development efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture  or market our product candidates or ever achieve or sustain product revenue for profitability 
at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million and cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and restricted investments of approximately million 
we believe that our capital resources at december   after considering our anticipated spending focus on our small molecule compound based programs and away from gene therapy related activities  will be adequate to fund our operating needs for approximately the next three years 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition  valuation of investments in financial instruments  impairment of property and equipment  and recognition of research and development expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described under note in the notes to our financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the four basic criteria for revenue recognition as described in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize non refundable license or assignment fees  including development milestone payments associated with license or assignment agreements  for which we have no further significant performance obligations and no continuing involvement requirements related to product development  on the earlier of the dates on when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
for example  in connection with the million payment received under the terms of the genzyme agreement  we concluded that as of december   we did not have any significant performance obligations under the agreement that would defer the completion of the earnings process  and so recognized the entire million payment received as revenue at that time 
we recognize revenue associated with up front license  technology access and research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreements  generally the development phase 
this development phase can be defined as a specified period of time  however  in certain cases  the collaborative agreement specifies a development phase that culminates with milestone objectives but does not have a fixed date and requires us to estimate the time period over which to recognize this revenue 
our estimated time periods are based on management s estimate of the time required to achieve a particular development milestone considering the projected level of effort and current stage of development 
if our estimate of the development phase time period changes  the amount of revenue we recognize related to up front payments for a given period will accelerate or decrease accordingly 
for example  in march  we received a million payment from bayer under the terms of a collaboration agreement for coagulin b  a gene therapy product candidate for hemophilia 
the revenue associated with the payment was being recognized ratably over the development phase  which was initially estimated to be five years 
in may  we suspended subject enrollment in the phase i clinical trial for this product candidate and  as a result  ended the development phase for this product candidate and recognized as revenue million  constituting the portion of the million payment not previously recognized as revenue  during the quarter ended june  valuation of investments in financial instruments we carry investments in financial instruments at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio does not include equity securities or derivative financial instruments that could subject us to material market risk  however  we do invest in corporate obligations that subject us to varying levels of credit risk 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if a decline in fair value of a financial instrument is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the market value of the security has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intention and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  which could be until maturity 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
we have not had any write downs for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our financial instruments since our inception 
in addition  when management commits to holding individual securities until maturity in order to avoid the recognition of an other than temporary impairment  those securities would no longer be classified as available for sale 
in addition  such securities would be further evaluated to determine whether the security  based on the remaining duration until its scheduled maturity  should be identified as a current or long term asset 
as of december   management had not designated any individual securities as held to maturity for the purposes of avoiding an other than temporary impairment 
impairment of property and equipment we have invested significant amounts on construction for improvements to leased facilities we use for our research and development activities  with the largest portion of our spending made to modify manufacturing facilities that are intended to comply with requirements of government mandated manufacturing rules for pharmaceutical production 
management assesses whether the carrying value of long lived assets is impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the total of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying value or appraised value  as appropriate 
if the value of our long lived assets is judged to be impaired  the cost basis of the property and equipment is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in net loss from operations 
in determining whether the value of our property and equipment is impaired  management considers failure of manufacturing facilities and equipment to comply with government mandated policies and procedures  failure of the product candidates for which the manufacturing facilities have been constructed to receive regulatory approval  and the extent that facilities could be idled or abandoned due to a decrease in the scope of our research and development activities for an other than temporary period  resulting in excess capacity 
the determination of whether the value of our property and equipment is impaired requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
during  we determined that the scope of our research and development activities had changed such that we would not effectively utilize certain portions of our leased facilities that had been designed to support our gene therapy programs 
after considering alternative uses for these spaces  we decided it was not cost effective to re engineer the rooms representing approximately  square feet of manufacturing  laboratory  and office space under lease through may and approximately  square feet of similar space we have under lease through november we believe we would maximize our potential cost savings by subleasing the properties 
based on market conditions for rental property at the time of the reduction in the scope of our research and development activities  and our subsequent completion of sublease agreements for approximately  square feet  we do not expect to fully recover the value invested in leasehold improvements and equipment  and have reduced our net carrying value for these assets to their current fair value  resulting in an impairment loss for the year ended december  of approximately million 
this amount does not impact our cash flows and primarily represents an acceleration of depreciation charges that would have been recognized over the remaining three and five year lease periods 
recognition of research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including related salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead costs  clinical trial and related drug product costs  contract services and other outside service expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operating expense in the period incurred and consist of costs incurred for our independent  as well as our collaborative  research and development activities 
pursuant to management s assessment of the services that have been performed on clinical trials and other contracts  we recognize expenses as the services are provided 
several of our contracts extend across multiple reporting periods 
management assessments include  but are not limited to an evaluation by the project manager of the work that has been completed during the period  measurement of progress prepared internally  estimates of incurred costs by the third party service providers  and management s judgment 
the determination of the percentage of work completed that determines the amount of research and development expense that should be recognized in a given period requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
these estimated expenses may or may not match the actual fees billed by the service providers as determined by actual work completed 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future reporting periods 
results of operations revenue year ended december  in thousands  except percentages revenue percentage increase over prior period revenue in primarily reflected the million payment received in connection with our agreement with genzyme corporation 
revenue in primarily included the acceleration of deferred revenue associated with the termination of our gene therapy collaboration with bayer corporation for hemophilia 
we had received a million payment from bayer in march in connection with our collaboration on a gene therapy product for hemophilia 
the payment was being recognized ratably over the estimated development period of the product candidate  which was estimated at five years 
in may  we suspended patient enrollment in the trial  which resulted in the termination of the development of the product candidate and accelerated the recognition of all remaining deferred revenue 
research license fees associated with our gene therapy technologies totaled   and  during   and  respectively 
these research license agreements allowed licensees to make or use products using our patented aav technologies for research purposes only  and did not allow for the use of these technologies in products for commercial sale 
royalty revenue totaled   and  during   and  respectively  and was attributed to a single royalty license that was entered into in july  which allowed for the development  manufacture  use and commercial sale of research products using our patented aav technologies 
as a result of the assignment of our gene therapy assets to genzyme  and termination of the collaboration agreement with bayer in  we are no longer a direct party to most of the license or collaboration agreements that gave rise to the revenues we recognized over the last three years 
as a result  we do not expect any significant revenues for the foreseeable future and that such revenues  if any  will consist solely of payments that may be received in connection with the genzyme agreement and other non gene therapy related activities 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses can be divided into two primary functions  costs to support research and preclinical development and costs to support preparation for and implementation of human clinical trials 
research and preclinical development costs include activities associated with general research and exploration  animal studies  production of drug substances for use by external collaborators in general research and exploration  development of processes to translate research achievements into commercial scale capabilities  and in house and independent third party validation testing of potential acquisition or in license drug candidates 
clinical development costs include activities associated with preparing for regulatory approvals  maintaining regulated and controlled processes  manufacturing drug substances for use in human clinical trials  and supporting subject enrollment and subject administration within clinical trials 
during the first half of  our research and development activities were primarily focused on our aav based programs for hemophilia and parkinson s disease and our non aav programs for neuropathic pain 
our staff count dedicated to research and development activities at the time averaged approximately employees 
in july  in connection with the suspension of a gene therapy related clinical trial for hemophilia  we began to shift the focus of our resources toward neurological programs  and reduced our workforce by approximately percent 
this reduced the number of employees dedicated to our research and development activities to approximately at december  in august  we took additional steps to reduce our involvement with and spending on aav based activities and reduced our workforce by approximately positions  or percent 
as a result  at december   the staff count associated with our current research and development activities  which focus on our portfolio of small molecule candidates for the treatment of serious neurological and neuromuscular disorders  was approximately the costs associated with these two primary functions of our research and development activities approximate the following year ended december  in thousands  except percentages percentage decrease over year ended december  percentage decrease over research and preclinical development clinical development total research and development expenses because a significant percentage of our research and development resources are dedicated to activities that focus on broad methods and mechanisms that may be used in multiple product applications  including production and administration techniques  the majority of our costs are not directly attributed to individual development programs 
decisions regarding our project management and resource allocation are primarily based on interpretations of scientific data  rather than cost allocations 
our estimates of costs between research and preclinical development and clinical development are primarily based on staffing roles within our research and development departments 
as such  costs allocated to specific projects may not necessarily reflect the actual costs of those efforts and  therefore  we do not generally evaluate actual costs incurred information on a project by project basis 
in addition  we are unable to estimate the future costs to completion for any specific projects 
research and preclinical development year ended december  in thousands personnel related external research and development other expenses including facilities overhead and depreciation total research and preclinical development expenses comparison of years ended december  and the decreases in our total research and preclinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of million  were primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower personnel related expenses of million  reflecting the impact of a significantly lower average staff level as a result of staff reductions in july and august  partially offset by higher average salaries and higher severance expense in  lower expenditures for external research and development services from third party collaborators associated with our preclinical animal studies of million  primarily related to our completion of significant preclinical work with parkinson s disease in as it transitioned into a clinical development phase  and lower other expenses of  primarily reflecting a decrease in depreciation charges as a result of the write down of the cost basis of our long lived assets during the year due to impairment 
comparison of years ended december  and the decreases in our total research and preclinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of  were primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower expenditures for external research and development services from third party collaborators associated with our preclinical animal studies of  primarily related to our completion of a significant portion of our preclinical work with parkinson s disease in and a reduction in preclinical work associated with other gene therapy projects  primarily due to our lower staff levels in  lower personnel related expenses of  primarily reflecting a lower average staff count as a result of the staff reduction in july and lower recruiting and relocation expenses reflecting a decline in hiring and the use of relocation payment incentives in compared to  partially offset by higher severance expenses paid to employees affected by the staff reduction in and higher bonus expenses in  and lower other expenses of  primarily reflecting lower materials expenses due to a decrease in our consumption of materials to produce aav vectors and support our other on going research activities as a result of the transfer of our parkinson s program into a clinical development phase  and the general impact of our lower staff levels in clinical development year ended december  in thousands personnel related external research and development other expenses including facilities overhead and depreciation total clinical development expenses comparison of years ended december  and the decreases in our total clinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of million  were primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower personnel related expenses of  reflecting a significantly lower average staff level as a result of staff reductions in july and august and lower severance related costs  partially offset by higher average salaries in  and lower other expenses of million  primarily due to a decrease in depreciation charges as a result of the write down of the cost basis of our long lived assets during the year due to impairment  a decrease in the amounts of materials consumed in compared to the prior year in connection with the production of clinical grade aav vectors to support the needs of our clinical trials  and a decrease in other costs associated with our transition out of gene therapy related activities 
comparison of years ended december  and the decreases in our total clinical development expenses for the year ended december   compared to  of million  were primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower other expenses of million  primarily reflecting lower license origination fees  including  of non cash charges in connection with the issuance of warrants in  and lower materials expenses reflecting lower levels of material consumed in for the production of clinical grade aav vectors due to the delayed needs of our development programs at the clinical development stage  and lower personnel related expenses of  reflecting a lower average staff level  partially offset by higher severance expenses paid to employees affected by the staff reduction in  partially offset by  higher expenditures for external clinical development services from third party collaborators associated with recruiting and treating subjects in our clinical trials of  primarily related to regulatory costs associated with the filing for fda approval and recruiting of our first subject in our phase i ii clinical trial for av  our gene therapy based product candidate for the treatment of parkinson s disease 
total research and development expenses for were within management s expectations  taking into account the scheduled pace of subject recruitment in our gene therapy based parkinson s disease clinical trial and the lengthy time periods common to negotiations with external parties 
we believe delays in regulatory approvals and scheduling of participants will continue to be factors that could limit the pace of progress in future clinical trials for our portfolio of small molecule product candidates  albeit to a lesser degree than we experienced with gene therapy clinical trials 
as a result  we have taken steps to reduce our overhead and operating costs in order to extend the life of our financial resources 
if we are successful in our efforts to develop our product candidates  including the initiation of clinical trials  or acquire or in license additional product candidates for development  our total research and development spending in will be likely to remain the same or rise in order to meet the development needs of such product candidates 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands  except percentages personnel related legal and professional fees non recurring severance other expenses including facilities overhead and depreciation total general and administrative expenses percentage decrease increase over prior period comparison of the years ended december  and the decrease of  in our general and administrative expenses in  compared to  was primarily due to changes in costs for the following lower severance expenses of million  primarily related to severance expense accrued in march in connection with the resignation of our former ceo  and lower other expenses of  including savings from lower corporate insurance premiums  partially offset by  higher legal and professional fees of  primarily related to an increase in costs associated with being a public company and increased use of third party business consultants  and higher personnel related expenses of  reflecting higher average salaries and bonuses  partially offset by a slightly lower staff level in comparison of the years ended december  and the increase of  in our general and administrative expenses in  compared to  was primarily due to severance expense of million  approximately  of which was accrued in connection with the resignation of our former ceo in march we expect our general and administrative expenses for to decrease below our levels  primarily due to lower average staff and overhead costs 
however  if we are successful in the clinical development of our products  including increasing awareness of the market potential for our drug candidates  or expand our portfolio of development candidates through additional strategic relationships and collaborations  our expected general and administrative spending levels may increase in connection with the changing needs of the company 
impairment loss related to long lived assets year ended december  in thousands impairment loss related to long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the total of estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount or appraised value  as appropriate 
during  we recorded impairment charges of million related to leasehold improvements and equipment associated with approximately  square feet of manufacturing  laboratory  and office space under lease through may and approximately  square feet of similar space we have under lease through november these charges were based on our assessments of changes in the scope of our research and development activities at june and september   and the determination that it was not cost effective to re engineer facilities that had been designed to support our aav based gene therapy programs 
based on these assessments  we have consolidated our operations and entered into sublease agreements for portions of these facilities 
under rental market conditions at the time of each assessment  we determined we would not receive incremental rents above the cost of our underlying lease obligations 
therefore  we adjusted the cost basis of the long lived assets associated with these facilities to zero  to reflect their estimated fair value 
these charges do not impact our cash flow and represent an acceleration of depreciation expenses that were scheduled to be recognized over the next three to five years 
as a result of the recognition of these charges  future depreciation expenses for these long lived assets will decrease 
interest income year ended december  in thousands  except percentages interest income percentage decrease over prior period almost all of our interest income is generated from our investments in high grade marketable securities of government and corporate debt 
the decline in interest income between and was primarily due to the decrease in our outstanding interest bearing cash and securities balances  due to the use of such resources to fund our on going operations during the year  partially offset by a rising average yield earned on our portfolio of investments 
the decline in interest income between and was due to the decrease in our outstanding interest bearing cash and securities balance combined with a declining average yield earned on our portfolio of investments during the period 
recently issued accounting standards see note  summary of significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect  if any  on avigen  which discussion is incorporated by reference here 
deferred income tax assets in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes  which is described in the notes to our financial statements  we have calculated a deferred tax asset based on the potential future tax benefit we may be able to realize in future periods as a result of the significant tax losses experienced since our inception 
however  the value of such deferred tax asset must be calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which such income occurs 
since we have no history of earnings  and cannot reliably predict when we might create taxable income  if at all  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our calculated deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  cash expenditures have significantly exceeded our revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
after our initial public offering in may  we raised million from private placements and public offerings of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock 
after our initial public offering  we also received additional funds as a result of exercises of previously issued warrants and options to purchase our common stock  including an additional million during the three year period ended december  the timing of and amounts realized from the exercise of these warrants and options are determined by the decisions of the respective warrant and option holders  and are not controlled by us 
therefore  funds received from exercises of stock options and warrants in past periods should not be considered an indication of additional funds to be received in the future periods 
in addition  a significant percentage of options and warrants currently outstanding have exercise prices that exceed the current trading price of our common stock  and so unless the trading price of our common stock increases significantly  those options and warrants may never be exercised 
in addition to funding our operations through sales of our common stock  in march  we received million in research support from bayer corporation in connection with our collaboration on a gene therapy product for hemophilia 
in december  we received a million payment from genzyme corporation in connection with the agreement transferring to genzyme rights to most of our aav based intellectual property  our gene therapy clinical trial programs for parkinson s disease and hemophilia  and clinical grade vector materials 
we also have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting facilities  contracting with third parties to conduct research and development and using consultants  where appropriate 
we expect to incur additional future expenses  resulting in significant additional cash expenditures  as we continue our research and development activities  including our efforts to develop  manufacture  and commercialize our current drug candidates  expand our product portfolio with additional development candidates through internal research  acquisition or in licensing  and undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates 
we also expect to incur substantial additional expenses relating to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities  and restricted investments  of approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  and million at december  at december   and  million  million  and million  respectively  of restricted investments were pledged to secure certain long term liabilities 
the reduction of million in restricted investments at december   was directly associated with the reduction in our pledge to collateralize certain equipment operating leases 
at december  and  the portion of our investment portfolio pledged as collateral  which we refer to as restricted investments  includes million for our line of credit and approximately  for letters of credit which serve as security deposits on a building lease 
our restricted investments would not be considered a current source of additional liquidity 
operating activities 
net cash used for operating activities was million for compared to million for the decrease in cash used for operating activities is primarily due to the receipt of million in in connection with our transaction with genzyme  and million in lower research and development expenses as described previously 
net cash used for operating activities in was million compared to million for the increase in the amount of cash used in compared to is primarily due to the million payment received from bayer in in connection with our collaboration agreement 
the cash used in operating activities for these years was primarily used to support our internal research and development activities  as well as preclinical studies and clinical trials performed by third parties  and our evaluation of potential in license product opportunities 
the level of cash used in operating activities in was in line with management s expectations 
the level of cash used for operating activities during was slightly lower than management s expectations due to the general delays in the progress of our clinical trials 
investing and financing activities 
net cash provided by investing and financing activities in was million and  respectively  compared to million and  respectively  for the same activities in the cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of sales and maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities and the reduction in restricted investments  offset to a small degree by purchases of property and equipment of  in and  in during  cash provided by investing activities also included  proceeds from our sale of laboratory and office equipment and furniture in connection with our consolidation of facilities previously used for our gene therapy activities 
the cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the period 
net cash provided by investing and financing activities in was million and  respectively 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of sales and maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities  offset to a small degree by purchases of property and equipment of  and an increase in restricted investments of  the cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the period 
during  in connection with our decision to discontinue funding of our gene therapy programs  we took steps to reduce expenses by reducing our staff level and consolidating our operations in order to reduce overhead and sublease portions of our facilities 
at december   we had reduced our full time employee staff level to from at the end of the previous year  and completed sublease agreements for approximately  square feet of our leased facilities  or percent 
we believe that the future annual savings in personnel costs  including salaries  benefits  and temporary staffing  related to the impact of the august staff reduction will approximate million per year  and that the sum of scheduled sublease income and related reimbursement of a portion of our facilities overhead costs from our subtenants will approximate million over the remaining lease terms 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations net of sublease income  and contractual commitments to fund third party research in thousands payments due by period contractual commitment total less than year years years operating leases sublease income net operating leases revolving line of credit research funding for third parties total in june  we amended the terms of our million revolving line of credit which had been put in place with wells fargo bank in june  to provide support for construction related activities  and was subsequently amended in june under the terms of the current amendment  the expiration date of the borrowing was extended from june  to june   thereby deferring the timetable to repay principal borrowed for two years 
the debt instrument bears interest at a floating rate based on the london inter bank offered rate  which is reset in three month increments after the date of each drawdown  until such expiration 
as of december  and  the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately and  respectively 
also under the terms of this agreement  we pledged a portion of our portfolio of available for sale securities as collateral and have identified the amount of the pledged securities as restricted investments on our balance sheets 
the amount of the pledged securities is equal to the amount of utilized borrowing capacity on the line of credit 
at december   we had borrowed million from the line of credit and had reserved the remaining million in borrowing capacity to secure a letter of credit in connection with the property lease entered into in november as a result  at december   we have no more borrowing capacity under this facility 
our current office and facility includes approximately  square feet of space 
of this  approximately  square feet of space is leased through may and approximately  square feet of space is leased through november we have completed sublease agreements for approximately  square feet of these leased facilities 
payments scheduled under these lease commitments and sublease agreements are included in the table above under operating leases and sublease income 
we enter into commitments to fund collaborative research and clinical work performed by third parties 
while these contracts are cancelable by either party  we expect the research studies and clinical work to be completed as defined in the terms of the agreements  and all amounts paid when due 
payments scheduled to be made under these contracts are included in the table above under research funding for third parties 
we believe we will continue to require substantial additional funding in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our proposed products 
we believe that with the reductions in our staff over the past two years  our efforts to reduce other legacy gene therapy related spending  the receipt of million from genzyme in connection with the assignment of rights to our gene therapy interests  and the consolidation of our operations and sublease of portions of our facilities  our financial resources at december  will be adequate to fund our projected operating needs for approximately three years 
however  this forward looking statement is based upon our current plans and assumptions regarding our future operating and capital requirements  which may change 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patents claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs involved in obtaining licenses to patented technologies from third parties that may be needed to commercialize our product candidates  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and sales  the costs of marketing and commercialization activities  how successful  if at all  we are at acquiring or in licensing additional compounds  and the nature of the consideration we pay for acquired or in licensed compounds  and other factors which may not be within our control 
we intend to continue to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing  when market conditions allow  or through additional collaborative arrangements with corporate partners 
we may consider issuing equity securities under our october shelf registration statement 
the balance of securities available for sale under the existing shelf registration agreement is approximately million 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  there may be further dilution to existing stockholders 
we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to enter into such financing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
without such additional funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs

our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
by policy  we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality issuers and highly liquid instruments with effective maturities of less than five years  and an average aggregate portfolio duration of approximately one to three years 
our entire portfolio is classified as available for sale and  as of december   consisted of fixed rate securities 
this compares to approximately fixed rate securities and variable rate securities at december  we have evaluated the risk associated with our portfolios of investments in marketable securities and have deemed this market risk to be immaterial 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from their december  levels  we estimate that the fair value of our securities portfolio would decline by approximately  our estimated exposure at december  is lower than our estimated  exposure at december  due to the reduction in size of our overall portfolio 
the modeling technique used measures duration risk sensitivity to estimate the potential change in fair value arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market rates and quantifies the ending fair market value including principal and accrued interest 
our long term debt includes a million revolving line of credit due june   of which we have drawn down million in cash that will need to be repaid 
interest charged on the borrowing is based on libor and is reset in three month increments based on the date of each original drawdown 
as of december   the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately compared to as of december
