item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals  polymers and fabricated products 
our two principal business segments are olefins and vinyls 
we use the majority of our internally produced basic chemicals to produce higher value added chemicals and fabricated products 
consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly over the past years 
our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value added chemical products used in many end markets 
petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies 
the petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics  and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates  the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials 
the cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply  leading to high operating rates and margins  followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of significant capacity additions 
due to the significant size of new plants  capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed 
we believe that the industry has emerged from a down cycle and is currently enjoying strong demand and global economic growth in spite of high energy and raw material costs 
currently  no significant new olefins or vinyls capacity additions are expected in north america until the end of operating rates and margins began to improve during  and increased as economic growth improved and excess capacity was absorbed 
these factors resulted in increased margins in  and we purchase significant amounts of ethane and propane feedstock  natural gas  chlorine and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains 
we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes 
while we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane and propane feedstocks  natural gas  chlorine  salt and electricity  the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
factors which have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future  include shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand  capacity constraints due to construction delays  strike action or involuntary shutdowns  the general level of business and economic activity  and the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation 
significant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins  as sales price increases generally tend to lag behind raw material cost increases 
conversely  when raw material costs decrease  customers seek relief in the form of lower sales prices 
these dynamics are particularly pronounced during periods of excess industry capacity and contributed to the trough conditions experienced by the chemical industry and us in and we typically do not enter into significant hedging arrangements with respect to prices of raw materials 
in and  we experienced two periods of dramatically increased raw material costs 
in  natural gas prices spiked to a high of per million btus  or mmbtu  as compared to a three year average of per mmbtu between and prices for natural gas declined  but spiked again in to a high of per mmbtu 
as a result of weak industry conditions  in most cases we were unable to fully pass these raw material price increases through to customers and our margins declined 
in  we experienced another natural gas price spike with prices averaging per mmbtu 
in this period  we were able to pass higher feedstock prices through to our customers 
as a result  margins improved compared to margins in and during  natural gas prices continued to increase  with prices averaging per mmbtu 
in this period  we were able to pass higher feedstock prices through to our customers and the margins for many of our products 
table of contents improved 
during  natural gas prices continued to increase  with prices averaging per mmbtu 
in this period  we were again able to pass higher feedstock prices through to our customers and the margins for most of our products improved 
our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity  our efficient use of the capacity and our ability to increase our capacity 
since our inception  we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions  new plant construction and internal expansion 
we evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of its cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs 
we are planning major turnarounds at one of our ethylene units in lake charles and at our ethylene plant in calvert city during the turnaround in lake charles is expected to last approximately days  the one in calvert city  approximately days 
both turnarounds are planned for the second quarter of  but the actual timing of each one could differ depending on interim developments 
during a turnaround  production at the unit is suspended while work on the unit is performed

table of contents compared with net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to price increases throughout our olefins and vinyls segments and higher sales volumes in vcm  pvc resin and pvc pipe 
higher selling prices largely resulted from stronger demand for our products and higher raw material costs that were generally passed through to customers 
pvc pipe sales in were higher than in due to the august acquisition of the assets of bristolpipe corporation 
gross margin 
gross margins increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to higher selling prices throughout our olefins and vinyls segments and higher sales volumes for vcm  pvc resin and pvc pipe resulting from increased demand 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes for ethylene  polyethylene and styrene  higher raw material costs for ethane  propane and benzene and higher energy costs 
our raw materials costs in both segments normally track industry prices  which experienced  according to cmai  an increase of for ethane  for propane and for benzene in as compared to a fire at our calvert city ethylene plant also negatively impacted our gross margin

net proceeds from the ipo of million and cash generated from operating activities were used to repay million of debt and affiliate borrowings in see liquidity and capital resources below 
in  we incurred million in costs associated with the refinancing that were capitalized and that will be amortized over the term of the new debt 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our long term financing 
cash cash balances were million at december  compared to million at december  we believe the december  cash levels are adequate to fund our short term cash requirements 
debt our present debt structure is used to fund our business operations  and our revolving credit facility is a source of liquidity 
on january   we amended our senior secured revolving credit facility to  among other things  increase the commitment from million to million and generally reduce the interest payable 
after the amendment as of january   the revolving credit facility bore interest at either libor plus or prime rate minus  and a unused line fee  all of which are subject to quarterly grid pricing adjustments based on a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maturity of the facility was extended to january  on january   we issued million of new unsecured senior notes due  the proceeds of which  together with cash on hand  were used to redeem our senior notes due and repay our term loan as follows on january   we repaid the entire million outstanding under our term loan  plus accrued but unpaid interest 

table of contents on two redemption dates  february  and february   we redeemed the entire million principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due  and paid a make whole premium of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
as a result of the early redemption of the senior notes due  we expect to recognize million in non operating expense in the first quarter of consisting of a pre payment premium on the senior notes of million and a write off of million in previously capitalized debt issuance cost 
the senior notes are unsecured 
there is no sinking fund and no scheduled amortization of the notes prior to maturity 
the notes are subject to redemption and holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change of control 
all domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of ours or of another guarantor of the senior notes in excess of million are guarantors of the notes 
the agreements governing the senior notes and the revolving credit facility each contain customary covenants and events of default 
accordingly  these agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions  among other things  provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends  certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets 
these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  including  without limitation  an exception for the payment of our regular quarterly dividend of up to per share 
the senior notes indenture does not allow distributions unless  after giving pro forma effect to the distribution  our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least and such payment  together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after january   is less than the sum of of our consolidated net income for the period from october  to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed  plus of net cash proceeds received after october  as a contribution to our common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities  plus several other adjustments 
the amount allowed under this restriction was million at january  the revolving credit facility also restricts dividend payments unless  after giving effect to such payment  the availability equals or exceeds million 
none of the agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios  except that the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to when availability falls below million 
in addition  the senior notes indenture and the revolving credit facility restrict our ability to create liens  to engage in certain affiliate transactions and to engage in sale leaseback transactions 
as of december   our long term debt  including current maturities  totaled million  consisting of million principal amount of senior notes due  a million senior secured term loan due in  and a million loan from the proceeds of tax exempt revenue bonds supported by a million letter of credit

as a result of the early payment on the senior notes  we recognized million in non operating expense in the third quarter of consisting of a pre payment premium on the senior notes of million and a write off of million in previously capitalized debt issuance cost 
in addition  we repaid million of our senior secured term loan on december  and incurred an additional million of non operating expense related to the write off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs 
the senior notes were unsecured 
all domestic restricted subsidiaries were guarantors of the senior notes 
in the first quarter of  these notes were repaid 
at inception  the term loan bore interest at either the eurodollar rate plus or prime rate plus 
quarterly principal payments of million were due on the term loan beginning on september   with 
table of contents the balance due in four equal quarterly installments in the seventh year of the loan 
we used the proceeds from the ipo to prepay million of the term loan in august  which prepayment was applied to and reduced the final installment of the term loan 
mandatory prepayments were due on the term loan with the proceeds of asset sales and casualty events subject  in some instances  to reinvestment provisions 
the term loan also required prepayment with of excess cash flow as determined under the term loan agreement 
the term loan was collateralized by our lake charles and calvert city facilities and some related intangible assets 
as of september   we and our lenders entered into an amendment to the term loan that reduced the applicable interest rate so that the term loan subsequently bore interest at either the eurodollar rate plus or prime rate plus 
the amendment also eliminated the requirement to use excess cash flow to repay the term loan 
we repaid million of the term loan on december  as described above  all amounts outstanding under the term loan were repaid in the first quarter of the revolving credit facility bore interest at either libor plus or prime rate plus  subject to grid pricing adjustment based on a fixed charge coverage ratio after the first year and subject to a unused line fee 
the revolving credit agreement was amended on february   june  and november  to  among other things  lower the applicable margin by of the pricing grid  modify the termination fee  extend the maturity date by one year  and revise various definitions and covenants to allow the ipo and the bristolpipe acquisition and to facilitate our operations 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by accounts receivable and contract rights  inventory  chattel paper  instruments  documents  deposit accounts and related intangible assets 
we had standby letters of credit outstanding at december  of million and million of available borrowing capacity under this facility 
in the first quarter of  we amended this facility as described above and extended the maturity to january  our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions 
we have evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes and believe those policies are reasonable and appropriate 
we apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with gaap 
our more critical accounting policies include those related to long lived assets  accruals for long term employee benefits  inventories  accounts receivable and environmental and legal obligations 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates 
we periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts 
for export contracts  the title and risk of loss passes to customers at the time specified by each contract 
provisions for discounts  rebates and returns are provided for in the same period as the related sales are recorded 
long lived assets 
key estimates related to long lived assets include useful lives  recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations and such estimates could be significantly modified 
the carrying values of long lived assets could be impaired by new technological developments  new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages  uncertainties associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions 

table of contents we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses 
actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated 
additionally  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long lived assets of our businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from three to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation charges would be accelerated 
we defer the costs of major turnaround maintenance and repair activities and amortize the costs over the period until the next expected major turnaround of the affected unit 
during  cash expenditures of million were deferred and are being amortized  generally over three to five year periods 
there were no major turnarounds in and amortization in  and of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   capitalized turnaround costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
expensing turnaround costs would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
additional information concerning long lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
long term employee benefit costs 
our costs for long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits  are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is our responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties 
it is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and  if necessary  adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors 
accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match  for each employee  that estimated cost to the period worked 
to accomplish this  we rely extensively on advice from actuaries  and assumptions are made about inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates 
assumed healthcare trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans because benefits for participants are capped at a fixed amount 
additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
inventories 
inventories primarily include product  materials and supplies 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
the use of other methods  such as lifo  could result in differing amounts being reported as inventories and cost of sales depending on price changes and sales turnover levels 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
in our determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  and consistent with our accounting policy  we estimate the amount of accounts receivable that we believe are unlikely to be collected and we record an expense of that amount 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strength of our customers  and  in our analysis  we combine the use of historical experience  our accounts receivable aged trial balance and specific collectibility analysis 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
balances over days past due and accounts determined by our analysis of financial strength of customers to be high risk are reviewed individually for collectibility 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
environmental and legal obligations 
we consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings 
we accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 
additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable 
we use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products 
based on our open derivative positions at december   a hypothetical increase in the price of an mmbtu of natural gas would have decreased our income before taxes by million 
additional information concerning derivative commodity instruments appears in the consolidated financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had variable rate debt of million outstanding 
all of the debt under our credit facility  tax exempt revenue bonds  and term loan was at variable rates 
as part of our refinancing in january  the term loan was repaid in full 
the remaining variable rate debt balance is million 
we do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt  but we may do so in the future 
the average variable interest rate for our remaining variable rate debt of million as of december  was 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
also  at december   we had million of fixed rate debt which has been paid in full and replaced with million of fixed rate debt in january we are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced 
if interest rates are higher at the time of refinancing  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million
