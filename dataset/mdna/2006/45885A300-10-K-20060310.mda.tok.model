item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
overview we market products and services that provide managed and premise based ip and route optimization technologies that enable business critical applications such as e commerce  crm  video and audio streaming  voip  vpns  and supply chain management 
our product and service offerings are complemented by ip access solutions such as data center services  cdn and managed security 
at december   we delivered services through our network access points  across north america  london  and the asia pacific region including tokyo and sydney  australia 
internap s private network access points p nap feature direct high speed connections to major internet backbones such as at t  sprint  verizon formerly mci  savvis  global crossing telecommunications and level communications 
the key characteristic that differentiates us from our competition is our portfolio of patented and patent pending route optimization solutions that address the inherent weaknesses of the internet and overcome the inefficiencies of traditional ip connectivity options 
our intelligent routing technology can facilitate traffic over multiple carriers  as opposed to just one carrier s network  to ensure highly reliable performance over the internet 
we believe our unique carrier neutral approach provides better performance  control and reliability compared to conventional internet connectivity alternatives 
our service level agreements guarantee performance across the entire internet in the united states  excluding local connections  whereas providers of conventional internet connectivity typically only guarantee performance on their own network 
internap serves customers in a variety of industries including financial services  entertainment and media  travel  e commerce  retail and technology 
as of december   we provided our services to approximately  customers in the united states and abroad  including several fortune and mid tier enterprises 
highlights and outlook due to the nature of the services we provide  we generally price our internet connectivity services at a premium to the services offered by conventional internet connectivity service providers 
we believe customers with business critical internet applications will continue to demand the highest quality of service as their internet connectivity needs grow and become even more complex and  as such  will continue to pay a premium for our high performance managed internet connectivity services 
our success in executing our premium pricing strategy depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to differentiate our connectivity solutions from lower cost alternatives 
the key measures of our success in achieving this differentiation are revenue and customer growth 
during  we added more than net new customers  bringing our total to approximately  enterprise customers as of december  revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  solidified management team is focused on achieving profitability and revenue by leveraging operating efficiencies 
in november  james p 
deblasio  a year technology veteran and former lucent executive  was appointed ceo 
through a renewed emphasis on aggressive cost containment our management team will focus on reducing net losses and driving gross profit to improve shareholder value 
we intend to increase revenue by leveraging the capabilities of our existing network access points 
in our existing markets  we realize incremental margins as new customers are added 
additional volume in an existing market allows improved utilization of existing facilities and an improved ability to cost effectively predict and acquire additional network capacity 
conversely  decreases in the number of customers in an established market lead to decreased facility utilization and increase the possibility that direct network resources are not cost efficiently employed 
these factors have a direct bearing on our financial position and results of operations 
we also intend to increase revenue by expanding our geographic coverage in key markets in the united states and abroad 
as we enter new geographic markets  operatin results will be affected by increased expense for hiring  training and managing new employees  acquiring and implementing new systems and expense for new facilities 
our ability to generate increased revenue depends on the success of our cost control measures as we expand our geographic coverage 
we believe that our data center services will continue to be drivers of revenue in during  we focused on selling  investing in and managing data center services 
in order to meet the current and future anticipated demand for our data center services  we invested more than million in to upgrade and expand our existing facilities 
of the  total square feet of data center space directly operated by internap  approximately was utilized as of december  we have  total square feet of data center space operated under agreements with third parties of which approximately was utilized as of december  during the year  we also focused on bundling our ip and data center services 
our approach to expanding data center capabilities is needs driven  as it serves to enhance our customers access to internap s core ip services 
we believe this bundling brings great value to our customers  as evidenced by the fact that approximately of our data center customers also purchase ip services 
we sell approximately two thirds of new monthly recurring revenue to new customers 
selling new monthly recurring revenue to new customers allows us to expand our customer base as well as guard against customer loss 
while we have limited our execution of traditional advertising over the past year  we are focused on increasing brand awareness through appropriate marketing vehicles 
we will continue to develop integrated marketing campaigns that identify qualified leads  generate interest and promote business benefits among key audiences 
we will also conduct public relations efforts focused on securing third party recognition of our products and services from the media and industry analysts 
our marketing organization is also responsible for creating our product strategy based upon primary and secondary market research and the advancement of new technologies 
business combinations on october   we completed our acquisition of netvmg  inc netvmg 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under sfas no 
 business combinations 
the aggregate purchase price of the acquired company  plus related charges  was million and was comprised of  shares of our series a preferred stock  acquisition costs and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock 
on october   we completed our acquisition of sockeye networks  inc sockeye 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under sfas no 
the aggregate purchase price of the acquired company  plus related charges  was million and was comprised of million shares of our common stock and acquisition costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those summarized below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenue is derived from high performance internet connectivity and related data center services 
our revenue is generated primarily from the sale of internet connectivity services at fixed rates or usage based pricing to our customers that desire a ds or faster connection and other ancillary services 
ancillary services include data center services  cdn  server management and installation services  virtual private networking services  managed security services  data backup  and remote storage and restoration services 
we also offer t and fractional ds connections at fixed rates 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been provided  the fees for the service rendered are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
contracts and sales or purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we test for availability or use shipping documents when applicable to verify delivery of our product or service 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
deferred revenue consists of revenue for services to be delivered in the future and consist primarily of advance billings  which are amortized over the respective service period 
revenue associated with billings for installation of customer network equipment are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship generally two years  as the installation service is integral to our primary service offering and does not have value to a customer on a stand alone basis 
deferred post contract customer support pcs associated with sales of our fcp solution and similar products are amortized ratably over the contract period generally one year 
customer credit risk 
we routinely review the creditworthiness of our customers 
if we determine that collection of service revenue is uncertain  we do not recognize revenue until cash has been collected 
additionally  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific and general customer information  which also includes estimates based on management s best understanding of the customers ability to pay 
customers ability to pay takes into consideration payment history  legal status ie  bankruptcy  and the status of services we are providing 
once all collection efforts have been exhausted  we write the uncollectible balance off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also estimate a reserve for sales adjustments  which reduces net accounts receivable and revenue 
the reserve for sales adjustments is based upon specific and general customer information  including outstanding promotional credits  customer disputes  credit adjustments not yet processed through the billing system and historical activity 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or management becomes aware of new information impacting a customer s credit risk  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for leases and leasehold improvements 
we record leases as capital or operating leases and account for leasehold improvements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases and related literature 
rent expense for operating leases is recorded in accordance with fasb technical bulletin financial accounting standards board ftb no 
 issues relating to accounting for leases 
this ftb requires lease agreements that include periods of free rent or other incentives  specific escalating lease payments  or both  to be recorded on a straight line or other systematic basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as deferred rent in non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
investments 
we account for investments without readily determinable fair values at historical cost  as determined by our initial investment 
the recorded value of cost basis investments is periodically reviewed to determine the propriety of the recorded basis 
when a decline in the value that is judged to be other than temporary has occurred  based on available data  the cost basis is reduced and an investment loss is recorded 
we have a million equity investment at december  in aventail corporation aventail  an early stage  privately held company  after having reduced the balance for an impairment loss of million in the carrying value of our investment in aventail is recorded in non current investments in our consolidated balance sheet 
we account for investments that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over an investee using the equity method of accounting 
significant influence  but not control  is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee of between and  although other factors  such as minority interest protections  are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
as of december   internap japan co  ltd 
internap japan  our joint venture with ntt me corporation of japan and another ntt affiliate  qualifies for equity method accounting 
we record our proportional share of the income and losses of internap japan one month in arrears on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of non current investments and as other income  net on the consolidated statement of operations 
investments in marketable securities primarily include high credit quality corporate debt securities and us government agency debt securities 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income 
goodwill 
we recorded goodwill as a result of our acquisitions of co space  vpnx 
com  netvmg  and sockeye 
we account for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step  and is compared to the carrying value for goodwill 
any shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
we selected august as our annual testing date 
to assist us in estimating the fair value for purposes of completing the first step of the sfas no 
analysis  we engaged a professional business valuation and appraisal firm who utilized discounted cash flow valuation methods and the guideline company method for reasonableness 
the forecasts of future cash flows was based on our best estimate of future revenue  operating costs and general market conditions  and was subject to review and approval by senior management 
both approaches to determining fair value depend on our stock price since market capitalization will impact the discount rate to be applied as well as a market multiple analyses 
changes in the forecast could cause us to either pass or fail the first step test and could result in the impairment of goodwill 
accruals for disputed telecommunication costs 
in delivering our services  we rely on a number of internet network  telecommunication and other vendors 
we work directly with these vendors to provision services such as establishing  modifying or discontinuing services for our customers 
because of the volume of activity  billing disputes inevitably arise 
these disputes typically stem from disagreements concerning the starting and ending dates of service  quoted rates  usage and various other factors 
for potential billing errors made in the vendor s favor  for example a duplicate billing  we initiate a formal dispute with the vendor and record the related cost and liability on a range of to of the disputed amount  depending on our assessment of the likely outcome of the dispute 
conversely  for billing errors in our favor  such as the vendor s failure to invoice us for new service  we record an estimate for the related cost and liability based on the full amount that we should have been invoiced 
disputed costs  both in the vendors favor and our favor  are researched and discussed with vendors on an ongoing basis until ultimately resolved 
estimates are periodically reviewed by management and modified in light of new information or developments  if any 
conversely  any resolved disputes which will result in a credit over the disputed amounts are recognized in the appropriate month when the resolution has been determined 
because estimates regarding disputed costs include assessments of uncertain outcomes  such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
accrued liabilities 
similar to accruals for disputed telecommunications costs above  it is necessary for us to estimate other significant costs such as utilities and sales  use  telecommunications and other taxes 
these estimates are often necessary either because invoices for services are not received on a timely basis from our vendors or by virtue of the complexity surrounding the costs 
in every instance in which an estimate is necessary  we record the related cost and liability based on all available facts and circumstances  including but not limited to historical trends  related usage  forecasts and quotes 
estimates are periodically reviewed by management and modified in light of new information or developments  if any 
because estimates regarding accrued liabilities include assessments of uncertain outcomes  such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
restructuring liability 
when circumstances warrant  we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations 
when such a change is made  management will estimate the costs to exit a business or restructure ongoing operations 
the components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent management s best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation 
management periodically reviews its restructuring estimates and assumptions relative to new information  if any  of which it becomes aware 
should circumstances warrant  management will adjust its previous estimates to reflect what it then believes to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs 
because management s estimates and assumptions regarding restructuring costs include probabilities of future events  such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances  changes in market conditions  regulatory changes  changes in existing business practices and other circumstances that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
a change in our restructuring estimates in a future period  compared to the million restructuring liability at december  would result in an million expense or benefit in the statement of operations during the period in which the change in estimate occurred 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
since inception we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets 
although we consider the potential for future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no

 beginning in the first quarter of we are evaluating the requirements under sfas no

however  the actual effect on net income or loss and earnings or loss per share after adopting sfas no 
r will vary depending upon the number of options granted in compared to prior years 
in addition  we will also recognize compensation expense related to our employee stock purchase plan for the six month purchase period ending june  we have modified our employee stock purchase plan to make it a non compensatory plan for all purchase periods subsequent to june  based on the level of participation and volatility of our stock in  we estimate that compensation expense will be less than million per purchase period in results of operations revenue is generated primarily from the sale of internet connectivity services at fixed rates or usage based pricing to our customers that desire a ds or faster connection and related data center services 
in addition to our connectivity and data center services  we also provide premised based route optimization products and other ancillary services  such as cdn  server management and installation services  virtual private networking services  managed security services  data backup  remote storage and restoration services 
direct cost of revenue is comprised primarily of costs for connecting to and accessing internet network service providers and competitive local exchange providers  costs related to operating and maintaining network access points and data centers  costs incurred for providing additional third party services to our customers and  costs of flow control platform solution and similar products sold 
to the extent a network access point is located a distance from the respective internet network service providers  we may incur additional local loop charges on a recurring basis 
connectivity costs vary depending on customer demands and pricing variables while network access point facility costs are generally fixed in nature 
direct cost of revenue does not include compensation  depreciation or amortization 
customer support costs consist primarily of employee compensation costs for employees engaged in connecting customers to our network  installing customer equipment into network access point facilities  and servicing customers through our network operations centers 
in addition  facilities costs associated with the network operations center are included in customer support costs 
product development costs consist principally of compensation and other personnel costs  consultant fees and prototype costs related to the design  development and testing of our proprietary technology  enhancement of our network management software and development of internal systems 
costs for software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed are capitalized upon establishing technological feasibility and ending when the software is available for general release to customers 
costs associated with internal use software are capitalized when the software enters the application development stage until implementation of the software has been completed 
all other product development costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing costs consist of compensation  commissions and other costs for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support functions  as well as advertising  tradeshows  direct response programs  new service point launch events  management of our web site and other promotional costs 
general and administrative costs consist primarily of compensation and other expense for executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate costs 
the revenue and income potential of our business and market is unproven  and our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our prospects 
although we have been in existence since  we have incurred significant operational restructurings in recent years  which have included substantial changes in our senior management team  a reduction in headcount from a high of employees to employees at december   streamlining our cost structure  consolidating network access points  terminating certain non strategic real estate leases and license arrangements and moving our corporate office from seattle  washington to atlanta  georgia to further reduce costs 
we have incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since we began operations in may as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenue  selected statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  revenue costs and expense direct cost of revenue  exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown below customer support product development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization restructuring costs other operating expense total operating costs and expense loss from operations total other expense  net net loss years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  revenue ip services data center services cdn  edge appliance and other the increase in total revenue was primarily attributable to increases in data center services revenue of million  or  to million 
this increase principally results from growth in new and existing customers as we have expanded our available data center space 
a generally positive technology services environment along with a continued focus on selling and managing data center services also contributed to the revenue increase compared to the year ended december  similar to past years  revenue for the three months ending december  was also modestly enhanced by our customers increased holiday traffic  much of which was subject to bursting rates for exceeding rate caps 
revenue from our edge appliance products contributed million of revenue for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
offsetting the increase in revenue from data center services and edge appliance products were decreases of million from ip connectivity services and decreases of million in non recurring and other revenue 
although the number of ip customers and volume has increased during the year ended december   revenue from ip connectivity services continues to decrease as a result of repricing of our customer base 
non recurring and other revenue includes termination fees and service revenue from vpn  managed security  managing customer premise equipment  and data storage services 
our customer base increased by more than customers to approximately  at december   an increase from december  while our customer base grew from a year ago  revenue per customer continued to decrease due to price reductions in charges for our internet connectivity services necessitated by general market conditions 
we expect a continuing trend of future revenue increases to include an increasing percentage of revenue from non connectivity products and services than in the past  particularly from data centers and the sale of our fcp solution and other edge appliance technology 
one of our largest data center customer s contract expired as of december  and was not renewed due largely to the customer s financial constraints 
because of the customer s financial status  substantially all of the customer s uncollected revenue and accounts receivable were reserved as services were invoiced 
at december   we believe the financial statements accurately reflect collectible revenue and accounts receivable for this customer 
in spite of the loss of this customer  we fully anticipate the lost revenue to be more than replaced from new and existing customers 
direct cost of revenue 
direct cost of revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
our gross margins  defined as revenue less direct cost of revenue excluding depreciation and amortization expense  improved to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in this increase in gross margin is a result of our leveraging fixed data center and other service point facility costs over an increased customer base and negotiating lower rates with service providers 
the increase of million in direct cost of revenues was primarily due to increased costs related to expanded data centers  representing million  offset by decreases in costs from our ip connectivity services of million due to favorable contract negotiations with service providers and improved network efficiencies 
the increase was also offset by decreased expenses related to p nap facility costs and decreased cdn expense of million each 
connectivity costs vary based upon customer traffic and other demand based pricing variables 
data center costs have substantial fixed cost components  primarily for rent  but also significant demand based pricing variables 
edge appliance and cdn and other costs associated with reseller arrangements are generally variable in nature 
we expect all of these costs to continue to increase during as revenue increases 
data center services are giving us access to new customers in which we can bundle hosting and connectivity services together  potentially generating greater combined gross margins 
at december   we had approximately  square feet of data center space with a utilization rate of approximately 
customer support 
customer support expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase of million is comparable to revenue growth and was primarily driven by compensation and benefits of million for higher staffing levels  along with increases of million in costs for outside professional services 
product development 
product development costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily driven by a decrease of million in compensation and employee benefits  along with a million decrease in office equipment maintenance costs 
the decrease in compensation and employee benefit costs were related to organizational changes that allowed us to reprioritize projects and more efficiently utilize certain employees 
the decrease in product development costs is also attributed to the capitalization of certain project development costs in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in outside professional service expense of million 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing costs for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  due to an increased focus for marketing edge appliances and technology and expansion in the asia pacific region 
the net increase of million was primarily due to increases in commissions and other compensation expense of million as well as increases in outside professional services totaling million  and a million increase in facility expense 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in marketing related expenses of million 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million primarily reflects a million gross reduction in taxes  licenses  and fees  a million decrease in outside professional services  million reduction in facility  communication  and office equipment  repairs  and maintenance expense  and a million decrease in bad debt expense 
these reductions were partially offset by increases of million in employee compensation and benefits 
the reduction in taxes  licenses and fees related to the combination of an accrual in july for an assessment from the new york state department of taxation and finance for million  including interest and penalties  resulting from an audit of our state franchise tax returns for the years and a reduction of the accrual in april when we became aware that the assessment had been reduced to million  including interest and with penalties waived 
the substantial decrease from the original assessment was a result of including the weighted averages of investment capital and subsidiary capital  along with business capital  used in new york in determining the apportionment factor 
the original assessment was based solely on an apportionment of business capital  while investment capital and subsidiary capital both have significantly lower apportionment percentages to new york 
the decrease in outside professional services of million is largely due to substantially less use of consultants and contractors in compared to the sarbanes oxley initiatives and implementation in the improvement in facility and related costs are attributed to focused cost controls and a much more centrally managed purchasing function 
the reduction in bad debt expense is due largely to an accrual for a large customer balance in along with more favorable collections experience in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including other intangible assets  for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated during  which were not replaced by the same level of purchases of property and equipment as during prior years 
restructuring cost 
for the year ended december  we incurred less than million of additional restructuring costs 
these additional costs were primarily the result of a change in estimated expenses related to real estate obligations 
for the year ended december   the net charge of million to restructuring resulted from an increase of million relating to real estate obligations offset by a reduction of million pertaining to network infrastructure and other obligations 
after reviewing the analysis in the third quarter of  management concluded that the facilities remaining in the restructuring accrual were taking longer than expected to sublease and those that were subleased resulted in lower than expected sublease rates 
consequently  the projected obligations exceeded the unadjusted liability by million over the remaining lease terms 
during the quarter ended september   all remaining contractual obligations for network infrastructure and other costs included in the restructuring were satisfied and we reduced the remaining recorded liability for the obligations from million to zero 
years ended december  and year ended december  revenue ip services data center services cdn  edge appliance and other revenue 
revenue for increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
our largest increase in revenue came from data center services  which increased million  or  to million for compared to million for and our edge appliance products contributed million of revenue for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
revenue for ip connectivity services increased slightly to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively  in spite of continued industry wide intense pricing pressures 
these overall increases in revenue were primarily due to an increase in our customer base of approximately customers  a increase 
while our customer base grew from a year ago  revenue per customer decreased due to price reductions in charges for our internet connectivity services necessitated by general market conditions 
we expect the composition of any future revenue increases will include an increasing percentage of revenue from non connectivity products and services than in the past  particularly from the sale of our edge appliance technology  which includes our fcp solution 
direct cost of revenue 
direct cost of revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of 
for the year ended december   our revenue less direct cost of revenue improved to million compared to million for the same period in this increase is a result of our leveraging of fixed data center and other service point facility costs over an increased customer base and negotiating lower rates with service providers 
the decrease of million in direct cost of revenues was due to reduced network service provider costs and lower local loop pass through costs of million 
off setting the decrease in network service provider costs and lower local loop pass through costs were an increase in data center services expense of million due to the increased usage of these services by our customers  along with increases in channel  technology  and preferred colocation partner product cost of million 
an additional increase of million in direct cost of revenue is attributed to resale of network equipment  resulting from acquisitions completed by us in  along with an increase of million pertaining to facilities costs 
connectivity costs vary based upon customer traffic and other demand based pricing variables and are expected to continue to decrease during  even with modest revenue growth  due to the full year effect of pricing improvements negotiated during cdn and other costs associated with reseller arrangements are generally variable in nature 
we expect these costs to continue to increase during as revenue increases 
customer support 
customer support expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily driven by compensation and benefits of million for higher staffing levels  along with decreases of million in communications 
product development 
product development costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the net decrease of million primarily reflects the redeployment of technical resources from product support to network support in general and administrative expense offset by new hiring for other responsibilities 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing costs for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase of million was primarily due to an increase in quota bearing resources as well as the commensurate expenses associated with the new hires 
a portion of these increases can also be attributed to increased training and productivity improvements 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase of million primarily reflects increases of million in outside professional services  million in office equipment repairs and maintenance  million in employee compensation  million in tax  license  and fees and million in communications costs 
consulting and outside professional services principally include compliance costs related to the sarbanes oxley act of also included in the increase is the million from redeployment of certain technical resources from product development to network support 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization  including other intangible assets  for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated during  which were not replaced by the same level of purchases of property and equipment as during prior years 
restructuring cost benefit 
we incurred restructuring costs of million during the year ended december  as a result of a comprehensive analysis of the remaining accrued restructuring liability 
during the quarter ended september   a new sublease was negotiated on one abandoned property and new terms involving a reconfiguration of usable and abandoned space were negotiated with the lessor on another abandoned property  both of which were included in the original restructuring 
the last of our restructured network infrastructure obligations was also terminated during the quarter ended september  the net charge to restructuring resulted from an increase of million relating to real estate obligations offset by a reduction of million pertaining to network infrastructure and other obligations 
after reviewing the analysis in the third quarter of  management concluded that the facilities remaining in the restructuring accrual are taking longer than expected to sublease and those that were subleased resulted in lower than expected sublease rates 
consequently  the currently projected obligations exceeded the unadjusted liability by million over the remaining lease terms  with the last commitment expiring in july all of these leases arose from our acquisition of co space 
the network infrastructure obligations represented amounts to be incurred under contractual obligations in existence at the time the restructuring plan was initiated 
during the quarter ended september   all other remaining contractual obligations for network infrastructure and other costs included in the restructuring were satisfied and we reduced the remaining recorded liability for the obligations from million to zero 
restructuring costs were million for reflecting non cash restructuring plan adjustments and write downs net of additional restructuring and impairment charges 
other expense  net 
other expense  net consists of interest income  interest and financing expense  investment losses and other non operating expense 
other expense  net for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily to million less interest expense from carrying less debt than in the prior year

our capital expenditures were principally comprised of leasehold improvements related to the upgrade of several data center facilities

the purchase of property and equipment related to the purchase of assets for our network infrastructure and the cost related to the relocation of nine network access points 
net cash from financing activities 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of our equity securities  capital leases and bank loans 
see liquidity below 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
cash used in financing activity included principal payments on notes payable of million and payments on capital lease obligations of million 
these payments were partially offset by proceeds received from the exercise of stock options of million 
as a result of these activities  we had million in notes payable and million in capital lease obligations as of december  with million in notes payable and capital leases scheduled as due within the next months 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
in september  we negotiated the buy out of all remaining lease schedules under a master lease agreement with a primary supplier of network equipment 
under the terms of the buy out agreement  we paid the supplier million  representing remaining capital lease payment obligations  end of lease asset values and sales tax 
the million buy out was paid with million in cash on hand and the proceeds from the new million term loan from a bank 
on march   we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a purchase price of per share which resulted in net proceeds to us of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expense 
we continue to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes 
general corporate purposes primarily include capital investments in our network access point infrastructure and systems  expansion of data center facilities and repayment of debt and capital lease obligations 
general corporate purposes could also include potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
in addition  we received million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the year ended december  cash used in financing activities included million toward reducing our notes payable and aforementioned capital lease obligations and million to repay the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility

the net proceeds of million from issuance of common stock was received in august when we completed the sale  pursuant to a private placement  of million shares of our common stock  par value per share  at a price of per share 
capital equipment leases have been used since inception to finance the majority of our networking equipment located in our network access points other than leasehold improvements related to our data center facilities 
payments under capital lease agreements totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity we have a history of quarterly and annual period net losses 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we may incur additional operating losses in the future 
given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate  we cannot guarantee that we will sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our failure to do so would adversely affect our business  including our ability to raise additional funds 
although we experienced positive operating cash flow for the year ended december   we have a history of negative operating cash flow and have depended upon equity and debt financings  as well as borrowings under our credit facilities  to meet our cash requirements 
in  we expect a steady increase in cash flows from operations based on current projections in our business plan 
we expect to meet our cash requirements in through a combination of cash from operating cash flows  existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in marketable securities  borrowings under our credit facilities and proceeds from our public offering in march of our capital requirements depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our services  the ability to expand and retain our customer base  and other factors 
if our cash requirements vary materially from those currently planned  if our cost reduction initiatives have unanticipated adverse effects on our business  or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from the sales of our services  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
provisions in our existing credit facility limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
revolving credit facility 
at december   we had a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan under a loan and security agreement with a bank 
the agreement was reviewed amended as of december   to reduce the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit agreement from million to million  increase letter of credit sub limit from million to million  to extend the expiration date of the revolving credit facility from december  to december  and update loan covenants 
availability under the revolving credit facility is based on of eligible accounts receivable plus of unrestricted cash and marketable investments 
as of december   million of letters of credit were issued  and we had available million in borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
the credit facility contains certain covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur further indebtedness 
the december  changes to the loan covenants include the elimination of the minimum cash ebitda requirement  as defined by the agreement  and the addition of a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
as of december   we were in compliance with the various loan covenants 
we were in violation of a previous loan covenant that required a minimum cash ebitda  as defined in the credit facility  for the three month period ended september  by million 
the violation resulted primarily from our continued expansion of data center facilities that caused the minimum cash ebitda for the period to be less than the level required under the agreement 
on november   we received a formal waiver of the covenant violation 
as discussed above  the agreement was amended as of december  to eliminate the minimum cash ebitda requirement 
note payable to financial institutions 
the million term loan noted with the revolving credit facility above has a fixed interest rate of and is due in equal monthly installments of principal plus interest through september  the balance outstanding at december  was million 
proceeds from the loan were used to purchase assets recorded as capital leases under a master agreement with a primary supplier of networking equipment 
the loan is secured by all of our  except patents 
commitments and other obligations 
we have commitments and other obligations that are contractual in nature and will represent a use of cash in the future unless there are modifications to the terms of those agreements 
network commitments primarily represent purchase commitments made to our largest bandwidth vendors and contractual payments to license data center space used for resale to customers 
our ability to improve cash used in operations in the future would be negatively impacted if we do not grow our business at a rate that would allow us to offset the service commitments with corresponding revenue growth 
the following table summarizes our credit obligations and future contractual commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years note payable capital lease obligations operating lease commitments service commitments note payable does not include interest expense of million and million due in less than one year and between one and three years  respectively 
capital lease obligations include imputed interest expense of less than million 
common and preferred stock 
effective september   all shares of our outstanding series a convertible preferred stock were mandatorily converted into common stock in accordance with the terms our certificate of incorporation 
an aggregate of million shares of convertible preferred stock with a recorded value of million was converted into million shares of common stock during the quarter ended september  accordingly  we had no shares of series a convertible preferred stock outstanding subsequent to the mandatory conversion 
the mandatory conversion had no effect on the outstanding warrants to purchase common stock that were issued in conjunction with the series a preferred stock 
on march   we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a purchase price of per share which resulted in net proceeds to us of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expense 
we continue to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes 
general corporate purposes primarily include capital investments in our network access point infrastructure and systems  expansion of data center facilities and repayment of debt and capital lease obligations 
general corporate purposes could also include potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
on august   we completed a private placement of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received million  net of issuance costs 
because we issued shares of our common stock in the private placement at a price below the conversion price of the series a preferred stock at that time  the number of shares of common stock into which the outstanding shares of series a preferred stock were convertible increased by million shares 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we recorded a deemed dividend of million  which was attributable to the additional incremental number of shares the series a preferred stock convertible into common stock 
lease facilities 
since our inception  we have financed the purchase of substantial network routing equipment using capital leases with a primary supplier 
as discussed below  we negotiated the buy out of all remaining lease schedules under a master lease agreement with the primary supplier in september our future minimum lease payments on remaining capital lease obligations at december  totaled million  with million representing the present value of minimum lease payments 
the negotiated buy out of all remaining lease schedules under the master lease agreement with the supplier of network equipment included a cash payment of million  comprising remaining capital lease obligations as of september   along with end of lease asset values and sales tax  resulting in a million increase to fixed assets 
the million buy out was funded through million in cash on hand and the proceeds from the aforementioned million term loan from a bank 
as of december   our other remaining capital lease has an expiration date of june restructuring and impairment costs with overcapacity created in the internet connectivity market and ip services market  we implemented restructuring plans that resulted in significant charges in and for real estate and network infrastructure obligations  personnel and other charges 
additional charges were also incurred during and as we continued to evaluate our restructuring reserve 
we may incur additional changes in future periods 
restructuring costs 
for the year ended december   we incurred million in restructuring costs which primarily represented retention bonuses and moving expenses related to the relocation of our corporate office to atlanta  georgia from seattle  washington 
restructuring costs 
we incurred net additional restructuring costs of million during as a result of a comprehensive analysis of the remaining accrued restructuring liability 
after reviewing the analysis  management concluded that the facilities remaining in the restructuring accrual were taking longer than expected to sublease and those that were subleased resulted in lower than expected sublease rates 
consequently  the projected obligations exceeded the unadjusted liability by million over the remaining lease terms  with the last commitment expiring in july during the quarter ended september   all other remaining contractual obligations for network infrastructure and other costs included in the restructuring were satisfied and we reduced the remaining recorded liability for the obligations from million to zero 
restructuring costs 
restructuring charges totaling less than million during primarily resulted from a change in estimated expenses related to real estate obligations

we are unable to assert control over the joint venture s operational and financial policies and practices required to account for the joint venture as a subsidiary whose assets  liabilities  revenue and expense would be consolidated due to certain minority interest protections afforded to our joint venture partners 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  there were warrants outstanding to purchase million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents 
we maintain cash and short term deposits at our financial institutions 
due to the short term nature of our deposits  they are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents mature within three months 
other investments 
we have a million equity investment in aventail  an early stage  privately held company  after having reduced the balance for an impairment loss of million in this strategic investment is inherently risky  in part because the market for the products or services being offered or developed by aventail has not been proven 
because of risk associated with this investment  we could lose our entire initial investment in aventail 
furthermore we have invested million in internap japan  our joint venture with ntt me corporation and another ntt affiliate 
this investment is accounted for using the equity method and to date we have recognized million in equity method losses  representing our proportionate share of the aggregate joint venture losses and income 
furthermore  the joint venture investment is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in addition  the market for services being offered by internap japan has not been proven and may never materialize 
notes payable 
as of december  we had notes payable recorded at their present value of million bearing a rate of interest which we believe is commensurate with their associated market risk 
capital leases 
as of december  we had capital leases recorded at million reflecting the present value of future lease payments 
we believe the interest rates used in calculating the present values of these lease payments are a reasonable approximation of fair value and their associated market risk is minimal 
credit facility 
as of december  we had million available under our revolving credit facility with a bank  and the balance outstanding under the million term loan was million 
the interest rate for the loan was fixed at 
the interest rate under the revolving credit facility is variable and was at december  we believe these interest rates are reasonable approximations of fair value and the market risk in minimal 
interest rate risk 
our objective in managing interest rate risk is to maintain favorable long term fixed rate or a balance of fixed and variable rate debt that will lower our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
currently  our strategy for managing interest rate risk does not include the use of derivative securities 
the table below presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for our debt obligations that extend beyond one year as of december  dollars in thousands fair value long term debt term loan interest rate foreign currency risk 
substantially all of our revenue is currently in united states dollars and from customers primarily in the united states 
therefore  we do not believe we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
