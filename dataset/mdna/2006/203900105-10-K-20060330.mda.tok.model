critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts receivable based on specific identification of doubtful accounts 
this involves a degree of judgement based on discussion with our internal sales and marketing groups  our customer base and the examination of the financial stability of our customers 
there can be no assurance that our estimates will match actual amounts ultimately written off 
during periods of downturn in the market for our products or economic recession  a greater degree of risk exists concerning the ultimate collectability of our accounts receivable due to the impact that these conditions might have on our customer base 
sales returns an allowance is established for possible return of products  rebates and advertising allowances 
the amount of the allowance is an estimate  which is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return and other factors 
though management considers these allowances adequate and proper  changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that could affect the adequacy of this allowance 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for overstock and obsolescence are estimated and recorded to reduce the carrying value to estimated net realizable value 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
though management considers these reserves adequate and proper  changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could materially affect the adequacy of this reserve 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating the company s current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
the valuation allowance for deferred income tax benefits is determined based upon the expectation of whether the benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
warranty we provide a standard product warranty program for our product lines and a five year warranty on certain equipment purchased from two vendors and installed at our customer locations 
we provide reserves for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on our warranty policy or applicable contractual warranty  our historical experience of known product failure rates  our vendors experience and use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical experience are among the factors that could affect the adequacy of this reserve 
goodwill impairment beginning in  goodwill is required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment  and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying value  an impairment must be recorded 
as of december   and the company had net goodwill of   and  respectively 
carrying amounts of goodwill by segment as of december  is as follows suttle  transition networks  jdl technologies  the jdl technologies segment experienced lower than expected margins and return on capital invested in fiscal current projections are for margins to increase to more historical levels and return on capital to increase 
if this does not occur according to projections  the reductions in anticipated cash flow in relation the net assets of this segment may indicate that the fair value of this segment is less than book value resulting in an impairment charge against earnings 
at december   the company assessment of the jdl segment indicated that its goodwill was not impaired 
management will continue to evaluate for any potential impairment 
the company believes that accounting estimates related to goodwill impairment are critical because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete  evidenced by persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
related to the suttle and transition networks milan technology segments  the earning process completion is evidenced through the shipment of goods as the terms these segments are fob shipping point and the risk of loss is transferred upon shipment and there are no significant obligations subsequent to that point 
other than the sales returns as discussed above  there are not significant estimates related to revenue recognition for these segments 
jdl technologies  inc segment jdl records revenue on hardware  software and related equipment sales and installation contracts when the products are installed and accepted by the customer 
jdl records revenue on service contracts on a straight line basis over the contract period  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
each contract is individually reviewed to determine when the earnings process is complete 
in  jdl entered into a fixed price contract with a large school district to install and upgrade its network equipment and infrastructure 
revenue under this contract is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
the method used to determine the progress of completion is based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs
