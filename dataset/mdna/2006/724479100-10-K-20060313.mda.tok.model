item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and elsewhere in this report 
overview we were pleased with our financial results in which featured strong growth in revenue and earnings 
we were also pleased with the progress we made throughout as successful execution of our growth strategies resulted in more solutions  for more customers  in more places worldwide 
we are realizing the benefits from our previous actions to strengthen revenue growth  expand into new market spaces and enhance our operating efficiencies 
revenue grew in driven by six growth engines that propelled our momentum through the year and acquisitions  which contributed 
these growth engines included mail services  small business  supplies  international  payment solutions and software 
strategic transactions in included the acquisitions of imagitas  inc  danka canada inc  and compulit  inc we also continued actions to reduce our investment in capital services 
income from continuing operations was million in compared with million in and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was in compared with in in  diluted earnings per share was reduced by restructuring charges of cents  an increase in our tax reserves related to corporate owned life insurance coli of cents and three cents per diluted share relating to foundation contributions 
in  diluted earnings per share was reduced by restructuring charges of cents and five cents resulting from a legal settlement 
we were able to grow our earnings despite increases in interest rates  a higher effective tax rate and reduced earnings contribution from capital services compared to the prior year 
see results of continuing operations for  and for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations 
outlook for we anticipate that we will experience continued strength in our financial results in we expect that revenue growth will continue to be driven by the growth engines discussed above  as we continue to experience a changing mix of our product line  where a greater percentage of the revenue is coming from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and less from larger system sales 
in addition  we expect to continue our market expansion and derive further synergies from our recent acquisitions 
during  we expect to record additional restructuring charges related primarily to the completion of programs initiated in we expect that these charges will be significantly less than in we remain focused on disciplined expense control initiatives and will continue to allocate capital to optimize our returns 
while it is always difficult to predict future economic and interest rate trends  we expect that our interest costs will increase further in due to an increase in rates compared with the prior year 
we will also continue to be impacted by the year over year decline in earnings from capital services  consistent with our strategy for this business 
on february   the united states senate approved postal reform legislation 
on july   the house of representatives passed its version of the bill on postal reform 
the legislation is currently being referred to a joint house and senate committee to reconcile the differences between the two bills 
we are confident that the legislation  which ultimately emerges from the house senate conference committee  will be beneficial

capital services capital services strategy in december  our board of directors approved a plan to pursue a sponsored spin off of our capital services external financing business 
the new entity spinco would be an independent publicly traded company consisting of most of the assets in our capital services segment 
on march   pitney bowes credit corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  entered into a subscription agreement with cerberus capital management  lp through its investment vehicle  jcc management llc investor 
under the terms of the subscription agreement  the investor is expected to invest in excess of million for common and preferred stock representing up to of the voting interest and up to economic interest in the spun off entity 
the subscription agreement anticipates that pitney bowes stockholders would receive of the common stock of spinco in a tax free distribution 
in accordance with the subscription agreement  both parties have the right to terminate this agreement at march  the subscription agreement was filed as exhibit to the quarterly report on form q for the three months ended march  we estimate that we would incur after tax transaction costs of about million to million in connection with the spin off 
the majority of these costs would be incurred at the time of the spin off 
these costs are composed primarily of professional fees  taxes on asset transfers and lease contract termination fees 
in addition  in accordance with current accounting guidelines  at the time of the spin off we would be required to compare the book and fair market values of the assets and liabilities spun off and record any resulting deficit as a charge in discontinued operations 
we currently estimate this potential non cash after tax charge to be in the range of million to million 
the ultimate amount of this charge  if any  would be determined by the fair market value of spinco at the time of the spin off and the resolution of the related tax liabilities 
the spin off is not subject to a vote by pitney bowes stockholders 
the transaction is subject to regulatory review and other customary conditions 
in january  we received a favorable ruling from the irs that the spin off would be tax free to our stockholders 
in march  based on a recent communication we initiated  the sec staff indicated that we would need to include three years of historical audited financial statements for pitney bowes credit corporation  the legal entity holding the assets of the capital services external financing business rather than for the capital services business alone 
fulfillment of this requirement could extend the timeframe for completion of the spin into the first half of as a result  consistent with our previously stated desire to exit the capital services business in a way that maximizes stockholder value  we are assessing a broader range of asset and business disposition options  including spin off  a sale of the business  or sale of all or a portion of the assets 
several factors  including improved economic conditions  make this range of options more attractive now  than when we first announced our intention to look at options for exiting this business in january in july  we received notice of termination of our agreement to provide future lease financing to imagistics international  inc this agreement was replaced with successive thirty day lease financing agreements that have been extended each month since october in march  we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to sell our imagistics international  inc lease portfolio for approximately million to de lage landen  a subsidiary of rabobank nv 
the final purchase price will be a function of the receivables balance in the portfolio at closing 
this lease portfolio is part of the external financing assets included in the proposed spin off 
the completion of the sale of the imagistics lease portfolio is subject to customary closing conditions 
in addition  if we decide to pursue the spin off in its current form  the sale will be subject to receipt of a supplemental internal revenue service ruling that the proposed spin off of our capital services external financing business would be tax free to pitney bowes stockholders 
the imagistics lease portfolio contributed approximately five cents to our diluted earnings per share in and capital services portfolio our investment in capital services assets included in our consolidated balance sheets is composed of the following december dollars in millions leveraged leases finance receivables rental property and equipment  net total leveraged leases our investment in leveraged lease assets is composed of the following december dollars in millions rental receivables residual value principal and interest on non recourse loans unearned income investment in leveraged leases less deferred taxes related to leveraged leases net investment in leveraged leases rental receivables represent total lease payments from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases 
residual value represents the value of the property anticipated at the end of the leveraged lease terms and is based on appraisals or other sources of estimated value 
we review the recorded residual value for impairments deemed to be other than temporary at least once annually and record adjustments as appropriate 
principal and interest on non recourse loans represent amounts due to unrelated third parties from our customers over the remaining term of the leveraged leases 
the non recourse loans are secured by the lessees rental obligations and the leased property 
if a lessee defaults and if the amounts realized from the sale of these assets are insufficient  we have no obligation to make any payments due on these non recourse loans to the unrelated third parties 
accordingly  we are required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap to subtract the principal and interest over the remaining term of the non recourse loans from our rental receivables and residual value 
at december  and  the principal balances on the non recourse loans totaled billion and billion  respectively  and the related interest payments over the remaining terms of the leases totaled billion and billion  respectively 
unearned income represents our future financing income that will be earned over the remaining term of the leases 
investment in leveraged leases represents the amount that is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
the investment in leveraged leases in our consolidated balance sheets is diversified across the following types of assets december dollars in millions original lease term in years locomotives and rail cars postal equipment commercial aircraft commercial real estate telecommunications rail and bus shipping and handling investment in leveraged leases at december   approximately of our total leveraged lease portfolio is further secured by equity defeasance accounts or other third party credit arrangements 
in addition  at december   approximately of the remaining leveraged lease portfolio represents leases to highly rated government related organizations that have guarantees or supplemental credit enhancements upon the occurrence of certain events 
finance receivables capital services finance receivables are composed of the following december dollars in millions large ticket single investor leases imagistics lease portfolio total finance receivables rental property and equipment  net rental property and equipment  net is composed of the following december dollars in millions commercial real estate imagistics lease portfolio rail and other total rental property and equipment  net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions at december  and  our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions  net of related debt and minority interest  was million and million  respectively  which is composed of transactions with us airlines of million and million  respectively  and foreign airlines of million and million  respectively 
our net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing portfolio is composed of investments in leveraged lease transactions  direct financing lease transactions and a portion of our investment in pbg capital partners llc pbg 
risk of loss under these transactions is primarily related to the inability of the airline to make underlying lease payments  our inability to generate sufficient cash flows either through the sale of the aircraft or secondary lease transactions to recover our net investment  and or in the case of the leveraged lease portfolio  the default of an equity defeasance or other third party credit arrangements 
at december   approximately of our remaining net investment in commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing investments was further secured by approximately million of equity defeasance accounts or third party credit arrangements 
during the first quarter of  japan airlines exercised its early buy out option 
we received approximately million from this transaction  reflecting the net investment at that time 
during the second quarter of  we sold the aircraft associated with our remaining leases with united air lines 
we received approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million  net of minority interest  from this transaction 
off balance sheet items finance receivable sales as part of our capital services programs  we have from time to time sold  through securitizations  net finance receivables with limited recourse 
in these transactions  we have surrendered control over the transferred assets in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  and received a cash payment from the transferee 
specifically  the finance receivables were sold to a bankruptcy remote limited liability company 
in certain cases  at the time of sale  we obtained legal counsel s opinion that the assets were isolated and that the sale qualified as a true sale at law 
under the terms of the sale  the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received 
there are no conditions that both constrain the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provide more than a trivial benefit to the transferor 
we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
we have accounted for these transactions as a sale  recognizing assets obtained and liabilities incurred in consideration for proceeds of the sale 
any resulting gain or loss was recognized in income at the time of sale 
the maximum risk of loss in these transactions arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts 
we believe adequate provisions for losses have been established for receivables sold which may become uncollectible and for which we have recourse obligation  in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
in selective cases  when we have sold net finance receivables  we entered into guarantee contracts with varying amounts of recourse in privately placed transactions with unrelated third party investors 
the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and guarantee contracts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in accordance with gaap  we do not record these amounts as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our maximum risk of loss on these net finance receivables and guarantee contracts arises from the possible non performance of lessees to meet the terms of their contracts and from changes in the value of the underlying equipment 
these contracts are secured by the underlying equipment value  and supported by the creditworthiness of our customers 
at december  and  the underlying equipment value exceeded the sum of the uncollected principal balance of receivables sold and the guarantee contracts 
as part of our review of our risk exposure  we believe we have made adequate provision for sold receivables and guarantee contracts which may not be collectible 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges in connection with our previously announced restructuring initiatives  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the charge is net of a million gain on the sale of our main plant manufacturing facility

these charges relate primarily to the completion of programs initiated in the ultimate amount and timing of the restructuring charges may differ from our current estimates 
the cash outflows related to restructuring charges are funded primarily by cash from operating activities 
the restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to increase our operating efficiency and effectiveness in and beyond while enhancing growth  primarily as a result of reduced personnel related expenses 
we realized incremental pre tax benefits of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  from these restructuring initiatives and currently estimate incremental pre tax benefits from these initiatives of approximately million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy related to restructuring charges 
the pre tax restructuring charges are composed of dollars in millions restructuring charges non cash charges cash payments balance december severance and benefit costs asset impairments other exit costs severance and benefit costs asset impairments other exit costs severance and benefit costs asset impairments other exit costs gain on sale of main plant all restructuring charges  except for asset impairments  will result in cash outflows 
the severance and benefit costs relate to a reduction in workforce of approximately  employees worldwide from the inception of this plan through december  and expected future workforce reductions of approximately employees 
the workforce reductions relate to actions across several of our businesses resulting from infrastructure and process improvements and our continuing efforts to streamline operations  and include managerial  professional  clerical and technical roles

in march  we issued million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in march these notes bear interest at an annual rate of and pay interest semi annually beginning september the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper  financing of acquisitions and the repurchase of company stock 
we believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally  money from existing credit agreements  debt issued under new and existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper programs 
information on debt maturities is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes our known contractual obligations at december  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years commercial paper borrowings long term debt and current portion of long term debt non cancelable capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other non current liabilities relate primarily to our non pension postretirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures during  capital expenditures included net additions of million to property  plant and equipment and million of net additions to rental equipment and related inventories compared with million and million  respectively  in the addition of rental equipment relates primarily to postage meters and increased over the prior year due to higher placements of our digital meters during we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately the same as these investments will also be affected by the timing of our customers transition to digital meters 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the md a 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  customer cancellations  bad debts  inventory obsolescence  residual values of leased assets  useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation  and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with gaap 
revenue recognition multiple element and internal financing arrangements we derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales  rentals  financing and services 
certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources 
the most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease  a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement 
as a result  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
in multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved 
our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values  which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions 
revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments 
we then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices 
we provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases 
we classify our leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
the vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria outlined in sfas no 
we believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk with no important uncertainties with respect to future costs 
accordingly  we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue  the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables 
the difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease 
equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term 
estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience 
we also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products  product retirement and future product launch plans  end of lease customer behavior  regulatory changes  remanufacturing strategies  used equipment markets  if any  competition and technological changes 
we evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur 
we have not experienced any material changes to our residual values during  or nor do we expect any material changes to residual values in the foreseeable future 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  length of time receivables are past due  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
based on historical experience  we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for credit losses we estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly 
we establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed 
we charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible 
we base credit decisions primarily on a customer s financial strength 
we believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification 
in addition  in our capital services programs  we have considered collateral values 
our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over days is to discontinue revenue recognition 
we resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to days or less past due 
in our capital services programs  we discontinue revenue recognition as soon as it is apparent that the obligor will not be making payments in accordance with lease terms  such as in the event of bankruptcy 
otherwise  we discontinue revenue recognition when accounts are over days past due or as circumstances warrant 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  the nature and volume of our portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications 
we have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law 
we adjust the amount of reserves when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations 
based on our income from continuing operations before income taxes  a change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately million 
long lived assets useful lives of long lived assets we depreciate property  plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives machinery and equipment principally three to years and buildings up to years 
we depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods 
we amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms 
we amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which is principally three to ten years 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which are principally four to years 
our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions  technology or business plans 
impairment review we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant 
our goodwill impairment review requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
we use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at december  however  future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use 
however  regulations were issued in november  and therefore we do not expect new regulations for the foreseeable future 
new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current digital technology 
significant negative economic or industry trends 
changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets 
significant increase or decrease in our cost of capital 
future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
pension benefits assumptions and estimates our net pension expense  assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates 
we make assumptions relating to discount rates  rate of compensation increase  expected return on plan assets and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following assumptions relate to our us qualified pension plan  which is our largest plan 
we determine our discount rate for the us retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each year s estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate 
these spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds 
accordingly  our discount rate assumption was at december  and at december  the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was and at december  and  respectively 
our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  the plan s asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan 
our expected return on plan assets assumption was in and sensitivity to changes in assumptions discount rate a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
rate of compensation increase a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
delayed recognition principles in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets 
in accordance with this approach we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
investment related risks and uncertainties we invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy 
the composition of our us pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate investments 
investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
in particular  due to the level of risk associated with equity securities  it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results 
new accounting pronouncements in january  fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
our ownership of the equity of pbg qualifies as a variable interest entity under fin no 
pbg was formed with gatx corporation in for the purpose of financing and managing certain leasing related assets 
we adopted the provisions of fin no 
effective march  as a result  we consolidated the operations of pbg on march  prior to march   we accounted for pbg under the equity method of accounting 
pbg s minority interest of million and million respectively is included in other non current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  the consolidation of pbg did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows

and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r requires compensation cost to be recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved  if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period 
we currently use the nominal vesting period approach to determine the pro forma stock based compensation expense for all awards 
sfas no 
r also requires additional disclosures relating to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payments 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r on january  using the modified retrospective application

we are currently evaluating the impact of applying this fsp in the remaining countries in future periods and do not expect the adoption of this provision to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
legal and regulatory matters legal see legal proceedings in item of this form k for information regarding our legal proceedings 
other the european union has instituted two environmental directives that impact our international operations 
the waste electrical and electronic equipment legislation  effective august   makes manufacturers responsible for the disposal of their equipment 
this directive is progressively being rolled out by member states and is expected to be fully implemented in the restriction of hazardous substances directive rohs effective july  requires the removal of substances that are now considered actually or potentially hazardous  from future equipment placements 
as a result of the rohs directive  we are required to modify or change certain components in our products and in some instances these changes will require us to seek re approval for the placement of postage meters from the appropriate postal authorities in each country 
income taxes we are continually under examination by tax authorities in the united states  other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations 
the years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
in december  the irs issued a closing agreement reflecting additional us tax  interest and penalties related to through in january  the irs proposed adjustments that may result in the assessment of additional us tax  interest and penalties related to through we are not disputing certain of these adjustments and the impact of these adjustments has been reflected in our financial statements 
we are disputing other adjustments the irs has proposed that may result in the assessment of additional us tax  interest and penalties related to through these disputed adjustments relate primarily to the tax treatment of coli and related interest expense  the tax effect of the sale of certain preferred share holdings and the tax treatment of certain lease transactions 
the irs will likely make similar adjustments to lease transactions when examining years subsequent to we disagree with these disputed adjustments and intend to contest them 
we have requested a review of these adjustments by the administrative appeals division of the irs 
if negotiations at the administrative appeals level are not successful  we intend to file for judicial review of the disputed adjustments 
the disputed adjustments from through could result in the assessment of additional tax of up to million plus penalties of up to million  a significant portion of which has already been accrued 
certain of these adjustments would result in future tax deductions and  therefore  are only temporary in nature 
we have bonds posted with the irs of million to mitigate interest assessments on any otherwise underpaid tax that would result from a final settlement 
in january  the us circuit court of appeals reversed a district court decision that another company received related to the tax treatment of coli and related interest deductions 
as a result  we recorded an additional tax reserve of million in we have accrued for our best estimate of the probable tax  interest and penalties that may result from these disputed matters as it relates to through and we believe that the accrual for tax liabilities is appropriate 
however  the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange inflation  although moderate in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate 
it increases labor costs and operating expenses  and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
despite these growing costs and the usps meter migration initiatives  we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels  and  to an extent  price increases 
our earnings performance was helped by currency translation gains of approximately one cent per diluted share 
based on the current contribution from our international operations  a increase in the value of the us dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes of approximately million 
although not affecting income  balance sheet related deferred translation losses of million were recorded in resulting from the weaker british pound and euro  partially offset by the stronger canadian dollar  as compared to the us dollar 
during and  we recorded deferred translation gains of million and million relating to the stronger british pound  euro and canadian dollar as compared with the us dollar 
the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations 
exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries  and intercompany loans 
at december   we had approximately million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding  all maturing in  to buy or sell various currencies 
risks arise from the possible non performance by counterparties in meeting the terms of their contracts and from movements in securities values  interest and or exchange rates 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties as they are composed of a number of major international financial institutions 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
dividend policy our board of directors has a policy to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter 
in setting dividend payments  our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements 
we have paid a dividend each year since forward looking statements we want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in this form k  other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
these forward looking statements are those which talk about the company s or management s current expectations as to the future and include  but are not limited to  statements about the amounts  timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings 
words such as estimate  project  plan  believe  expect  anticipate  intend  and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements 
some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include changes in international or national political conditions  including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions  including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products the company s success at managing customer credit risk  including risks associated with commercial passenger and cargo aircraft leasing transactions the company s success at managing costs associated with its strategy of outsourcing functions and operations not central to its business changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations cost  timing and execution of the restructuring plan including any potential asset impairments regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions interrupted use of key information systems changes in privacy laws intellectual property infringement claims impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations terms and timing of actions to reduce exposures and disposal of assets in our capital services segment  including the spin off or other disposition of the majority of the assets in this segment changes in pension and retiree medical costs acts of nature item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations in different foreign currencies 
our objectives in managing our exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts 
the model excludes anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during and  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
