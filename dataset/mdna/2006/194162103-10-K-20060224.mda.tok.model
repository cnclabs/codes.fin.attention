the major foreign currency exposures involve the markets in europe and certain latin american countries  although all regions of the world are subject to foreign currency changes versus the us dollar

however  the use of these techniques to quantify the market risk of such instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of their accuracy or the accuracy of the related assumptions 
market exposures are evaluated using a value at risk var model and an earnings at risk ear model that are intended to measure the maximum potential loss in interest rate and foreign exchange financial instruments  assuming adverse market conditions occur  given a confidence level 
historical interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used to estimate the volatility and correlation of future rates 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value of interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments  calculated using the var model  is not material to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company in and the estimated maximum yearly loss in earnings due to interest rate or foreign exchange rate instruments  calculated utilizing the ear model  is not material to the company s results of operations in and actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets

due to the timing of the company s equity grants the charge will not be spread evenly throughout the year 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required  thereby potentially reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
such amounts cannot be estimated for future periods with certainty because they depend largely on when employees will exercise the stock options and the market price of the company s stock at the time of exercise

critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates 
the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management 
the company s critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directors 
in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
the company s significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options  shipping and handling costs  and inventories 
during  two alternative methods for accounting for stock options were available  the intrinsic value method and the fair value method 
the company used the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options  and accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized 
if the fair value method were used  diluted earnings per share for  and would have decreased approximately 
sfas r will require all companies issuing stock options to implement the fair value method and recognize compensation expense for stock options granted 
as noted above  the company will adopt sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
shipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company reports such costs  primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight  in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  the company s gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales 
if such costs had been included in cost of sales  gross profit margin as a percent to sales would have decreased by bps from to in and decreased by bps and bps in and  respectively  with no impact on reported earnings 
dollars in millions except per share amounts the company accounts for inventories using both the first in  first out fifo method approximately of inventories and the last in  first out lifo method of inventories 
there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for  and had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 
the areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits  asset impairment  tax valuation allowances  and legal and other contingencies 
in pension accounting  the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate for us plans was  and as of december   and  respectively 
discount rates used for the us defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the us plans 
for the company s international plans  the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated aa or better 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for domestic plans was as of december   and in determining the long term rate of return  the company considers the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of return 
the historical rate of return for the us plans for the most recent year period was 
in addition  the current rate of return assumption for the us plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately in fixed income securities which are expected to earn approximately in the long term  in equity securities which are expected to earn approximately in the long term and in real estate and other which are expected to earn approximately in the long term 
a change in either the discount rate or the assumed rate on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact net income by approximately a third assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase  a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return 
this rate was  and as of december   and  respectively 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the most judgmental assumption in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate 
the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate 
in  the assumed rate of increase was for and declining per year until reaching the ultimate assumed rate of increase of per year 
the effect of a increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would reduce net income by approximately asset impairment analysis performed for goodwill and intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of a discount rate 
since the estimated fair value of the company s intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value  significant changes in these estimates would have to occur to result in an impairment charge related to these assets 
asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the restructuring program requires management s best estimate of net realizable value 
tax valuation allowances are established to reduce tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards  to net realizable value 
factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction  carryforward periods  income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income 
a significant change to the company s valuation allowances would primarily impact equity and would not materially impact reported earnings 
legal and other contingency reserves are based on management s assessment of the risk of potential loss  which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors 
such assessments are reviewed each period and revised  based on current facts and circumstances  if necessary 
while it is possible that the company s cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially dollars in millions except per share amounts affected by the one time impacts of the resolution of such contingencies  it is the opinion of management that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  or ongoing results of operations and cash flows 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s contingencies 
the company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms 
while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates  there is a short time frame typically less than days between the shipment of product and cash receipt  thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the company s significant accounting policies 
outlook looking forward into  while the company expects market conditions to remain highly competitive  it believes it is well positioned for continued growth 
it anticipates continuing to prioritize its investments in key categories and markets in order to further strengthen its competitive position and build market share 
the restructuring program is designed to enhance the company s global leadership position in its core businesses 
as part of the restructuring program  the company anticipates streamlining its global supply chain  reallocating resources with an increase and upgrade in the sales  marketing and new product organizations in high potential developing and other key markets and the consolidation of these organizations in certain mature markets 
the savings and benefits from the restructuring program  along with the company s other ongoing cost savings and growth initiatives  are anticipated to provide additional funds for investment in support of key categories and new product development while also supporting an increased level of profitability 
however  as noted above  the company operates in a highly competitive global marketplace that is experiencing increased trade concentration and industry consolidation 
in addition  changes in economic conditions  movements in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates can impact future operating results as measured in us dollars 
in particular  economic and political uncertainty in some countries in latin america and changes in the value of latin american and european currencies may impact the overall results of these regions 
historically  the consumer products industry has been less susceptible to changes in economic growth than many other industries 
over the long term  colgate s continued focus on its consumer products business and the strength of its global brand names  its broad international presence in both developed and developing markets  and its strong capital base all position the company to take advantage of growth opportunities and to increase profitability and shareholder value
