all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is outlined in note to the financial statements 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements  including the following revenue recognition we record revenues and related receivables for health care services at the time the services are provided 
medicare and medicaid revenues represented  and of our net patient revenues during  and  respectively 
revenues from managed care entities  including health 
table of contents maintenance organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs accounted for  and of our net patient revenues during  and  respectively 
we report net patient service revenue at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients and third party payors and others for services rendered 
we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to us at amounts different from our established rates 
payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge  reimbursed costs  discounted charges and per diem payments 
estimates of contractual allowances under managed care plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
we estimate our medicare and medicaid revenues using the latest available financial information  patient utilization data  government provided data and in accordance with applicable medicare and medicaid payment rules and regulations 
the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation and as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by material amounts in the near term 
certain types of payments by the medicare program and state medicaid programs eg medicare disproportionate share hospital  medicare allowable bad debts and inpatient psychiatric services are subject to retroactive adjustment in future periods as a result of administrative review and audit and our estimates may vary from the final settlements 
such amounts are included in accounts receivable  net  on our consolidated balance sheets 
the funding of both federal medicare and state medicaid programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes 
as such  we can not make any assurance that future legislation and regulations  if enacted  will not have a material impact on our future medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
adjustments related to the final settlement of these retrospectively determined amounts did not materially impact our operating results in  and a adjustment to our estimated net revenues recorded in connection with medicare revenues that are subject to retrospective review and settlement as of december   would change our after tax net income by approximately million 
we provide care to patients who meet certain financial or economic criteria without charge or at amounts substantially less than our established rates 
because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care  they are not reported in net revenues or in accounts receivable  net 
our acute care hospitals provided charity care  based on charges at established rates  amounting to million  million and million during  and  respectively 
at our acute care facilities located in the us  medicaid pending accounts comprise the large majority of our receivables that are pending approval from third party payors but we also have smaller amounts due from other miscellaneous payors such as county indigent programs in certain states 
approximately or million as of december  and or million as of december  of our accounts receivable  net  were comprised of medicaid pending accounts 
our patient registration process includes an interview of the patient or the patient s responsible party at the time of registration 
at that time  an insurance eligibility determination is made and an insurance plan code is assigned 
there are various pre established insurance profiles in our patient accounting system which determine the expected insurance reimbursement for each patient based on the insurance plan code assigned and the services rendered 
certain patients may be classified as medicaid pending at registration if we are unable to definitively determine if they are medicaid eligible 
when a patient is registered as medicaid eligible or medicaid pending  our patient accounting system records net revenues for services provided to that patient based upon the established medicaid reimbursement rates pending ultimate disposition of the patient s medicaid and eligibility 

table of contents based on historical hindsight information related to medicaid pending accounts  we estimate that approximately or million of million medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  will subsequently qualify for medicaid pending reimbursement 
approximately or million of the million medicaid pending accounts receivable as of december  subsequently qualified for medicaid pending reimbursement and were therefore appropriately classified at the patient s registration 
the majority of the remaining accounts that ultimately did not qualify for medicaid reimbursement were subsequently reclassified as self pay or charity care accounts 
based on general factors as discussed below in provision for doubtful accounts  our facilities make estimates at each financial reporting period to reserve for amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible 
such estimated uncollectible amounts related to medicaid pending  as well as other accounts receivable payor classifications  are considered when the overall individual facility and company wide reserves are developed 
below are the medicaid pending receivable agings as of december  and amounts in thousands under days days days over days total provision for doubtful accounts collection of receivables from third party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the portion of the bill which is the patient s responsibility  primarily co payments and deductibles 
we estimate our provisions for doubtful accounts based on general factors such as payor mix  the agings of the receivables and historical collection experience 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with these factors and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of the patient accounts and make adjustments to our allowances as warranted 
at our acute care hospitals  third party liability accounts are pursued until all payment and adjustments are posted to the patient account 
for those accounts with a patient balance after third party liability is exhausted  the patient is sent at least two statements followed by a series of three collection letters 
if the patient is deemed unwilling to pay  the account is written off as bad debt and transferred to an outside collection agency for additional collection effort 
uninsured receivables are outsourced to several early out collection agencies under contract with the hospital 
the collection vendor must document at least three attempts to contact the patient and send three statements from the date of placement 
if the patient fails to respond or expresses an unwillingness to pay  the account is returned to the hospital and subsequently written off as bad debt and transferred to an outside agency for additional collection effort 
uninsured patients that express an inability to pay are reviewed for write off as potential charity care 
during the collection process the hospital establishes a partial reserve in the allowance for doubtful accounts for self pay balances outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
all self pay accounts at the hospital level are fully reserved if they become outstanding for greater than days from the date of discharge 
third party liability accounts are fully reserved in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the balance ages past days from the date of discharge 
potential charity accounts are fully reserved when the patient expresses an inability to pay 
on a consolidated basis  we monitor our total self pay receivables to ensure that the total allowance for doubtful accounts provides adequate coverage based on historical collection experience 
at december  and december   accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 

table of contents approximately during  during and during  of our consolidated provision for doubtful accounts  was incurred by our acute care hospitals

estimated losses from asserted and incurred but not reported claims are accrued based on our estimates of the ultimate costs of the claims  which includes costs associated with litigating or settling claims  and the relationship of past reported incidents to eventual claims payments 
all relevant information  including our own historical experience  the nature and extent of existing asserted claims and reported incidents  and independent actuarial analyses of this information  is used in estimating the expected amount of claims 
we also consider amounts that may be recovered from excess insurance carriers  state guaranty funds and other sources in estimating our ultimate net liability for such risk 
we also maintain a self insured workers compensation program 
the ultimate costs related to these programs includes expenses for claims incurred and reported in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported 
our estimated self insured reserves are reviewed and changed  if necessary  at each reporting date and changes are recognized currently as additional expense or as a reduction of expense 
current period adjustments to our reserves for self insured general and professional and workers compensation claims relating to prior periods did not have a material impact on our financial statements during  or

in addition  we also maintain self insured employee benefits programs for employee healthcare and dental claims 
the ultimate costs related to these programs include expenses for claims incurred and paid in addition to an accrual for the estimated expenses incurred in connection with claims incurred but not yet reported 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of our asset based on our estimate of its undiscounted future cash flow 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
fair values are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level as  defined by sfas no 
 on an annual basis or sooner if the indicators of impairment arise 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of each reporting unit 
we have designated september st as our annual impairment assessment date and performed an impairment assessment as of september   which indicated no impairment of goodwill 
future changes in the estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including profitability and market value projections  could indicate impairment in future periods potentially resulting in a write off of a portion or all of our goodwill 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or deductible in future years as a result of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
we believe that future income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets  subject to the valuation allowances we have established 
we operate in multiple jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
we are subject to audits by any of these taxing authorities 
our tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through the year ended december  we believe that adequate accruals have been provided for federal  foreign and state taxes 
the american jobs creation act ajca was signed into law on october  ajca provides for a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated in accordance with the requirement of ajca 
we have evaluated the potential benefit under the act and have concluded it is unlikely we will derive a material benefit 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions  eliminating the alternative previously allowed by sfas no 
to use the intrinsic value method of accounting 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of the instruments using methods similar to those required by sfas no 
and currently used by us to calculate pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures 
the cost will be recognized ratably over the period during which the employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the sec deferred the effective date for sfas r for public companies from the interim to the first annual period beginning after december  accordingly  we adopted sfas no 
r as of january  as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  we will recognize as compensation cost in our financial statements the unvested portion of existing options granted prior to the effective date and the cost of stock options granted to employees after the effective date based on the fair value of the stock options at grant date 
we plan on using black scholes as our option pricing model for applying sfas r 
the transition alternatives include a modified prospective and retroactive methods 
under the retroactive method  all prior periods presented would be restated 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards that subsequently vest or are modified after the beginning of the first period restated 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method for transition purposes 
using the black scholes option pricing model  we would expect to record expense related to stock options outstanding as of december  of approximately million for the year ended december  the stock based compensation expense determined under a fair value method  specifically related to stock options  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these pro forma amounts may not be representative of future expense amounts since the estimated fair value of the stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period  and additional options may be granted in future years 
conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which states that a company must recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
fin clarifies that conditional obligations meet the definition of an asset retirement obligation in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and therefore should be recognized if their fair value is reasonably estimable 
we adopted fin as of december  we conducted a review of each of our properties to determine if we had obligations to perform asset retirement activity which may not be within our control  such as the remediation or removal of asbestos containing materials 
our review did not identify any significant issues pertaining to the provisions of fin and the impact did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position 
accounting changes and error corrections in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which is effective for voluntary changes in accounting principles made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas replaces apb opinion no 
accounting changes apb and statement of financial accounting standards no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas requires that voluntary changes in accounting principle be applied on a retrospective basis to prior period financial statements and eliminates the provisions in apb that cumulative effects of voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized in net income in the period of change 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position 

table of contents physician guarantees and commitments on november   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 application of fasb interpretation no

fin amends fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  to expand the scope to include guarantees granted to a business  such as a physician s practice  or its owner s  that the revenue of the business for a period will be at least a specified amount 
under fin  the accounting requirements of fin are effective for any new revenue guarantees issued or modified on or after january  and the disclosure of all revenue guarantees  regardless of whether they were recognized under fin  is required for all interim and annual periods beginning after january  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position

impact of hurricane katrina in august   our facilities listed below  which comprised of our net revenues during the six months ended june   were severely damaged from hurricane katrina 
since the hurricane  all facilities remain closed and non operational and we continue to assess the damage and the likely recovery period for the facilities and surrounding communities 
methodist hospital located in new orleans  louisiana consisting of methodist hospital methodist  a six story  bed acute care facility and lakeland medical pavilion lakeland  a two story  bed acute care facility 
chalmette medical center located in chalmette  louisiana consisting of chalmette medical center chalmette  a two story  bed acute care facility and virtue street pavilion  a one story  bed facility providing physical rehabilitation  skilled nursing and inpatient behavioral health services 
the majority of the real estate assets of the bed chalmette medical center facility are owned by universal health realty income trust the trust and leased by us 
since these facilities have been closed since the hurricane and therefore no revenues are reflected in our consolidated statements of income for the post hurricane period  we have excluded the financial and statistical results for these facilities from our same facility results for the periods of september st through december st of and hurricane related expenses many of the hurricane related expenses and amount of insurance recoveries discussed below were based on our damage assessments of the real property and equipment at each of the above mentioned facilities affected by the hurricane 
however  given the wide spread damage to each facility and surrounding communities  at this time  we are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate amount of damage sustained by each facility  the ultimate replacement cost of the damaged assets or the net realizable value of the damaged assets 
therefore  it is 
table of contents likely that we will record additional charges in future periods related to hurricane katrina and our estimates of the charges may change by amounts which could be material

consists of the combined net book value of the damaged or destroyed depreciable assets at each facility based on our assessments of the real estate assets and equipment 
since the net book values of the damaged assets were not separately determinable  the write downs were determined using the estimated replacement cost of the damaged assets as compared to the total estimated replacement costs of all assets of each facility 
b 
the majority of the real estate assets of chalmette are leased by us from the trust and according to the terms of the lease in such circumstances  we have the obligation to i restore the property to substantially the same condition existing before the damage  ii offer to acquire the property in accordance with the terms of the lease  or  iii offer a substitution property equivalent in value to chalmette 
independent appraisals were obtained by us and the trust which indicated that the pre hurricane fair market value of the facility was million which is recorded in other accrued liabilities as of december  the existing lease on chalmette remains in place and rental income will continue for a period of time while we evaluate our options 
pursuant to the agreement  if we decide not to rebuild the facility  the trust will then decide whether to accept our offer to purchase the facility or substitute other property or to accept the insurance proceeds and terminate the existing lease on the facility 
we have been discussing with the trust the various alternatives available to the trust and us under the lease with chalmette including potentially fulfilling our chalmette lease obligation by offering the trust a substitute property or properties equivalent in value 
any arrangement will be subject to the approval of our board of directors and the independent trustees of the trust 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
c 
increase in provision for doubtful accounts was recorded to fully reserve for all accounts receivable outstanding for each facility since the hurricane has left many patients without the financial resources required to pay bills 
in addition  a provision was recorded to fully reserve for all net patient revenue that was unbilled at the time of the hurricane 
although we plan to submit bills for unbilled services if possible  many of the patient records containing the supporting documentation for services performed were damaged in the hurricane thereby making the billing and collection process extremely difficult 
d 
consists of asset impairment charges resulting from the hurricane to further reduce the carrying values of the depreciable real estate assets to their estimated net realizable values based on a projection of estimated future cash flows

g 
consists of various other expenses related to the hurricane and its aftermath including expenses incurred in connection with the patients  employees and property of each facility 
hurricane insurance recoveries included in our financial results during were hurricane related insurance recoveries of million reflecting the estimated minimum level of commercial insurance proceeds due to us 
as of december   we received million of these insurance proceeds and we received an additional million in early at the time of the hurricane  we maintained commercial insurance policies with a combined potential coverage of million for property damage and business interruption insurance 
due to the nature and extent of the overall damage to the area  neither we nor our commercial insurance adjusters have been able to complete a full assessment of the impacted facilities to determine the exact nature and extent of the losses 
although our insurance claims for hurricane related losses will exceed the recoveries we have recorded as of december   which we believe entitles us to hurricane related insurance proceeds in excess of those recorded as of december   the timing and amount of such proceeds can not be determined at this time since it will be based on factors such as loss causation  ultimate replacement costs of damaged assets and ultimate economic value of business interruption claims 
the million of after tax hurricane related insurance recoveries included in our financials results during was calculated as follows amount hurricane insurance recoveries less minority interests in hurricane insurance recoveries hurricane insurance recoveries before income taxes less provision for income taxes after tax hurricane insurance recoveries 
table of contents acute care hospital services year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the following table summarizes the results of operations for our acute care facilities on a same facility basis and is used in the discussions below for the years ended december  and dollar amounts in thousands year ended december  year ended december  acute care hospitals same facility basis amount of revenues amount of revenues net revenues operating charges salaries  wages and benefits other operating expenses supplies expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization lease and rental expense income before interest expense  minority interests and income taxes interest expense  net minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities income before income taxes on a same facility basis during  as compared to  net revenues at our acute care hospitals increased million or 
income before income taxes decreased million or to million or of net revenues during as compared to million or of net revenues during the factors contributing to the decrease in income before income taxes at these facilities are discussed below 
inpatient admissions to these facilities increased during  as compared to  while patient days increased 
the average length of patient stay at these facilities was days in each of the years and the occupancy rate  based on the average available beds at these facilities  was during  as compared to during our same facility net revenues were favorably impacted by an increase in prices charged to private payors including health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations 
on a same facility basis  net revenue per adjusted admission adjusted for outpatient activity at these facilities increased during  as compared to  and net revenue per adjusted patient day increased during  as compared to the large majority of the decline in income before income taxes at our acute care facilities during  as compared to  can be attributed to an increase in the level of uninsured patients at our acute care facilities and to a continued decline in the operating performance of our two acute care hospitals located in the mcallen edinburg market  as discussed below 
we have experienced an increase in uninsured patients throughout our portfolio of acute care hospitals which in part  has resulted from an increase in the number of patients who are employed but do not have health insurance 
the level of uninsured patients at our acute care facilities resulted in a significant increase in our provision for doubtful accounts which  on a same facility basis  increased to of net revenues during as compared to during during  combined admissions and patient days at our two acute care hospitals located in the mcallen edinburg  texas market decreased and  respectively  as compared to combined income before 
table of contents income taxes at these two facilities decreased million during  as compared to during  combined admissions and patient days at these two acute care hospitals decreased and  respectively  as compared to combined income before income taxes at these two facilities decreased million during  as compared to these declines were due primarily to continued intense hospital and physician competition 
a physician owned hospital in the market added new inpatient capacity in late which has further eroded a portion of our higher margin business  including cardiac procedures 
a continuation of increased provider competition in this market  as well as additional capacity under construction by us and others  could result in additional erosion of the net revenues and financial operating results of our acute care facilities in this market 
we expect the competitive pressures in the market to continue and potentially intensify if additional capacity is added to the market in future periods by our competitors 
as competition in the market has increased  wage rates and physician recruiting costs have risen increasing the continued pressure on operating margins and profitability 
in response to these competitive pressures  we have recruited a number of new physicians to the market  are working with many of our managed care plans for greater exclusivity and have undertaken significant capital investment in the market  including edinburg children s hospital  a new dedicated bed children s facility  which is scheduled to be completed and opened in the first quarter of  as well as south texas behavioral health center  a bed replacement behavioral facility  which is scheduled to be completed and opened during the second quarter of we cannot guarantee  however  that such investments will be successful in minimizing the impact of competition in this market 
during the past three years  the operating factors mentioned above have resulted in a certain degree of volatility in our income from continuing operations 
although we have undertaken actions in regards to physician recruitment and other measures as mentioned above in the mcallen edinburg market  the ultimate impact and timing of potential improvements in the operating results of the facilities in the market are beyond our ability to predict 
a continuation of the unfavorable operating results experienced in this market and or a continuation of the increased level of uninsured patients to our facilities and the resulting adverse trends in bad debt expense and charity care provided  could have a material unfavorable impact on our future operating results

hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels  the medical and ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients  the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or negotiated payment rates for such services 
charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient routine services vary depending on the type of services provided eg  medical surgical  intensive care or behavioral health and the geographic location of the hospital 
inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
the percentage of patient service revenue attributable to outpatient services has generally increased in recent years  primarily as a result of advances in medical technology that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis  as well as increased pressure from medicare  medicaid and private insurers to 
table of contents reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
we believe that our experience with respect to our increased outpatient levels mirrors the general trend occurring in the health care industry and we are unable to predict the rate of growth and resulting impact on our future revenues 
patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  some private insurance plans  and managed care plans  but are responsible for services not covered by such plans  exclusions  deductibles or co insurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles and co insurance has generally been increasing each year 
indications from recent federal and state legislation are that this trend will continue 
collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or business payers and we continue to experience an increase in uninsured and self pay patients which unfavorably impacts the collectibility of our patient accounts thereby increasing our provision for doubtful accounts and charity care provided 
the following table shows the approximate percentages of net patient revenue on a combined basis for our acute care and behavioral health facilities during the past three years excludes sources of revenues for all periods presented for divested facilities which reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
net patient revenue is defined as revenue from all sources after deducting contractual allowances and discounts from established billing rates  which we derived from various sources of payment for the years indicated

medicare medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons aged and over  some disabled persons and persons with end stage renal disease 
all of our acute care hospitals and many of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicare services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
amounts received under the medicare program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
under the medicare program  for inpatient services  our general acute care hospitals receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system pps 
under inpatient pps  hospitals are paid a predetermined fixed payment amount for each hospital discharge 
the fixed payment amount is based upon each patient s diagnosis related group drg 
every drg is assigned a payment rate based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis 
the drg payment rates are based upon historical national average costs and do not consider the actual costs incurred by a hospital in providing care 
this drg assignment also affects the predetermined capital rate paid with each drg 
the drg and capital payment rates are adjusted annually by the predetermined geographic adjustment factor for the geographic region in which a particular hospital is located and are weighted based upon a statistically normal distribution of severity 
drg rates are adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year  which begins on october the index used to adjust the drg rates  known as the hospital market basket index  gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services 
generally  however  the percentage increases in the drg payments have been lower than the projected increase in the cost of goods and services purchased by hospitals 
for federal fiscal years  and  the update factors were  and  respectively 
for  the update factor is 
hospitals are allowed to receive the full basket update if they provide the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms with specific data relating to the quality of services provided 
we have complied fully with this requirement and intend to comply fully in future periods 
for the majority of outpatient services  both general acute and behavioral health hospitals are paid under an outpatient pps according to ambulatory procedure codes apc that group together services that are clinically related and use similar resources 
depending on the service rendered during an encounter  a patient may be assigned to a single or multiple groups 
medicare pays a set price or rate for each group  regardless of the actual costs incurred in providing care 
medicare sets the payment rate for each apc based on historical median cost data  subject to geographic modification 
the apc payment rates are updated each federal fiscal year 
for  and  the payment rate update factors were  and  respectively 
for  the update factor is 
we operate inpatient rehabilitation hospital units that treat medicare patients with specific medical conditions which are excluded from the medicare pps drg payment methodology 
inpatient rehabilitation 
table of contents facilities irfs must meet a certain volume threshold each year for the number patients with these specific medical conditions  often referred to as the percent rule 
medicare payment for irf patients is based on a prospective case rate based on a cms determined case mix group classification and is updated annually by cms 
cms has temporarily reduced the irf qualifying threshold from to in  in and in before returning to the threshold in psychiatric hospitals have traditionally been excluded from the inpatient services pps 
however  on january   cms implemented a new pps psych pps for inpatient services furnished by psychiatric hospitals under the medicare program 
this system replaced the cost based reimbursement guidelines with a per diem pps with adjustments to account for certain facility and patient characteristics 
psych pps also contains provisions for outlier payments and an adjustment to a psychiatric hospital s base payment if it maintains a full service emergency department 
the new system is being phased in over a three year period 
also  cms has included a stop loss provision to ensure that hospitals avoid significant losses during the transition 
we believe the continued phase in of psych pps will have a favorable effect on our future results of operations  however  due to the three year phase in period  we do not believe the favorable effect will have a material impact on our results of operations 
medicaid medicaid is a joint federal state funded health care benefit program that is administered by the states to provide benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care 
most state medicaid payments are made under a pps like system  or under programs that negotiate payment levels with individual hospitals 
amounts received under the medicaid program are generally significantly less than a hospital s customary charges for services provided 
in addition to revenues received pursuant to the medicare program  we receive a large portion of our revenues either directly from medicaid programs or from managed care companies managing medicaid 
all of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers are certified as providers of medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities 
we receive a large concentration of our medicaid revenues from texas and significant amounts from pennsylvania  washington  dc and illinois 
we can provide no assurance that reductions to medicaid revenues  particularly in the above mentioned states  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
furthermore  the federal government and many states are currently working to effectuate significant reductions in the level of medicaid funding  which could adversely affect future levels of medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals 
in february  a texas medicaid state plan amendment went into effect that expands the supplemental inpatient reimbursement methodology for the state s medicaid program 
in and  we earned million and million  respectively  of revenue in connection with this program 
for the remainder of the state fiscal year covering the period of january  through august   our total supplemental payments pursuant to the provisions of this program are estimated to be approximately million 
in september  legislation in texas went into effect that ensures that some form of medicaid managed care will exist in every texas county 
in addition  the texas star plus program  which provides an integrated acute and long term care medicaid managed care delivery system to elderly and disabled medicaid beneficiaries in the harris county service area will be expanded to seven additional service areas 
such actions could have a material unfavorable impact on the reimbursement our texas hospitals receive 
also included in our financial results during was million in non recurring medicaid payments from texas for a sfy state wide upper payment limit upl medicaid payment program 
this upl program has not been renewed by texas for sfy the state of texas submitted to cms  an amendment to its medicaid state plan seeking approval to make supplemental payments to certain hospitals located in hidalgo  maverick and webb counties 
if approved  our four acute care hospital facilities located in these counties may be eligible to receive supplemental medicaid payments 
there can be no assurance these additional reimbursements will be approved  however  if approved  we may be entitled to additional reimbursements ranging from million to million covering the period of 
table of contents june  through august  if approved  the continuation of these reimbursements beyond august  and the level of such reimbursements are largely contingent on the nature of cms s disposition of the state plan amendment 
in  the texas health and human services commission commission implemented rules that offset negative medicaid shortfalls in the hospital specific cap formula  and included third party and upper payment limit payments in the shortfall calculation 
these changes have resulted in reduced payments to our hospitals located in texas that have significant medicaid populations 
managed care a significant portion of our net patient revenues are generated from managed care companies  which include health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and managed medicare and medicaid programs referred to as medicare part c or medicare advantage 
in general  we expect the percentage of our business from managed care programs to continue to grow 
the consequent growth in managed care networks and the resulting impact of these networks on the operating results of our facilities vary among the markets in which we operate 
typically  we receive lower payments per patient from managed care payors than we do from traditional indemnity insurers  however  during the past few years we have secured price increases from many of our commercial payors including managed care companies 
commercial insurance our hospitals also provide services to individuals covered by private health care insurance 
private insurance carriers typically make direct payments to hospitals or  in some cases  reimburse their policy holders  based upon the particular hospital s established charges and the particular coverage provided in the insurance policy 
private insurance reimbursement varies among payors and states and is generally based on contracts negotiated between the hospital and the payor 
commercial insurers are continuing efforts to limit the payments for hospital services by adopting discounted payment mechanisms  including predetermined payment or drg based payment systems  for more inpatient and outpatient services 
to the extent that such efforts are successful and reduce the insurers reimbursement to hospitals and the costs of providing services to their beneficiaries  such reduced levels of reimbursement may have a negative impact on the operating results of our hospitals 
other sources our hospitals provide services to individuals that do not have any form of health care coverage 
such patients are evaluated  at the time of service or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based upon federal and state poverty guidelines  qualifications for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as our local hospital s indigent and charity care policy 
patients without health care coverage who do not qualify for medicaid or indigent care write offs are offered substantial discounts in an effort to settle their outstanding account balances 
in addition  effective january   we implemented a formal uninsured discount policy for our acute care hospitals which will have the effect of lowering both our provision for doubtful accounts and net revenues but should not materially impact net income 
state medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments hospitals that have an unusually large number of low income patients ie  those with a medicaid utilization rate of at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid utilization  or having a low income patient utilization rate exceeding are eligible to receive a disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustment 
congress established a national limit on dsh adjustments 
although this legislation and the resulting state broad based provider taxes have affected the payments we receive under the medicaid program  to date the net impact has not been materially adverse 
upon meeting certain conditions  and serving a disproportionately high share of texas and south carolina s low income patients  five of our facilities located in texas and one facility located in south carolina received additional reimbursement from each state s dsh fund 
the texas and south carolina programs have been renewed for each state s fiscal years covering the period of september  through august  for texas and july  through june  for south carolina 
although neither state has definitively quantified the amount of dsh funding our facilities will receive during the fiscal years  both 
table of contents states have indicated the allocation criteria will be similar to the methodology used in previous years 
included in our financial results was an aggregate of million during  million during and million during from these programs 
failure to renew these dsh programs beyond their scheduled termination dates  failure of our hospitals that currently receive dsh payments to qualify for future dsh funds under these programs  or reductions in reimbursements  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
in february  the united states department of health and human services hhs office of inspector general oig published a report indicating that texas medicaid may have overpaid texas hospitals for dsh payments 
to date  no actions to follow up on this report have had any material impact on our texas hospitals 
sources of revenues and health care reform given increasing budget deficits  the federal government and many states are currently considering additional ways to limit increases in levels of medicare and medicaid funding  which could also adversely affect future payments received by our hospitals 
in addition  the uncertainty and fiscal pressures placed upon the federal government as a result of  among other things  the ongoing military engagement in iraq  the war on terrorism  economic recovery stimulus packages  responses to natural disasters  such as hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  the continuing expansion of a medicare drug benefit and the federal budget deficit in general may affect the availability of federal funds to provide additional relief in the future 
we are unable to predict the effect of future policy changes on our operations 
in addition to statutory and regulatory changes to the medicare and each of the state medicaid programs  our operations and reimbursement may be affected by administrative rulings  new or novel interpretations and determinations of existing laws and regulations  post payment audits  requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to our facilities 
the final determination of amounts we receive under the medicare and medicaid programs often takes many years  because of audits by the program representatives  providers rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical reimbursement provisions 
we believe that we have made adequate provisions for such potential adjustments 
nevertheless  until final adjustments are made  certain issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or more than ultimately required 
finally  we expect continued third party efforts to aggressively manage reimbursement levels and cost controls 
reductions in reimbursement amounts received from third party payors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations other operating results combined net revenues from our surgical hospitals  ambulatory surgery centers and radiation oncology centers were million during  million during and million during combined income before income taxes from these entities was million during  million during and million during interest expense was million during  million during and million during the million decrease during  as compared to  was due primarily to lower borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility since during  we repaid million of debt under the facility net of million of additional borrowings using the net cash provided by operating activities and the cash proceeds generated from the sale of assets and businesses consisting primarily of the sale of acute care hospitals  as discussed below in discontinued operations

professional and general liability claims and property insurance due to unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional and general liability insurance markets  our subsidiaries have assumed a greater portion of the hospital professional and general liability risk as the cost of commercial professional and general liability insurance coverage has risen significantly 
as a result  effective january   most of our subsidiaries were self insured for malpractice exposure up to million per occurrence 
we purchased an umbrella excess policy for our subsidiaries through a commercial insurance carrier for coverage in excess of million per occurrence with a million aggregate limitation 
given these insurance market conditions  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends  or a sharp increase in claims asserted against us  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
our estimated liability for professional and general liability claims is based on a number of factors including  among other things  the number of asserted claims and reported incidents  estimates of losses for these claims based on recent and historical settlement amounts  estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience  and estimates of amounts recoverable under our commercial insurance policies 
while we continuously monitor these factors  our ultimate liability for professional and general liability claims could change materially from our current estimates due to inherent uncertainties involved in making this estimate 
for the period from january  through december   most of our subsidiaries were covered under commercial insurance policies with phico  a pennsylvania based insurance company that was placed into liquidation during the first quarter of as a result of phico s liquidation  we recorded a million pre tax charge during to reserve for phico claims that became our liability 
however  we continue to be entitled to receive reimbursement from state insurance guaranty funds and or phico s estate for a portion of certain claims ultimately paid by us 
during the third quarter of  we received an million cash settlement from a 
table of contents commercial professional and general liability insurance carrier related to payment of phico related claims 
this settlement was recorded as a reduction of expected recoveries 
as of december   the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was million million net of expected recoveries  of which million is included in other current liabilities 
as of december   the total accrual for our professional and general liability claims was million million net of expected recoveries  of which million is included in other current liabilities 
included in other assets was million as of december  and million as of december   related to estimated expected recoveries from various state guaranty funds  insurance companies and other sources in connection with phico related professional and general liability claims payments 
during  and  we had commercial insurance policies for a large portion of our property loss exposure which provided coverage with varying sub limits and aggregates for property and business interruption losses resulting from damage sustained from fire  flood  windstorm and earthquake 
the specific amount of commercial insurance coverage was dependent on factors such as location of the facility and loss causation 
due to a sharp increase in property losses experienced nationwide in recent years  we expect the cost of commercial property insurance to rise significantly 
as a result  catastrophic coverage for flood  earthquake and windstorm may be limited to annual aggregate losses as opposed to per occurrence losses and coverage may be limited to lower sub limits for named windstorms  earthquakes in certain states such as alaska  california  puerto rico and washington and for floods in facilities located in designated flood zones 
given these insurance market conditions  there can be no assurance that a continuation of these unfavorable trends  or a sharp increase in uninsured property losses sustained by us  will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
effects of inflation and seasonality seasonality our business is typically seasonal  with higher patient volumes and net patient service revenue in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
this seasonality occurs because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which results in significant increases in the number of patients treated in our hospitals during those months 
inflation although inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations over the last three years  the healthcare industry is very labor intensive and salaries and benefits are subject to inflationary pressures as are rising supply costs which tend to escalate as vendors pass on the rising costs through price increases 
our acute care and behavioral health care facilities are experiencing the effects of a shortage of skilled nursing staff nationwide  which has caused and may continue to cause an increase in salaries  wages and benefits expense in excess of the inflation rate 
although we cannot predict our ability to continue to cover future cost increases  we believe that through adherence to cost containment policies  labor management and reasonable price increases  the effects of inflation on future operating margins should be manageable 
however  our ability to pass on these increased costs associated with providing healthcare to medicare and medicaid patients is limited due to various federal  state and local laws which have been enacted that  in certain cases  limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and a continuing industry wide shift of patients into managed care plans  our ability to maintain margins through price increases to non medicare patients is limited
