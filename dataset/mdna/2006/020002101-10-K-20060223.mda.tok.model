reserve for property liability claims and claims expense the following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property liability operations  encompassing both the allstate protection segment and the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
reconciliation of claims reserves the following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves  displayed individually for each of the last three years 
the first table presents reserves on a gross before reinsurance basis 
the end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the second table presents reserves on a net after reinsurance basis 
the total net property liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations

the year end gross reserves of billion for property liability insurance claims and claims expense  as determined under gaap  were billion more than the net reserve balance of billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities 
the principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for gaap reporting  and a liability for the reserves of the canadian subsidiaries for million 
remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between gaap and statutory reporting 
as the tables above illustrate  allstate s net reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of decreased in by million  compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of a decrease of million 
net reserve reestimates in  and were lower than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance cessions 
loss reserve reestimates the following loss reserve reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years 
the first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year 
the second section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability 
the third section  reading down  shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of allstate s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established  and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims 
the table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period  with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable 
the loss reserve reestimates table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years

the decreases in net reserves established as of december  and december  reflects favorable reestimates as more fully discussed below 
the following table is derived from the loss reserve reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations for the ten year period ended december  the total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year s 
effect of net reserve reestimates on calendar year operations in millions total by accident year prior total favorable calendar year reserve reestimates in through were the result of favorable severity trends in each of the five years for allstate protection  which more than offset adverse reestimates in the discontinued lines and coverages segment  primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities  virtually all of which relates to and prior years 
the favorable severity trend during this period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends  as compared to our anticipated trends 
favorable injury severity trends were largely due to more moderate medical cost inflation and the mitigating effects of our loss management programs 
the impacts of more moderate medical cost inflation have emerged over time as actual claim settlements validate its magnitude 
beginning in the early s  lower medical cost inflation rates  as evidenced by the consumer price index cpi published by the bureau of labor statistics for medical costs  have contributed to lower actual claim settlements than prior estimates 
from through  the medical cpi averaged  and from through  the average declined to 
the medical cpi is considered a viable indicator of the direction of claim costs because it is a measure of the change in various costs for medical services and supplies  including doctors fees  emergency care  therapy and rehabilitation  and pharmaceuticals  all of which are covered claims for insureds 
in  the medical cpi was  and most recent economic forecasts anticipate future increases in medical inflation 
if this occurs  future reserve reestimates could be adversely impacted if actual results exceed reserve estimates 
our loss management programs over time have had a mitigating effect in a variety of aspects on injury severity trends 
we have been improving the claim adjudication processes by implementing programs to accomplish better investigation of claims  consistent handling of soft tissue injury claims  more accurate valuation of damages  and more effective negotiation and defense practices 
these improvements have also involved hiring additional staff  providing increased training  creating specialized units of expert employees to handle specific types of claims  and focusing attention and resources on handling specific types of claims such as soft tissue injury claims  claims with attorney involvement  and claims in litigation 
these programs were intended to create an improved culture  focused on expert  efficient  and effective claim process management 
since  growth of allstate s injury claim costs has compared favorably to published insurance industry competitor results 
we believe this experience is substantially due to the claim adjudication process improvements  and is an additional factor contributing to reductions in reserve estimates 
while changes to the claim settlement process have mitigated increases in severity trends on closed claims  these changes can impact historical patterns of losses  introducing a greater degree of statistical variability in actuarial reserve estimates for the remaining outstanding claims 
in and  we decreased our reserve estimates for prior years 
favorable reserve estimates were primarily due to allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates 
decreased reserve reestimates for allstate protection more than offset increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in and  we increased our reserve estimates for prior years 
unfavorable reserve reestimates in  were due to favorable allstate protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates  offset by unfavorable increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines 
unfavorable reserve reestimates in were due to claim severity and late reported losses for allstate protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the discontinued lines and coverages segment 
in  we increased our reserve estimates for prior years due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year which were reported in the year  additional incurred losses on the northridge earthquake  adverse results of class action and other litigation  upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of losses in the encompass and canadian businesses

regulation allstate is subject to extensive regulation  primarily at the state level 
the method  extent and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory agency 
in general  such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries  not the holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
these rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters including insurance company licensing and examination  agent and adjuster licensing  price setting  trade practices  policy forms  accounting methods  the nature and amount of investments  claims practices  participation in shared markets and guaranty funds  reserve adequacy  insurer solvency  transactions with affiliates  the payment of dividends  and underwriting standards 
some of these matters are discussed in more detail below 
for a discussion of statutory financial information  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of regulatory contingencies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
notes and are incorporated in this part i  item by reference 
in recent years the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny 
legislation that would provide for federal chartering of insurance companies has been proposed 
in addition  state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation 
we cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on allstate 
agent and broker compensation 
in  several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies 
the proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers 
as of the end of the year  new disclosure requirements have been imposed in certain circumstances upon some agents and brokers in several states  including texas 
limitations on dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no significant business operations of its own  the allstate corporation relies on dividends from allstate insurance company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations  including the payment of principal and interest on debt 
allstate insurance company is regulated as an insurance company in illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by illinois law 
for additional information regarding those restrictions  see part ii  item of this report 
the laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive 
holding company regulation 
the allstate corporation and allstate insurance company are insurance holding companies subject to regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business 
in the us  these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of florida  illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  pennsylvania and texas 
generally  the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of control of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership  control  possession with the power to vote  or possession of proxies with respect to  ten percent or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer 
in addition  certain state insurance laws require pre acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state 
while such pre acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control  such statutes do authorize certain remedies  including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non domestic insurer if certain conditions exist  such as undue market concentration 
thus  any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of the allstate corporation s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in illinois  massachusetts  nebraska  new hampshire  new york  pennsylvania and texas 
the prior approval of the florida insurance department would be necessary for the acquisition of five percent or more 
moreover  notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business 
such approval requirements may deter  delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of the allstate corporation s common stock 
price regulation 
nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules  policy or coverage forms  and other information with the state s regulatory authority 
in many cases  such price schedules  policy forms or both must be approved prior to use 
while they vary from state to state  the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same a price cannot be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends  in part  on whether the pricing laws are i prior approval  ii file and use  or iii use and file laws 
in states having prior approval laws  the regulator must approve a price before the insurer may use it 
in states having file and use laws  the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator s approval to use a price  but the price must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used 
a use and file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them 
approximately one half of the states  including california and new york  have prior approval laws 
under all three types of pricing laws  the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing 
an insurer s ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite  an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance 
in those states that significantly restrict an insurer s ability to charge a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance  the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites 
when a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing  it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability 
changes in allstate s claim settlement process may require allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process 
some state insurance regulatory authorities may not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators and special interest groups to reduce  freeze or set prices at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses 
homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure  particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
we expect this kind of pressure to persist 
in addition  our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators  legislators and special interest groups in various states 
the result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the allstate protection segment 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing 
involuntary markets 
as a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states  we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
underwriting results related to these arrangements  which tend to be adverse  have been immaterial to our results of operations 
guaranty funds 
under state insurance guaranty fund laws  insurers doing business in a state can be assessed  up to prescribed limits  in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies 
national flood insurance program 
we voluntarily participate as a write your own wyo carrier in the national flood insurance program nfip 
the nfip is administered and regulated by the federal emergency management agency fema 
we operate as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the selling and administering of the standard flood insurance policy sfip 
this involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the united states treasury 
we receive expense allowances from nfip for underwriting administration  claims management  commission and adjuster fees 
investment regulation 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories 
failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non conforming investments as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus 
further  in some instances  these rules require divestiture of non conforming investments 
as of december  the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries complied with such laws and regulations in all material respects 
exiting geographic markets  canceling and non renewing policies 
most states regulate an insurer s ability to exit a market 
for example  states limit  to varying degrees  an insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
regulations that limit cancellation and non renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer s ability to exit unprofitable markets 
variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities 
the sale of variable life insurance  variable annuities and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level  including regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission and the national association of securities dealers 
broker dealers  investment advisors and investment companies 
the allstate entities that operate as broker dealers  registered investment advisors and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the securities and exchange commission  the national association of securities dealers and or  in some cases  state securities administrators 
regulation and legislation affecting consolidation in the financial services industry 
the gramm leach bliley act of permits mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms within one holding company group 
in addition  it allows grandfathered unitary thrift holding companies  including our parent company  to engage in activities that are not financial in nature 
the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may materially adversely affect our business by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
banking 
the allstate corporation is a diversified savings and loan holding company for allstate bank  a federal stock savings bank and a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the principal supervisory authority for the diversified savings and loan holding company activities and the bank is the office of thrift supervision 
the bank is also subject to the authority of the fdic and other federal financial regulators implementing various laws applicable to banking 
privacy regulation 
federal law and the laws of some states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
federal law and the laws of some states also regulate disclosures of customer information 
congress  state legislatures and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information 
asbestos 
president bush has indicated support for efforts to pass meaningful federal reform to address asbestos claims and litigation 
congress has considered such legislation in the past  but unified support among various defendant and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking 
in february  there was a renewed effort to bring such measures before the senate 
we cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos 
environmental 
environmental pollution clean up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfund govern the clean up and restoration of waste sites by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds environmental clean up laws or ecls establish a mechanism to assign liability to prps or to fund the clean up of waste sites if prps fail to do so 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent on a variety of factors 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean up  but the exact number is unknown 
the extent of clean up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean up of waste sites by insured prps and the insured parties alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean up 
the insurance industry  including allstate  has disputed and is disputing many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether superfund response  investigation and clean up costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions  proper notice of claims  whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend  appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers  and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an occurrence 
identical coverage issues exist for clean up and waste sites not covered under superfund 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
allstate s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been  or may be  named as prps is uncertain 
while comprehensive superfund reform proposals have been introduced in congress  only modest reform measures have been enacted

we use operating ratios to measure the profitability of our property liability results 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses  expense ratio the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned  combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting loss income as a percentage of premiums earned

it is reasonably likely that changes in these assumptions and estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a brief summary of each of these critical accounting policies follows 
for a more detailed discussion of the effect of these policies on our consolidated financial statements  and the judgments and estimates related to these policies  see the referenced sections of the md a 
for a complete summary of our significant accounting policies see note of the consolidated financial statements 
investment valuation the fair value of publicly traded fixed income and equity securities is based on independent market quotations  whereas the fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models  which use internally developed ratings and independent third party data as inputs  or independent third party pricing sources 
factors used in our internally developed models  such as liquidity risk associated with privately placed securities  are difficult to independently observe and quantify 
because of this  judgment is required in developing certain of these estimates and  as a result  the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities may differ from amounts that would be realized upon an immediate sale of the securities 
for investments classified as available for sale  the difference between fair value and amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities  net of deferred income taxes  is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of financial position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when declines in fair values are deemed other than temporary 
the assessment of other than temporary impairment of a security s fair value is performed on a portfolio review as well as a case by case basis considering a wide range of factors 
for our portfolio review evaluations  we ascertain whether there are any approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration  revision to strategic asset allocations and liquidity actions  and any dispositions planned by the portfolio managers 
in these instances  we recognize impairment on securities being considered for these approved planned actions if the security is in an unrealized loss position 
there are a number of assumptions and estimates inherent in evaluating impairments and determining if they are other than temporary  including our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the expected recoverability of principal and interest  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities or amortized cost for fixed income securities  the financial condition  near term and long term prospects of the issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions which could affect liquidity 
additionally  once assumptions and estimates are made  any number of changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to later determine that an impairment is other than temporary  including general economic conditions that are worse than previously assumed or that have a greater adverse effect on a particular issuer than originally estimated  changes in the facts and circumstances related to a particular issuer s ability to meet all of its contractual obligations  and changes in facts and circumstances or new information obtained which causes a change in our ability or intent to hold a security to maturity or until it recovers in value 
changes in assumptions  facts and circumstances could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods to the extent that losses are realized 
the charge to earnings  while potentially significant to net income  would not have a significant effect on shareholders equity since the majority of our portfolio is carried at fair value and as a result  any related unrealized loss  net of deferred acquisition costs  deferred sales inducement costs and related deferred tax  would already be reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
for a more detailed discussion of the risks relating to changes in investment values and levels of investment impairment  and the potential causes of such changes  see note of the consolidated financial statements and the investments  market risk  enterprise risk management and forward looking statements and risk factors sections of the md a 
derivative instrument hedge effectiveness we primarily use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risk and in conjunction with asset liability management  particularly in the allstate financial segment 
the fair value of exchange traded derivative contracts is based on independent market quotations  whereas the fair value of non exchange traded derivative contracts is based on either widely accepted pricing valuation models which use independent third party data as inputs or independent third party pricing sources 
when derivatives meet specific criteria  they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value  cash flow  foreign currency fair value  or foreign currency cash flow hedges 
when designating a derivative as an accounting hedge  we formally document the hedging relationship  risk management objective and strategy 
the documentation identifies the hedging instrument  the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and the assumptions used to assess how effective the hedging instrument is in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item s fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
in the case of a cash flow hedge  this documentation includes the exposure to changes in the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk 
we do not exclude any component of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument from the effectiveness assessment 
at each reporting date  we confirm that the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective in offsetting the hedged risk

deferred policy acquisition cost dac amortization we incur significant costs in connection with acquiring business 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring business are deferred and recorded as an asset on the consolidated statements of financial position 
dac related to property liability contracts is amortized to income as premiums are earned  typically over periods of six to twelve months 
the amortization methodology for dac for allstate financial policies and contracts includes significant assumptions and estimates 
dac related to traditional life insurance is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business 
significant assumptions relating to estimated premiums  investment income and realized capital gains and losses  as well as to all other aspects of dac are determined based upon conditions as of the date of policy issuance and are generally not revised during the life of the policy 
any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies change the rate of amortization in the period such events occur 
generally  the amortization period for these contracts approximate the estimated lives of the policies 
dac related to interest sensitive life  fixed and variable annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits which includes both actual historical gross profits agp and estimated future gross profits egp earned over the estimated lives of the contracts 
the amortization periods range from years  however  estimates of customer surrender rates  partial withdrawals and deaths generally result in the majority of the dac being amortized over the surrender charge period 
agp and egp consist of the following components benefit margins primarily from mortality  including guaranteed minimum death  income  withdrawal and accumulation benefits  investment margin including realized capital gains and losses  and contract administration  surrender and other contract charges  less maintenance expenses 
dac amortization for variable annuity and life contracts is estimated using stochastic modeling and is significantly impacted by the anticipated return on the underlying funds 
our long term assumption of separate accounts fund performance  net of fees  was approximately in and in and whenever actual separate accounts fund performance  based on the two most recent years  varies from the expectation  we project performance levels over the next five years such that the mean return over a seven year period equals the long term expectation 
this process is referred to as reversion to the mean and is commonly used by the life insurance industry 
although the use of a reversion to the mean assumption is common within the industry  the parameters used in the methodology are subject to judgment and vary between companies 
for example  when applying this assumption we do not allow the future mean rates of return including fees projected over the five year period to exceed or fall below 
we periodically evaluate the results of utilizing this process to confirm that it is reasonably possible that variable annuity and life fund performance will revert to the expected long term mean within this time horizon 
revisions to egps result in changes in the cumulative amounts expensed as a component of amortization of dac in the period in which the revision is made 
this is commonly known as dac unlocking

reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense estimation the property liability underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported ibnr  as of the reporting date 
allstate protection reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix and contractual terms  law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
the effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process 
since reserves are estimates of the unpaid portions of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the highest degree of uncertainty is associated with reserves for losses incurred in the current accident year as it contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date 
that proportion diminishes in subsequent years 
we believe our net loss reserves are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws and regulations 
we calculate and record a single best reserve estimate  in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards  for each line of insurance  its components coverages and perils  and state  for reported losses and for ibnr losses and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount 
due to the uncertainties involved  the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts  which are based on our best estimates 
accordingly  we believe that it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such changes in losses incurred 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims 
changes in prior year reserve estimates  which may be material  are reported in property liability insurance claims and claims expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period such changes are determined 
the aggregation of these estimates forms the reserve liability recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position 
based on our products and coverages  historical experience and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates  we estimate that the potential variability of our allstate protection reserves  excluding the unprecedented hurricane losses experienced in which we expect will be paid during  within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes  may be approximately plus or minus  or plus or minus million in net income 
although this evaluation reflects the most likely outcomes  it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts 
establishing discontinued lines and coverages net loss reserves for asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of claims 
among the complications are lack of historical data  long reporting delays  uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage  unresolved legal issues regarding the determination  availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits  plaintiffs evolving and expanding theories of liability  availability and collectibility of recoveries from reinsurance  retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements  and estimating the extent and timing of any contractual liability  and other uncertainties 
there are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered  or were ever intended to be covered  and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are determined  how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted  and whether clean up costs represent insured property damage 
we believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future  and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves 
management believes its net loss reserves for environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures are appropriately established based on available facts  technology  laws and regulations 
due to the uncertainties and factors described above  management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required

reserve for life contingent contract benefits estimation long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses are used when establishing the reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
these assumptions  which for traditional life insurance are applied using the net level premium method  include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by such characteristics as type of coverage  year of issue and policy duration 
future investment yield assumptions are determined at the time the policy is issued based upon prevailing investment yields as well as estimated reinvestment yields 
mortality  morbidity and policy termination assumptions are based on our experience and industry experience prevailing at the time the policies are issued 
expense assumptions include the estimated effects of inflation and expenses to be incurred beyond the premium paying period

property liability operations overview our property liability operations consist of two business segments allstate protection and discontinued lines and coverages 
allstate protection is comprised of two brands  the allstate brand and encompass brand 
allstate protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance  primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance  to individuals in the united states and canada 
discontinued lines and coverages includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
these segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources 
underwriting loss income  a measure that is not based on gaap and is reconciled to net income on page  is calculated as premiums earned  less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges  as determined using gaap 
we use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the property liability insurance operations separately from investment results 
it is also an integral component of incentive compensation 
it is useful for investors to evaluate the components of income separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
underwriting loss income should not be considered as a substitute for net income and does not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure 
the table below includes gaap operating ratios we use to measure our profitability 
we believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability 
they are calculated as follows claims and claims expense loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses 
expense ratio the ratio of amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense  amortization of dac  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the difference between and the combined ratio represents underwriting loss income as a percentage of premiums earned 
we have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the gaap operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods 
effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expenses to premiums earned 
effect of pretax reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of pretax reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned 
effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned 
effect of discontinued lines and coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and other costs and expenses in the discontinued lines and coverages segment to property liability premiums earned 
the sum of the effect of discontinued lines and coverages on the combined ratio and the allstate protection combined ratio on page is equal to the property liability combined ratio

the encompass brand includes standard auto and homeowners products while the deerbrook brand is used for non standard auto products 
the key elements of the allstate protection strategy are investing in marketing and brand awareness improving customer experience expanding distribution utilizing sophisticated pricing and underwriting discipline developing innovative and differentiated products leveraging claims capabilities we are seeking  through the utilization of our distribution channels  our sophisticated risk segmentation process tiered pricing and consumer marketing  to attract and retain high lifetime value customers who will potentially provide favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationship with us 
we maintain a broad marketing approach throughout the us we have aligned agency and management compensation and the overall strategies of the allstate brand to best serve our customers by basing certain incentives on allstate brand profitability  unit growth  retention  and sales of allstate financial products 
we differentiate the allstate brand from competitors through new innovative products such as allstate your choice auto 
we continue to enhance technology to integrate our distribution channels  improve customer service  facilitate the introduction of new products and services and reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims 
these actions and others are designed to optimize the effectiveness of our distribution and service channels by increasing the productivity of the allstate brand s exclusive agencies and the good hands network 
tiered pricing and underwriting are designed to enhance both our competitive position and profit potential  and produce a broader range of premiums that is more refined than the range generated by the standard non standard model 
tiered pricing includes our strategic risk management srm program  which uses a number of risk evaluation factors including  to the extent legally permissible  insurance scoring based on information that is obtained from credit reports 
we continue to expand the number of tiers with successive rating program releases 
as we continue to use tiered pricing  there is a diminishing capacity to draw meaningful comparisons to historical presentations  including the distinctions between standard and non standard which have become less relevant in certain states 
for this reason  we believe it is useful for investors to analyze auto results that aggregate our standard and non standard business 
generally  standard auto customers are expected to have lower risks of loss than non standard auto customers 
substantially all of new and approximately of renewal business written for allstate brand auto uses tiered pricing  an increase from in when computed on a comparable basis 
for allstate brand homeowners  approximately of new and of renewal business written uses tiered pricing 
for allstate brand auto and homeowners business written under tiered pricing  our results indicate an increase in retention and a shift toward more customers who we consider high lifetime value and who generate more favorable loss results 
our strategy for the encompass brand focuses on those markets that give us the best opportunity to grow profitably  in part by using tiered pricing 
the integration of encompass policies onto allstate systems has resulted in a different counting process for pif 
as a result  percent changes in pif  average premium and the renewal ratio are subject to some distortion 
we are continuing our efforts to seek approval for rate changes for all allstate protection products in all jurisdictions where we believe such changes are needed and can be obtained based on rate indicators  such as our projected claim frequency and severity experience and expense levels including cost of reinsurance coverage purchased and catastrophe losses  and to pursue other actions affecting our profitability such as improving our underwriting and claims processes 
an important element of our strategy is to manage our property catastrophe exposure to enable our shareholders to earn an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings  while providing quality protection to our customers 
although in many areas of the country we are currently achieving returns within acceptable risk tolerances  we continue to seek solutions to improve returns in areas that have known exposure to hurricanes  earthquakes and other catastrophes 
we will significantly reduce our catastrophe exposure over time while working to mitigate the impact of our actions on customers 
we are also working for changes in the regulatory environment  including fewer restrictions on underwriting  recognizing the need for and improving appropriate risk based pricing and promoting the creation of government sponsored  privately funded solutions 
our property business includes personal homeowners  commercial property and other property lines 
pricing of property products is typically intended to establish returns that we deem acceptable over a long term period 
losses  including losses from catastrophic events and weather related losses such as wind  hail  lightning and freeze losses not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe are accrued on an occurrence basis within the policy period 
therefore  in any reporting period  loss experience from catastrophic events and weather related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations we incorporated into the products pricing 
accordingly  property products are more capital intensive than other personal lines products 
actions we are taking and evaluating to attain an acceptable catastrophe exposure level in our personal and commercial property businesses include additional purchases of reinsurance  increased participation in various state facilities such as wind pools  changes in rates  deductibles and coverage  limitations on new business writings  changes to underwriting requirements  non renewal  discontinuing coverage for certain types of residences  withdrawal from certain markets  and or pursuing alternative markets for placement of business or segments of risk exposure in certain areas 
while actions taken will be primarily focused on reducing the catastrophe exposure in our personal and commercial property businesses  we also consider their impact on our ability to market our auto lines when evaluating the feasibility of their implementation 
in order to assess and monitor our actions  we are considering and adopting new performance measurements for managing our property business 
these measurements currently include exposure limits based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis  acceptable targeted rates of return by line and by state and potential exposure to capital impairment 
as part of our catastrophe management efforts  we are involved with a newly created coalition called protectingamerica 
org 
the coalition is dedicated to raising awareness  educating the public and policymakers  and offering solutions that will better prepare and protect consumers  taxpayers and the american economy from major catastrophes in a sensible  cost effective fashion 
a comprehensive solution is being advanced that includes the development of government sponsored  privately funded catastrophe funds at the state and national levels  improved prevention and mitigation measures  including the adoption of more effective land use policies and stronger building codes  enhanced public education about catastrophe risk  better catastrophe relief  recovery and rebuilding processes  and a rigorous process of continuous improvement for catastrophe preparedness and response programs and processes 
premiums written  an operating measure  is the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period 
premiums earned is a gaap measure 
premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period 
the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position 
since the allstate brand policy periods are typically months for auto and months for homeowners  encompass auto and homeowners policy periods are typically months and deerbrook auto policy periods are typically months  rate changes taken during and will generally be recognized in premiums earned over a period of to months 
during this period  premiums written at a higher rate will cause an increase in the balance of unearned premiums on our consolidated statements of financial position

the increase in allstate brand standard auto pif as of december  as compared to december  is the result of new business 
the increase in the allstate brand standard auto average premium in compared to is primarily due to higher average new and renewal premiums primarily due to a shift by policyholders to newer and more expensive autos and  to a lesser extent  rate actions

allstate brand standard auto new business premiums written increased in when compared to the increase in allstate brand standard auto pif in compared to is primarily the result of increases in new business due to the implementation of a broader marketing approach in most of the us and an increased renewal ratio  which management believes was related to reduced rate activity and improved customer loyalty

for a further discussion of catastrophe losses  see page changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy 
we mitigate these effects through various loss management programs 
injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices 
our rate of increase in incurred injury claim severity during and was lower than the relevant medical cost indices 
for auto physical damage coverages  we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against a weighted average of the maintenance and repair price index and the parts equipment price index 
in and  our rate of increase in incurred physical damage current year claim severity was generally lower than the weighted index 
we believe our claim settlement initiatives  such as improvements to the claim settlement process  medical management programs  the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims  litigation management and defense strategies  as well as various loss management initiatives underway  contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends 
changes in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials  the cost of construction and property repair services  the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents  the types of claims that qualify for coverage  deductibles and other economic and environmental factors 
in and  we experienced an increase in homeowners severity compared to prior year 
we employ various loss management programs to mitigate the effect of these factors  however  homeowners severity may increase 
we have also taken numerous actions that we expect to contribute to profitable trends in the homeowners loss ratio

homeowners loss ratio increased points for the allstate brand and declined points for the encompass brand in when compared to these fluctuations were due to higher catastrophes partially offset by higher premiums earned  favorable reserve reestimates related to prior years and lower claim frequency  excluding catastrophes for the allstate brand  and higher current year claim severity 
expense ratio for allstate protection decreased points in when compared to primarily due to a reduction in employee incentives due to lower financial results for in  the ratio increased due to higher amortization of dac resulting from higher agent incentives and increases in marketing expense 
the impact of specific costs and expenses on the expense ratio is included in the following table

the encompass brand expense ratio is higher on average than the expense ratio of the allstate brand due to higher commission rates and licensing fees paid to cna financial corporation  which ended in the fourth quarter of the licensing fees were of premiums written by independent agencies appointed by cna for a period of six years after acquisition of the cna personal lines business encompass in allstate protection underwriting income was impacted by restructuring charges

we define a catastrophe as an event that produces pretax losses before reinsurance in excess of million and involves multiple first party policyholders  or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset  per event threshold of average claims in a specific area  occurring within a certain amount of time following the event 
catastrophes are caused by various natural events including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hailstorms  hurricanes  tropical storms  high winds and winter storms 
we are also exposed to human made catastrophic events  such as certain acts of terrorism or industrial accidents 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted 
historical catastrophe experience since the beginning of  the average annual impact of catastrophes on our property liability loss ratio was points 
however  this average does not reflect the impact of some of the more significant actions we have taken to limit our catastrophe exposure 
consequently  we think it is useful to consider the impact of catastrophes after excluding losses that are now partially or substantially covered by the california earthquake authority cea  fhcf or placed with a third party  such as hurricane coverage in hawaii 
the average annual impact of all catastrophes  excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki and losses from california earthquakes  on our property liability loss ratio was points since the beginning of comparatively  the average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the years through is shown in the following table 
average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio excluding losses from hurricanes andrew and iniki  and losses from california earthquakes eastern and gulf coast states all other total over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes 
limitations include our participation in various state facilities  such as the cea  which provides insurance for california earthquake losses  the fhcf  which provides reimbursements on certain qualifying florida hurricane losses  and other state facilities  such as wind pools 
however  the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values  the effect of state insurance laws and regulations and by the effect of competitive considerations 
in addition  in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers 
because of our participation  we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and or to assessments from these facilities 
hurricanes we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes to generally be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the united states 
policies in force attributable to counties along the eastern and gulf coasts  including the entire state of florida  represented approximately of total homeowners policies in force during generally  the average premium on a property policy near these coasts is greater than other areas 
examples of actions taken in and early to reduce our exposure in these areas include purchasing reinsurance as discussed below  a moratorium on personal homeowners new business writings and the non renewal of select policies in eight coastal counties in the state of new york  a definitive agreement with universal whereby a portion of existing customers in florida will have new policies available when their policies expire and are not renewed  and exiting the commercial property market in florida beginning in may we have also received approval for homeowners premium rate increases in the state of florida averaging implemented in august  followed by an additional rate increase averaging  implemented in october the october rate increase is subject to review by the state regulator to the extent that the actual expense ratios  including the cost of additional reinsurance to be acquired  are less than estimated expense ratios in the rate increase filings 
further  the rate increase is subject to refund or credits to the extent the approved rate is determined to have resulted in an excessive rate for the month period starting october  while hurricanes can also be devastating to inland areas  we anticipate that our actions will be less extensive in these areas and they will be determined based on an assessment of our local exposure 
earthquakes we consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to earthquakes to be major metropolitan areas near fault lines in the states of california  oregon  washington  south carolina  missouri  kentucky and tennessee 
premiums written attributable to earthquake coverage totaled approximately million in earthquake coverage is generally written as an option or as a standard covered peril depending on policy language requirements in each state 
our current strategy is to significantly reduce earthquake exposure by limiting earthquake coverage in policies  pursuing alternative markets for placement of this coverage and purchasing reinsurance 
the implementation of the alternative markets strategy is subject to the identification and negotiation of arrangements with other companies to allow our agencies to place the coverage 
our initial focus will be in states with the highest earthquake exposure 
examples of actions we have already taken in these areas include our discontinuation of writing earthquake coverage in california following the formation of the cea in  allowing our agencies to place new business earthquake coverage with another carrier in the state of south carolina beginning in and no longer offering new optional coverage and removing optional coverage from policies in most states beginning in we also continue to evaluate purchases of reinsurance including coverage for potential assessments from the cea 
we anticipate that implementation of limitations on new and renewal optional earthquake coverage will not adversely impact either auto or homeowners production and that it will cause a relatively immaterial decline in premiums written  but will result in a material reduction of exposure from catastrophic earthquake losses 
we also expect that this reduction in exposure will allow for some reduction in our capital requirements 
we include catastrophe losses in property liability claims and claims expense 
as a result  catastrophe losses affect both our underwriting results and loss ratios

in addition  allstate floridian has reinsurance on certain personal homeowners policies in florida with universal 
for further discussion of these reinsurance and other recoveries  see the reinsurance section of the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a and note and of the consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third party adjusters  appraisers  engineers  inspectors  other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non catastrophe related claims 
for example  during the fourth quarter of our longstanding contract with pilot catastrophe services pilot for additional claims adjustors aided in our ability to complete more timely claims payments 
catastrophe losses also include million of accruals for two assessments from fl citizens and million from louisiana citizens property insurance corporation la citizens 
these entities were created by their respective states to provide insurance to property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market and can levy an assessment on participating companies for a financial deficit 
after paying assessments  we expect that our subsidiaries will be able to recoup them in part through premiums written in the state 
these recoupments will be recorded as an offset to catastrophe losses in the period that the related premiums are written and are expected to be primarily recorded over the next two years 
for further discussion of these assessments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
claims and claims expense during includes estimated catastrophe losses of billion  net of recoveries from the fhcf  related to hurricanes charley  frances  ivan  and jeanne 
this estimate includes net losses on personal lines auto and property policies and net losses on commercial policies 
allstate protection outlook we expect to see continued growth of allstate brand auto premiums written due to increased pif resulting from increases in the number of agencies representing us  advertising effectiveness and higher customer loyalty  however total allstate protection premiums written will likely be comparable to levels due to the estimated effects of catastrophe management actions on property premiums  including the impacts of increased ceded premiums for catastrophe reinsurance 
we expect to experience a slowing rate of decline in our non standard auto product and encompass brand standard auto while maintaining profitability in these businesses 
we expect that volatility in the level of catastrophes or claim frequency we experience will contribute to variation in our underwriting results  however this volatility will be somewhat mitigated due to our catastrophe management actions including purchases of reinsurance 
we will continue to study the efficiencies of our operations and cost structure for additional areas where costs may be reduced 
any reductions in costs we achieve  however  may be offset by the costs of other new initiatives  such as increased expenditures for technology and reinsurance 
for example  there will be an investment in claims technology of approximately million over  and as a result of our claims system reengineering 
in addition  other factors may increase our expenses  including increases in benefit expenses and guaranty fund assessments 
discontinued lines and coverages segment overview the discontinued lines and coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run off 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims is reported in this segment 
we have assigned management of this segment to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling  policy coverage interpretation and exposure identification 
as part of its responsibilities  this group is also regularly engaged in policy buybacks  settlements and reinsurance assumed and ceded commutations 
summarized underwriting results for the years ended december  are presented in the following table 
in millions premiums written premiums earned claims and claims expense other costs and expenses underwriting loss during  the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling million 
the cost of administering claims settlements totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the underwriting loss was primarily due to reestimates of asbestos reserves totaling million  and an increase of million in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance 
see the property liability claims and claims expense reserves section of the md a for a more detailed discussion 
discontinued lines and coverages outlook we may continue to experience asbestos losses in the future 
these losses could be due to the potential adverse impact of new information relating to new and additional claims or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as litigation or legislative  judicial and regulatory actions 
because of our annual ground up review  we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available information  technology  laws and regulations 
we are somewhat encouraged that the pace of industry asbestos claim activity seems to be slowing  perhaps reflecting various recent state legislative and judicial actions with respect to medical criteria and increased legal scrutiny of the legitimacy of claims 
in addition  we continue to monitor the possibility of federal legislation related to these claims

property liability investment outlook as a result of our recent years catastrophe experience and the level of dividends paid by allstate insurance company aic to the allstate corporation in  investment income for is expected to slightly decline relative to the prior year due to lower cash flows from operating activities causing a decline in portfolio balances 
allstate expects to experience lower investment yields due  in part  to the reinvestment of proceeds from maturities and the investment of cash flows from operations in securities yielding less than the average portfolio rate due to the impact of the current interest rate environment 
property liability claims and claims expense reserves underwriting results of property liability are significantly influenced by estimates of property liability claims and claims expense reserves 
we describe our reserve process in the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a and note of the consolidated financial statements 
these reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including ibnr claims  as of the reporting date 
reserves are established for claims as they occur for each line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to settle the claims 
the actual loss results are compared to prior estimates and differences are recorded as reserve reestimates 
the primary actuarial technique used to estimate reserves and provide for losses is a chain ladder estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses paid losses plus individual case reserves set by claim adjusters for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time 
an accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred 
a report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported 
both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future 
in the chain ladder estimation technique  a ratio development factor is calculated which compares current results to results in the prior period for each accident year 
a three year or two year average development factor  based on historical results  is usually multiplied by the current experience to estimate the development of losses of each accident year from the current time period into the next time period 
the development factors for the next time periods for each accident year are compounded over the remaining calendar years to calculate an estimate of ultimate losses for each accident year 
occasionally  unusual aberrations in loss patterns are caused by factors such as changes in claim reporting  settlement patterns  unusually large losses  process changes  legal or regulatory changes  and other influences 
in these instances  analyses of alternate development factor selections are performed to evaluate the effect of these factors  and actuarial judgment is applied to make appropriate development factor assumptions needed to develop a best estimate of ultimate losses 
paid losses are then subtracted from estimated ultimate losses to determine the indicated reserves 
the difference between indicated reserves and recorded reserves is the amount of reserve reestimate 
reserves are reestimated quarterly 
when new development factors are calculated from actual losses  and they differ from estimated development factors used in previous reserve estimates  assumptions about losses and required reserves are revised based on the new development factors 
changes to reserves are recorded in the period in which development factor changes result in reserve reestimates 
over one thousand actuarial estimates of the types described above are prepared each quarter to monitor losses for each line of insurance  major components of losses such as coverages and perils  major states or groups of states and for reported losses and ibnr 
often  several different estimates are prepared for each detailed component  incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses  from which we select our best estimate for each component  occasionally incorporating additional analyses and actuarial judgment  as described above 
these estimates also incorporate the historical impact of inflation into reserve estimates  the implicit assumption being that a multi year average development factor represents an adequate provision 
based on our review of these estimates  our best estimate of required reserves for each state line coverage component is recorded for each accident year  and the required reserves for each component are summed to create the reserve balances carried on our consolidated statements of financial position 
the facts and circumstances leading to our reestimate of reserves relate to revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
reestimates occur because actual losses are different than that predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates 
at december   the impact of a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent increase in net reserves would be a decrease of approximately million in net income 
a reserve reestimation resulting in a one percent decrease in net reserves would increase net income by approximately million 
for a further description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates  see the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a 
for allstate protection  at each reporting date the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates of losses arises from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year 
the greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because  at the end of the current accident year  the percentage of losses that have not been reported or settled and that consequently must be estimated  is higher than it will be as time elapses 
most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and to medical care for injuries from accidents 
during the first year after the end of an accident year  a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled 
when accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates  the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly 
consequently  this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year 
after the second year  the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle  such as those involving serious injuries or litigation 
private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates our typical annual percentage payout of reserves estimated losses for an accident year is approximately in the first year after the end of the accident year  in the second year  in the third year  in the fourth year  and the remaining thereafter

this was primarily due to auto injury severity development and late reported loss development that was better than expected 
the allstate brand experienced million of favorable prior year reserve reestimates in this was primarily due to auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than expected and the release of reserves due to lower than anticipated losses in texas related to mold claims 
these trends are primarily responsible for revisions to loss development factors  as previously described  used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid 
because these trends cause actual losses to differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates  reserves are revised as actuarial studies validate new trends  based on the indications of updated development factor calculations 
the impact of these reestimates on the allstate brand underwriting loss income is shown in the table below 
in millions reserve reestimates allstate brand underwriting loss income   reserve reestimates as a of underwriting loss income encompass brand reserve reestimates in were related to lower than anticipated claim settlement costs

the impact of these reestimates on the encompass brand underwriting loss income is shown in the table below 
in millions reserve reestimates encompass brand underwriting loss income reserve reestimates as a of underwriting loss income discontinued lines and coverages we conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines reserves 
reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined 
using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment  this detailed and comprehensive ground up methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders 
reserve reestimates for the discontinued lines and coverages  as shown in the table below  were increased primarily for asbestos in and for asbestos and other discontinued lines in and in millions jan reserves reserve reestimate jan reserves reserve reestimate jan reserves reserve reestimate asbestos claims   environmental claims other discontinued lines total discontinued lines and coverages   underwriting loss income reserve reestimates as a of underwriting loss income reserve additions for asbestos in  and  totaling million  million and million  respectively  were primarily for products related coverage 
they were essentially a result of a continuing level of increased claim activity being reported by excess insurance policyholders with existing active claims  excess policyholders with new claims  and reestimates of liabilities for increased assumed reinsurance cessions  as ceding companies other insurance carriers also experienced increased claim activity 
increased claim activity over prior estimates has also resulted in an increased estimate for future claims reported 
these trends are consistent with the trends of other carriers in the industry  which we believe are related to increased publicity and awareness of coverage  ongoing litigation  potential congressional activity  and bankruptcy actions 
during  reserve reestimates  including an increase in the allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables  included million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off  and million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures 
during  reserve reestimates included million for other discontinued lines exposures in run off  and million related to the cost of administering claim settlements and miscellaneous run off exposures 
our exposure to asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the s through the mid s  including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large united states companies  and from direct excess insurance written from through  including substantial excess general liability coverages on fortune companies 
additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the s through the mid s 
other discontinued lines exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims  such as those for medical devices and other products 
in  the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property liability industry was amended to introduce an absolute pollution exclusion  which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims  and to add an asbestos exclusion 
most general liability policies issued prior to contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage 
general liability policies issued in and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages 
our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks 
our exposure to liability for asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage  direct excess insurance  or direct primary commercial insurance 
the direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines was substantially excess in nature 
direct excess insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans 
the nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention or primary insurance plans 
our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we have purchased on our direct excess business 
our assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers reinsurance programs 
the reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions 
the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure  approximately  is for excess of loss coverage  while the remaining is for pro rata coverage 
our direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers 
this business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors located throughout the country 
the table below summarizes reserves and claim activity for asbestos and environmental claims before gross and after net the effects of reinsurance for the past three years 
in millions  except ratios gross net gross net gross net asbestos claims beginning reserves     incurred claims and claims expense claims and claims expense paid ending reserves       annual survival ratio year survival ratio environmental claims beginning reserves incurred claims and claims expense claims and claims expense paid ending reserves annual survival ratio year survival ratio combined environmental and asbestos claims annual survival ratio year survival ratio percentage of ibnr in ending reserves the survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year 
this is a commonly used but extremely simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels 
many factors  such as mix of business  level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves  claim payments and the resultant ratio 
as payments result in corresponding reserve reductions  survival ratios can be expected to vary over time 
in  the asbestos survival ratio declined due to an increase in claims paid  primarily due to commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements that  in turn caused reduced reserve levels 
in  the asbestos survival ratios improved due to higher reserve balances and relatively low payments 
in  the environmental survival ratios improved due to lower claim payments 
the total commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements and the survival ratios for asbestos and environmental claims for  and excluding these commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements  are represented in the following table 
in millions  except ratios gross net gross net gross net asbestos claims commutations  policy buy backs settlement agreements annual survival ratio year survival ratio environmental claims commutations  policy buy backs settlement agreements annual survival ratio year survival ratio combined environmental and asbestos claims total commutations  policy buy backs settlement agreements annual survival ratio year survival ratio our three year net average survival ratio excluding commutations  policy buy backs  and settlement agreements is viewed to be another measure of current reserve adequacy as it determines a more normalized survival ratio by measuring the impact over three years and by excluding from payments amounts no longer carried in the reserves and not viewed in this ratio as a continuing payment level 
now at years for asbestos as of december   we consider it to represent a strong reserve position 
a one year increase in the three year average asbestos survival ratio at december  would require an after tax increase in reserves of approximately million 
our net asbestos reserves by type of exposure and total reserve additions are shown in the following table

the increase comprised from  from and from the increase of from included new policyholders reporting new claims and policyholders claims were closed 
reserve additions for asbestos for the year ended december   totaled million and included the following factors direct primary insurance net reserves decreased by million 
we were not a significant direct primary insurer and did not insure any of the large asbestos manufacturers on a direct primary insurance basis 
direct excess insurance net reserves decreased by million as a result of significant settlement activity including two major settlements during the fourth quarter of assumed reinsurance net reserves decreased by million due to a significant commutation that occurred in the fourth quarter of the number of reported new claims is shown in the following table 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  new claims new claims are defined as the aggregate number of policyholders with claims reported by all ceding companies 
ibnr net reserves increased by million in anticipation of continued claims activity 
at december  ibnr represented of total asbestos reserves  points higher than at december  ibnr reserves are estimated to provide for probable future unfavorable reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current and new insurance policyholders and ceding companies 
our non products case reserves represent approximately of total asbestos case reserves 
we do not anticipate significant changes in this percentage as insureds retentions associated with excess insurance programs and assumed reinsurance exposure are seldom exceeded 
we did not write direct primary insurance on policyholders with the potential for significant non products related loss exposure 
for environmental exposures  a comprehensive ground up review  using processes similar to those used for the asbestos review  is also conducted in the third quarter of each year 
the analysis performed in  and produced essentially no change in reserve estimates 
pending  new  total closed and closed without payment claims for asbestos and environmental exposures for the years ended december  are summarized in the following table 
number of claims asbestos pending  beginning of year    new    total closed   pending  end of year    closed without payment environmental pending  beginning of year    new  total closed    pending  end of year    closed without payment    our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform  class action litigation  and other potential legislation and judicial decisions 
environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal superfund law and similar state statutes 
there can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair  effective and cost efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims 
we are unable to determine the effect  if any  that such legislation will have on results of operations or financial position 
reserves for other discontinued lines provide for remaining loss and loss expense liabilities related to business no longer written by us  other than asbestos and environmental  and are presented in the following table 
in millions other mass torts workers compensation commercial and other other discontinued lines other mass torts describes direct excess and reinsurance general liability coverage provided for cumulative injury losses other than asbestos and environmental 
workers compensation and commercial and other include run off from discontinued direct primary  direct excess and reinsurance commercial insurance operations of various coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental 
reserves are based on considerations similar to those previously described  as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures 
we believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on assessments of pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure eg claim activity  potential liability  jurisdiction  products versus non products exposure presented by individual policyholders  assuming no change in the legal  legislative or economic environment 
another comprehensive ground up review will be completed in the third quarter of  as well as assessments each quarter to determine if any intervening significant events or developments require an interim adjustment to reserves 
property liability reinsurance ceded for allstate protection  we utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage capital  while lessening earnings volatility and improving shareholder return  and to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as allstate floridian insurance company and allstate new jersey insurance company 
we purchase significant reinsurance where we believe the greatest benefit may be achieved relative to our aggregate countrywide exposure 
the price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process  along with whether the price can be appropriately reflected in the costs that are considered in setting future rates charged to policyholders 
we also participate in various reinsurance mechanisms  including industry pools and facilities  and have purchased reinsurance to mitigate long tail liability lines  including environmental  asbestos and other discontinued lines exposures 
we retain primary liability as a direct insurer for all risks ceded to reinsurers 
the impacts of reinsurance on our reserve for claims and claims expense at december are summarized in the following table  net of allowances we have established for uncollectible amounts 
gross claims and claims expense reserves reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid claims  net in millions industry pools and facilities     asbestos and environmental     other including allowance for future uncollectible reinsurance recoverables total property liability     when purchasing reinsurance  we evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer  as well as the terms and price of coverage 
estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverables is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of loss reserves 
we believe the recoverables are appropriately established  however  as our underlying reserves continue to develop  the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded 
we regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts recoverable  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
adverse developments in the insurance industry have recently led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers  causing amounts recoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk 
recently there has also been consolidation activity in the industry  which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies 
in addition  over the last several years the industry has increasingly segregated asbestos  environmental  and other discontinued lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital 
regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions 
we are unable to determine the impact  if any  that these developments will have on the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables in the future 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to discontinued lines and coverages reinsurance recoverables and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent and  respectively of the related reinsurance recoverable balances

multi year treaties these treaties have been in effect since and cover the allstate brand personal property catastrophe losses  expiring  except for the treaty in florida 
the florida treaty provides coverage for property policies written by allstate floridian and it expires this chart reflects our expectation that we will expand coverage limits by million per year on the new jersey and texas treaties effective  and that we expect to terminate the existing treaties in north carolina and south carolina on the retentions  limits and or reinsurance premiums on these treaties are also subject to annual remeasurements on their anniversary dates 
two separate reinsurance treaties provide coverage for catastrophe risks in the state of new york aic has a  retention and a  limit  and allstate indemnity company has a  retention and a  limit

these estimates are subject to annual remeasurements at the beginning of the fhcf fiscal year of this is an annual program with a first season and second season coverage provision 
new jersey agreement this agreement is being contemplated  but has not yet been placed 
this agreement is expected to be effective we anticipate that the total cost of these agreements will be approximately million per year or million per quarter 
this represents an increase of approximately million per year or million per quarter over our current cost  once these agreements are fully placed and effective 
based on the effective dates of these agreements  our costs are expected to be approximately million in the first quarter of  million in the second quarter of and million in the third and fourth quarters of we will aggressively seek regulatory approvals  despite the challenging regulatory environment in each state  to include reinsurance costs in our premium rates in order to mitigate the impact of this increase 
we currently expect that this level or a similar level of reinsurance coverage will be purchased or renewed for allstate financial highlights allstate financial revenues increased in compared to higher net investment income  increased contract charges and higher net realized capital gains  were partially offset by lower premiums

the execution of our business strategies has and may continue to involve simplifying our business model and focusing on those products and distribution relationships where we can secure strong leadership positions while generating acceptable returns 
this may require modifying the number and selection of products marketed for example  through such actions as our exit from the guaranteed investment contract market and the long term care product market and the sale of our direct response distribution business in  terminating underperforming distribution relationships  merging or disposing of non strategic legal entities such as the merger of glenbrook life and annuity company into allstate life insurance company alic in and the planned sales of five legal entities  reducing policy administration software systems  and other actions that we may determine are appropriate to successfully execute our business strategies 
our individual retail product line includes a wide variety of products designed to meet the financial protection  retirement and investment needs of our customers 
individual retail products include traditional life  interest sensitive life  supplemental accident and health insurance  variable life  fixed and variable annuities and funding agreements backing retail medium term notes

premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies declined primarily as a result of pricing actions taken to improve our returns on new business and reflect our current expectations of mortality 
our new pricing has led to a shift in our sales mix from immediate annuities with life contingencies to immediate annuities without life contingencies  which are accounted for as deposits rather than as premiums 
the decline in traditional life premiums was primarily due to the absence of certain premiums in resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution business in the increase in accident  health and other premiums was primarily attributable to higher underwriting retention 
total premiums decreased in compared to the decrease was primarily due to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business  which resulted in lower accident and health and other premiums and traditional life premiums 
additionally  reflects lower premiums on immediate annuities with life contingencies as underwriting actions taken in reduced the maximum premium received on individual contracts sold 
contract charges increased in compared to the increase was due to higher contract charges on interest sensitive life  variable annuities and  to a lesser extent  fixed annuities 
the increase in the interest sensitive life contract charges were attributable to in force business growth resulting from deposits and credited interest more than offsetting surrenders and benefits

 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop reflects the reclassification of certain products previously included as a component of separate accounts to contractholder funds  the reclassification of deferred sales inducements dsi from contractholder funds to other assets and the establishment of reserves for certain liabilities that are primarily related to income and other guarantees provided under fixed annuity  variable annuity and interest sensitive life contracts 
lower contractholder deposits and increased surrenders and partial withdrawals as well as higher institutional product maturities contributed to a reduction in the growth rate of contractholder funds in compared to average contractholder funds increased in compared to a increase in contractholder deposits decreased in compared to due to lower deposits on fixed annuities 
fixed annuity deposits declined in as lower deposits on traditional deferred fixed annuities and market value adjusted annuities were partially offset by increased deposits on immediate annuities without life contingencies 
the decline in fixed annuity deposits resulted from reduced consumer demand relative to certificates of deposit and other short term investments due to increases in short term interest rates without corresponding increases in longer term rates  and pricing actions to increase fixed annuity product returns 
a continuation of the current interest rate environment may limit the level of future fixed annuity deposits 
institutional product deposits decreased in compared to our institutional business sales remain opportunistic and  as such  institutional product deposits were intermittent during the year 
contractholder deposits increased in compared to due primarily to greater issuances of fixed annuities  interest sensitive life policies and retail and institutional funding agreements 
fixed annuity deposits increased in compared to due to strong consumer demand  competitive pricing and effective distribution efforts in our bank channel 
institutional product deposits increased in compared to  largely due to favorable market conditions for our funding agreements and the broadening of our customer base through the development and launch of our new securities and exchange commission sec registered program in the second quarter of and our new registered retail funding agreement program in the fourth quarter 
the registered programs generated billion of new funding agreement deposits during including million in retail funding agreement deposits 
surrenders and partial withdrawals increased in compared to driven mostly by higher surrenders of market value adjusted annuities due to a portion of these contracts entering a day window in which there were no surrender charges or market value adjustments 
the lack of surrender charges and market value adjustments combined with the interest rate environment  which included a relatively small difference between short term and long term interest rates  caused contractholders to choose competing short term investment alternatives

surrenders and withdrawals may vary with changes in interest rates and equity market conditions and the aging of our in force contracts 
separate accounts liabilities represent contractholders claims to the related separate accounts assets 
separate accounts liabilities primarily arise from the sale of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies

separate accounts liabilities increased as of december  compared to december  this is compared to an increase of as of december  compared to december  the decline in the rate at which separate accounts liabilities increased was primarily attributable to less favorable market performance and increased surrenders and benefits  partially offset by higher net deposits 
net variable annuity and life deposits increased in compared to and declined in compared to variable product deposits vary with equity market conditions and consumer preferences related to our product features 
variable annuity contractholders often allocate a significant portion of their initial variable annuity contract deposit into a fixed rate investment option 
the level of this activity is reflected above in the deposits allocated to fixed accounts  while all other transfer activity between the fixed and separate accounts investment options is reflected in net transfers from fixed accounts 
the liability for the fixed portion of variable annuity contracts is reflected in contractholder funds 
net investment income increased in compared to and in compared to the increase in was primarily the result of increased portfolio balances and  to a lesser extent  increased yields on floating rate assets due to higher short term interest rates and increased income on partnership interests  partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities 
in  the increase compared to was due to higher portfolio balances partially offset by lower portfolio yields 
higher portfolio balances in both years resulted from the investment of cash flows from operating and financing activities related primarily to deposits from fixed annuities  institutional funding agreements and interest sensitive life policies 
investment balances as of december   increased from december  and increased as of december  compared to december  the decline in the rate at which investments increased in compared to was the result of a lesser increase in contractholder funds and a decline in unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities in compared with a slight increase in changes in portfolio yields are primarily driven by purchases  including reinvestments  of fixed income securities with yields higher or lower than the current portfolio average as well as significant changes in short term interest rates

gross margin  a non gaap measure  represents life and annuity premiums and contract charges  net investment income and periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments  less contract benefits and interest credited to contractholder funds excluding amortization of dsi 
we reclassify periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments into gross margin to report them in a manner consistent with the economically hedged investments  replicated assets or product attributes eg net investment income or interest credited to contractholder funds and by doing so  appropriately reflect trends in product performance 
we use gross margin as a component of our evaluation of the profitability of allstate financial s life insurance and financial product portfolio 
additionally  for many of our products  including fixed annuities  variable life and annuities  and interest sensitive life insurance  the amortization of dac and dsi is determined based on actual and expected gross margin 
gross margin is comprised of three components that are utilized to further analyze the business investment margin  benefit margin  and contract charges and fees 
we believe gross margin and its components are useful to investors because they allow for the evaluation of income components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing performance 
gross margin  investment margin and benefit margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income and do not reflect the overall profitability of the business 
net income is the gaap measure that is most directly comparable to these margins 
gross margin is reconciled to allstate financial s gaap net income in the previous table

further  the allstate workplace division margins were conformed 
these reclassifications did not result in a change in gross margin 
gross margin increased in compared to and in compared to the increase in both periods was the result of higher investment margin and contract charges and fees  partially offset by lower benefit margin 
investment margin is a component of gross margin  both of which are non gaap measures 
investment margin represents the excess of net investment income and periodic settlements and accruals on certain non hedge derivative instruments over interest credited to contractholder funds and the implied interest on life contingent immediate annuities included in the reserve for life contingent contract benefits

we use the benefit margin to evaluate allstate financial s underwriting performance  as it reflects the profitability of our products with respect to mortality or morbidity risk during a fiscal period 
benefit margin by product group is shown in the following table 
in millions life insurance annuities total benefit margin and have been restated to conform to the current period presentation 
benefit margin declined in compared to our life insurance and annuity business contributed equally to the decline in the decline in our annuity benefit margin was primarily driven by unfavorable mortality experience on immediate annuities with life contingencies and an increase in variable annuity contract benefits 
the decline in our life insurance benefit margin was primarily due to the absence of margin on certain products resulting from the disposal of our direct response distribution business in the prior year and modestly unfavorable mortality experience on our traditional life business  partially offset by growth in our life insurance in force 
benefit margin decreased in compared to this decline was primarily the result of the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business and unfavorable mortality experience on life contingent immediate annuities  partially offset by an improved benefit margin on life insurance products and lower contract benefits related to guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdbs on variable annuities 
as required by sop  as of january   a reserve was established for death and income benefits provided under variable annuities and secondary guarantees on certain interest sensitive life contracts and fixed annuities 
for variable annuities  the reserve includes gmdbs and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmibs 
annuity benefit margin will continue to be adversely impacted by certain closed blocks of life contingent immediate annuities for which benefit payments are anticipated to extend beyond their original pricing expectations 
the annuity benefit margin in future periods will fluctuate based on the timing of annuitant deaths on these life contingent immediate annuities and the annual evaluation of assumptions used in our valuation models for variable and fixed annuity guarantees 
amortization of dac and dsi  excluding amortization related to realized capital gains and losses  increased in compared to as a result of higher gross margin 
dac and dsi amortization related to realized capital gains and losses  after tax  increased million in compared to primarily due to increased realized capital gains on investments supporting certain fixed annuities 
in the first quarter of  we performed our annual comprehensive evaluation of the assumptions used in our valuation models for all investment products  including variable and fixed annuities and interest sensitive and variable life products  which resulted in net dac and dsi amortization acceleration of million commonly referred to as dac and dsi unlocking 
the dac and dsi unlocking includes amortization acceleration on fixed annuities of million and million on interest sensitive and variable life products  partially offset by amortization deceleration on variable annuities of million 
the amortization acceleration on fixed annuities was primarily due to higher than expected lapses on market value adjusted annuities and faster than anticipated investment portfolio yield declines 
the amortization deceleration on variable annuities was mostly attributable to better than anticipated equity market performance and persistency in in the prior year  the comparable dac and dsi unlocking was a net acceleration of amortization of million  which included deceleration of amortization related to interest sensitive life and acceleration of amortization related to fixed annuities 
amortization of dac and dsi increased during compared to the higher amortization is reflective of increased gross margins on fixed and variable annuities 
in  amortization of dac and dsi included a net acceleration of dac amortization totaling million and million of dac amortization on the direct response distribution business sold in the adoption of sop in required a new modeling approach for estimating expected future gross profits that are used when determining the amortization of dac 
because of this new modeling approach  effective january   the variable annuity dac and dsi assets were reduced by million 
this reduction was recognized as a component of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the changes in the dac asset are summarized in the following tables

the impact of adoption of sop includes a write down in variable annuity dac of million  the reclassification of dsi from dac to other assets resulting in a decrease to dac of million  an increase to dac of million for an adjustment to the effect of unrealized capital gains and losses and the reclassification of unearned revenue from dac to contractholder funds resulting in an increase to dac of million 
the amortization of dac for interest sensitive life  variable annuities and investment contracts is proportionate to the recognition of gross profits  which include realized capital gains and losses 
fluctuations in amortization for these products may result as actual realized capital gains and losses differ from the amounts utilized in the determination of estimated gross profits 
amortization related to realized capital gains and losses was million and million in and  respectively 
operating costs and expenses declined slightly in compared to and decreased in compared to the following table summarizes operating costs and expenses 
in millions non deferrable acquisition costs other operating costs and expenses total operating costs and expenses non deferrable acquisition costs declined in compared to as the prior year included a million charge related to loss experience on certain credit insurance policies 
the impact of this charge was partially offset by higher premium taxes and non deferrable commissions in other operating costs and expenses increased in compared to primarily due to a million increase in a liability for future benefits of a previously discontinued benefit plan  partially offset by lower employee and technology expenses reflecting our continuing actions to simplify operations and reduce costs 
the decline in total operating costs and expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to the disposal of substantially all of our direct response distribution business 
excluding the impact of the disposition  non deferrable acquisition costs increased due to higher non deferrable renewal commissions  taxes  licenses and fees  and the charge related to loss experience on certain credit insurance policies 
for other operating costs and expenses  the decline due to the disposition was partially offset by higher technology and employee related expenses

we continuously monitor the creditworthiness of reinsurers in order to determine our risk of recoverability on an individual and aggregate basis  and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded if needed 
no amounts have been deemed unrecoverable in the three years ended december  we enter into certain inter company reinsurance transactions for the allstate financial operations in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities 
these reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities 
all significant inter company transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
allstate financial outlook allstate financial is pursuing strategies intended to improve its return on equity 
these strategies include continuing to proactively manage capital and focus our product portfolio on products where we can secure market leadership and achieve acceptable returns 
we will continue to manage our expenses and improve our operating efficiency 
we plan to reinvigorate sales through the allstate exclusive agencies by further tailoring products for our customers and making it easier for our agents to distribute allstate financial products 
we prioritize the allocation of fixed income investments to support sales of products with the best sustainable growth and margins and to maintain a market presence for fixed annuity and life products in our retail distribution channels 
our institutional products remain opportunistic 
investments an important component of our financial results is the return on our investment portfolios 
investment portfolios are segmented between the property liability  allstate financial and corporate and other operations 
the investment portfolios are managed based upon the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability structure 
overview and strategy the property liability portfolio s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
this approach  which has produced competitive returns over time  is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
we employ a strategic asset allocation model  which takes into account the nature of the liabilities and risk tolerances  as well as the risk return parameters of the various asset classes in which we invest 
the model s recommended asset allocation  along with duration and liquidity considerations  guides our initial asset allocation 
this is further adjusted based on our analysis of relative value opportunities in different markets 
portfolio performance is measured against outside benchmarks at target allocation weights 
the allstate financial portfolio s investment strategy focuses on the need for risk adjusted spread on the underlying liabilities while maximizing return on capital 
we believe investment spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults 
we believe this strategy maintains the investment margin necessary to sustain income over time 
the portfolio management approach employs a combination of recognized market  analytical and proprietary modeling  including a strategic asset allocation model  as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive  illiquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements 
within the ranges set by the strategic asset allocation model  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
the corporate and other portfolio s investment strategy balances the pursuit of competitive returns with the unique liquidity needs of the portfolio relative to the overall corporate capital structure 
the portfolio is primarily invested in high quality  highly liquid fixed income and short term securities with additional investments in less liquid holdings in order to enhance overall returns 
as a result of tactical decisions in each of the portfolios  we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities 
portfolio reviews  which include identifying securities that are other than temporarily impaired and recognizing impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery  are conducted regularly

corporate bonds totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  as of december   the portfolio contained billion of privately placed corporate obligations  of the total corporate obligations in the portfolio  compared with billion at december  approximately billion or of the privately placed corporate obligations consisted of fixed rate privately placed securities 
the benefits of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities are generally higher yields  improved cash flow predictability through pro rata sinking funds  and a combination of covenant and call protection features designed to better protect the holder against losses resulting from credit deterioration  reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates 
a disadvantage of fixed rate privately placed securities when compared to publicly issued securities is relatively reduced liquidity 
at december   of the privately placed securities were rated investment grade 
foreign government securities totaled billion and were rated investment grade at december  mortgage backed securities mbs totaled billion at december   all of which were investment grade 
in our mbs portfolio  the credit risk associated with mbs is mitigated due to the fact that the portfolio consists of securities that were issued by  or have underlying collateral that is guaranteed by  us government agencies or us government sponsored entities 
the mbs portfolio is subject to interest rate risk since price volatility and the ultimate realized yield are affected by the rate of prepayment of the underlying mortgages 
commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs totaled billion at december  cmbs investments primarily represent pools of commercial mortgages  broadly diversified across property types and geographical area 
the cmbs portfolio is subject to credit risk  but unlike other structured products  is generally not subject to prepayment risk due to protections within the underlying commercial mortgages  whereby borrowers are effectively restricted from prepaying their mortgages due to changes in interest rates 
credit defaults can result in credit directed prepayments 
approximately of the cmbs portfolio had a moody s rating of aaa or a standard poor s rating of aaa  the highest rating category  at december  asset backed securities abs totaled billion at december  our abs portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the collateral

approximately million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio were associated with the automobile industry  which includes direct debt issuances of automobile manufacturers  captive automotive financing companies and automobile parts and equipment suppliers  which are reported above in the consumer goods and financial services sectors 
fixed income security values in the automobile industry were primarily depressed due to company specific conditions 
additionally  approximately million of the total gross unrealized losses in the corporate fixed income portfolio and million of the total gross unrealized losses in the asset backed securities portfolio were associated with the airline industry for which values were depressed due to company or issue specific conditions and economic issues  including fuel costs

due to lags between the funding of an investment  execution of final legal documents  filing with the securities valuation office svo of the naic  and rating by the svo  we will always have a small number of securities that have a pending rating 
at december   million  or  of the gross unrealized losses were related to investment grade fixed income securities 
unrealized losses on investment grade securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in sector related credit spreads since the securities were acquired 
as of december   million of the gross unrealized losses were related to below investment grade fixed income securities 
of this amount  were in a significant unrealized loss position greater than or equal to of amortized cost for six or more consecutive months prior to december  included among the securities rated below investment grade are both public and privately placed high yield bonds and securities that were investment grade when originally acquired 
we mitigate the credit risk of investing in below investment grade fixed income securities by limiting the percentage of our fixed income portfolio invested in such securities  through diversification of the portfolio  and active credit monitoring and portfolio management

we expect eventual recovery of these securities and the related sectors 
all securities in an unrealized loss position at december  were included in our portfolio monitoring process wherein it was determined that the declines in value were not other than temporary 
portfolio monitoring we have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate  on a case by case basis  fixed income and equity securities whose carrying value may be other than temporarily impaired 
the process includes a quarterly review of all securities using a screening process to identify those securities whose fair value compared to amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities is below established thresholds for certain time periods  or which are identified through other monitoring criteria such as ratings downgrades or payment defaults 
the securities identified  in addition to other securities for which we may have a concern  are evaluated based on facts and circumstances for inclusion on our watch list 
as a result of approved programs involving the disposition of investments such as changes in duration and revisions to strategic asset allocations  and certain dispositions anticipated by portfolio managers  we also conduct a portfolio review to recognize impairment on securities in an unrealized loss position for which we do not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery

the degree to which and or length of time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position does not suggest that these securities pose a high risk of being other than temporarily impaired 
categories iii and iv have primarily been adversely affected by industry and issue specific conditions 
all of the securities in these categories are monitored for impairment 
we expect that the fair values of these securities will recover over time 
whenever our initial analysis indicates that a fixed income security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months or any equity security s unrealized loss of or more for at least months is temporary  additional evaluations and management approvals are required to substantiate that a write down is not appropriate

potential problem fixed income securities are current with respect to contractual principal and or interest  but because of other facts and circumstances  we have concerns regarding the borrower s ability to pay future principal and interest  which causes us to believe these securities may be classified as problem or restructured in the future 
the following table summarizes problem  restructured and potential problem fixed income securities at december in millions amortized cost fair value percent of total fixed income portfolio amortized cost fair value percent of total fixed income portfolio problem restructured potential problem total net carrying value cumulative write downs recognized we have experienced an increase in the amortized cost of fixed income securities categorized as problem as of december  compared to december  the increase was primarily related to the addition of securities to the problem category as a result of company specific issues  including the bankruptcy filings of certain airlines 
the decrease in the amortized cost of fixed income securities categorized as restructured and potential problem as of december  compared to december  was primarily related to dispositions 
we evaluated each of these securities through our portfolio monitoring process at december  and recorded write downs when appropriate 
we further concluded that any remaining unrealized losses on these securities were temporary in nature and that we have the intent and ability to hold the security until recovery 
while these balances may increase in the future  particularly if economic conditions are unfavorable  management expects that the total amount of securities in these categories will remain low relative to the total fixed income securities portfolio 
net realized capital gains and losses the following table presents the components of realized capital gains and losses and the related tax effect for the years ended december in millions investment write downs dispositions valuation of derivative instruments settlement of derivative instruments realized capital gains and losses  pretax income tax expense realized capital gains and losses  after tax dispositions in the above table include sales  losses recognized in anticipation of dispositions and other transactions such as calls and prepayments 
we may sell securities during the period in which fair value has declined below amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities 
in certain situations new factors such as negative developments  subsequent credit deterioration  relative value opportunities  market liquidity concerns and portfolio reallocations can subsequently change our previous intent to continue holding a security 
included in investment write downs were million of realized losses related to airline industry holdings 
for the year ended december   dispositions included net realized gains on sales of million and losses recorded in connection with anticipated dispositions of million 
the net realized gains were comprised of gross gains of billion and gross losses of million 
the million in gross losses primarily consisted of million from sales of fixed income securities and million from sales of equity securities 
a changing interest rate environment will drive changes in our portfolio duration targets at a tactical level 
a duration target and range is established with an economic view of liabilities relative to a long term portfolio view 
tactical duration adjustments within management s approved ranges are accomplished through both cash market transactions and derivative activities that generate realized gains and losses and through new purchases 
as a component of our approach to managing portfolio duration  realized gains and losses on derivative instruments are most appropriately considered in conjunction with the unrealized gains and losses on the fixed income portfolio 
this approach mitigates the impacts of general interest rate changes to the overall financial condition of the corporation 
because of the level of catastrophe losses experienced during and the possibility that we may need to have additional cash available to pay claims  we identified a portfolio from which we would consider selecting specific securities to sell to meet these needs 
certain of these securities we identified were in an unrealized loss position  for which we recognized million of losses in anticipation of dispositions due to a change in our intent to hold the securities until recovery 
at december   the fair value of the securities in this portfolio was billion 
because of an anticipated rise in interest rates  as well as changes in existing market conditions and long term asset return assumptions  certain changes are planned within various portfolios 
these included continued asset liability management strategies  on going comprehensive reviews of our portfolios  and changes being made to our strategic asset allocations  including property liability duration 
in addition  we decided to pursue yield enhancement strategies for the allstate financial portfolio 
certain of the securities we identified were in an unrealized loss position  for which we recognized million of losses in anticipation of dispositions due to a change in our intent to hold the securities until recovery 
at december   the fair value of the securities in these portfolios was billion 
gains from dispositions during include million of net capital gains from a repositioning of the equity portfolio and million of net capital gains from the liquidation of the allstate floridian insurance company portfolio in anticipation of liquidity needs to settle hurricane catastrophe claims 
the ten largest losses from sales of individual securities for the year ended december  totaled million with the largest being million and the smallest being million 
none of the million related to securities that were in an unrealized loss position greater than or equal to of amortized cost for fixed income securities or cost for equity securities for a period of six or more consecutive months prior to sale 
our largest aggregate loss on dispositions and writedowns are shown in the following table by issuer and its affiliates 
no other issuer together with its affiliates had an aggregated loss on dispositions and writedowns greater than of the total gross loss on dispositions and writedowns on fixed income and equity securities

holdings include fixed income securities at amortized cost or equity securities at cost 
losses due to a decision to decrease our exposure to two large domestic auto manufacturers and as a result of changing economic circumstances  including the decline in their overall market share 
the circumstances of the above losses are considered to be company specific and are not expected to have an effect on other holdings in our portfolios 
mortgage loans our mortgage loan portfolio which is primarily held in the allstate financial portfolio was billion at december  and billion at december   and comprised primarily of loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate 
geographical and property type diversification are key considerations used to manage our mortgage loan risk 
we closely monitor our commercial mortgage loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis 
loans with an estimated collateral value less than the loan balance  as well as loans with other characteristics indicative of higher than normal credit risk  are reviewed by financial and investment management at least quarterly for purposes of establishing valuation allowances and placing loans on non accrual status 
the underlying collateral values are based upon either discounted property cash flow projections or a commonly used valuation method that utilizes a one year projection of expected annual income divided by an expected rate of return 
we had no net realized capital losses related to write downs on mortgage loans for the year ended december  and had million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
short term investments our short term investment portfolio was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we invest available cash balances primarily in taxable short term securities having a final maturity date or redemption date of less than one year 
we also participate in securities lending  primarily as an investment yield enhancement  with third parties such as brokerage firms 
we obtain collateral in an amount generally equal to and of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities  respectively  and monitor the market value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary 
the cash we receive is invested in short term and fixed income investments  and an offsetting liability is recorded in other liabilities and accrued expense 
at december   the amount of securities lending collateral reinvested in short term investments had a carrying value of million 
this compares to billion at december  market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity  or currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices  although we also have a smaller exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations 
we may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges rebalancing existing asset or liability portfolios  changing the character of investments purchased in the future and using derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
for a more detailed discussion of our use of derivative financial instruments  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
overview we generate substantial investible funds from our property liability and allstate financial businesses 
in formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds  we seek to earn returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive rates and prices to customers while contributing to attractive and stable profits and long term capital growth 
accordingly  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each business 
investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks  including accountability and control over risk management activities 
subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these investment policies specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary 
executive oversight and investment activities are conducted primarily through subsidiaries boards of directors and investment committees 
for allstate financial  its asset liability management alm policies further define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks 
alm focuses on strategies to enhance yields  mitigate investment risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns for allstate financial 
allstate financial alm activities follow asset liability policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors 
these alm policies specify limits  ranges and or targets for investments that best meet allstate financial s business objectives in light of its product liabilities 
we manage our exposure to market risk through the use of asset allocation  duration and value at risk limits  through the use of simulation and  as appropriate  through the use of stress tests 
we have asset allocation limits that place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
we have duration limits on the property liability and allstate financial investment portfolios and  as appropriate  on individual components of these portfolios 
these duration limits place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
our value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed income  equity  and currency markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
for allstate financial  this day to day management is integrated with and informed by the activities of the alm organization 
this integration results in a prudent  methodical and effective adjudication of market risk and return  conditioned by the unique demands and dynamics of allstate financial s product liabilities and supported by the application of advanced risk technology and analytics 
although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk  the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments differ considerably between the property liability and allstate financial businesses affecting investment decisions and risk parameters 
interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates 
this risk arises from many of our primary activities  as we invest substantial funds in interest rate sensitive assets and issue interest rate sensitive liabilities  primarily in our allstate financial operations 
we manage the interest rate risk in our assets relative to the interest rate risk in our liabilities 
one of the measures used to quantify this exposure is duration 
duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates 
for example  if interest rates increase basis points  the fair value of an asset exhibiting a duration of is expected to decrease in value by approximately 
at december   the difference between our asset and liability duration was approximately  compared to a gap at december  a positive duration gap indicates that the fair value of our assets is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the fair value of our liabilities 
most of our duration gap originates from the property liability operations  with the primary liabilities being auto and homeowners claims 
in the management of investments supporting the property liability business  we adhere to an objective of emphasizing safety of principal and consistency of income within a total return framework 
this approach is designed to ensure our financial strength and stability for paying claims  while maximizing economic value and surplus growth 
this objective generally results in a positive duration mismatch between the property liability assets and liabilities 
for the allstate financial business  we seek to invest premiums  contract charges and deposits to generate future cash flows that will fund future claims  benefits and expenses  and that will earn stable margins across a wide variety of interest rate and economic scenarios 
in order to achieve this objective and limit interest rate risk for allstate financial  we adhere to a philosophy of managing the duration of assets and related liabilities 
this philosophy may include using interest rate swaps  futures  forwards  caps and floors to reduce the interest rate risk resulting from mismatches between existing assets and liabilities  and financial futures and other derivative instruments to hedge the interest rate risk of anticipated purchases and sales of investments and product sales to customers 
we pledge and receive collateral on certain types of derivative contracts 
for futures and option contracts traded on exchanges  we have pledged securities as margin deposits totaling million as of december  for over the counter derivative transactions involving interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floor agreements  and credit default swaps  master netting agreements are used 
these agreements allow us to net payments due for transactions covered by the agreements  and when applicable  we are required to post collateral 
as of december   we held million of cash pledged by counterparties as collateral for over the counter instruments and did not have any collateral pledged to counterparties 
to calculate the duration gap between assets and liabilities  we project asset and liability cash flows and calculate their net present value using a risk free market interest rate adjusted for credit quality  sector attributes  liquidity and other specific risks 
duration is calculated by revaluing these cash flows at alternative interest rates and determining the percentage change in aggregate fair value 
the cash flows used in this calculation include the expected maturity and repricing characteristics of our derivative financial instruments  all other financial instruments as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and certain other items including unearned premiums  property liability claims and claims expense reserves  interest sensitive liabilities and annuity liabilities 
the projections include assumptions based upon historical market experience and our experience that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment  lapse  leverage and or option features of instruments  where applicable 
such assumptions relate primarily to mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  municipal housing bonds  callable municipal and corporate obligations  and fixed rate single and flexible premium deferred annuities 
additionally  the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property liability policies 
based upon the information and assumptions we use in this duration calculation  and interest rates in effect at december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates rate shock would decrease the net fair value of the assets and liabilities by approximately billion  compared to billion at december  there are billion of assets supporting life insurance products such as traditional and interest sensitive life that are not financial instruments 
these assets and the associated liabilities have not been included in the above estimate 
the billion of assets excluded from the calculation has decreased from the billion reported at december  due to a decrease in the in force account value of interest sensitive life products 
based on assumptions described above  in the event of a basis point immediate increase in interest rates  the assets supporting life insurance products would decrease in value by million  compared to a decrease of million at december  also reflected in the duration calculation are the effects of a program that uses short futures to manage the property liability interest rate risk exposures relative to duration targets 
based on contracts in place at december   we would recognize realized capital gains totaling million in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate increase and million in realized capital losses in the event of a basis point immediate  parallel interest rate decrease 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
to the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations  duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted 
additionally  our calculations assume that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates the term structure of interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates and or large changes in interest rates 
equity price risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets 
at december   we held approximately billion in common stocks and billion in other securities with equity risk including primarily convertible securities  limited partnership funds  non redeemable preferred securities and equity linked notes  compared to approximately billion in common stocks and billion in other equity investments at december  approximately and of these totals  respectively  represented assets of the property liability operations at december   compared to approximately and  respectively  at december  at december   our portfolio of equity investments had a beta of approximately  compared to a beta of approximately at december  beta represents a widely used methodology to describe  quantitatively  an investment s market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the standard poor s composite price index s p 
based on the beta analysis  we estimate that if the s p decreases by  the fair value of our equity investments will decrease by approximately 
likewise  we estimate that if the s p increases by  the fair value of our equity investments will increase by approximately 
based upon the information and assumptions we used to calculate beta at december   we estimate that an immediate decrease in the s p of would decrease the net fair value of our equity investments identified above by approximately million  compared to million at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in the s p should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the beta of our equity investments was determined by comparing the monthly total returns of the equity investments to monthly total returns of the s p over a three year historical period 
since beta is historically based  projecting future price volatility using this method involves an inherent assumption that historical volatility and correlation relationships between stocks will not change in the future 
therefore  the illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if future volatility and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships 
at december  and  we had separate accounts assets related to variable annuity and variable life contracts with account values totaling billion and billion  respectively 
we earn contract charges as a percentage of these account values 
in the event of an immediate decline of in the account values due to equity market declines  we would have earned approximately million and million less in fee income at december  and december   respectively 
variable annuity contracts sold by allstate financial have a gmdb and customers may have chosen to purchase an enhanced gmdb  a gmib from to december   a truereturn sm guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab beginning in  and a sureincome sm guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb beginning in these guarantees subject us to additional equity market risk because the beneficiary or contractholder may receive a benefit that is greater than their corresponding account value 
gmdbs are payable upon death 
gmibs may be exercised on or after the tenth year anniversary not prior to of the contract if the contractholder elects to receive a defined stream of payments annuitize 
gmabs are credited to the contractholder account on a contract anniversary date that is pre determined by the contractholder  between the eighth and twentieth year after contract issue not prior to 
gmabs guarantee an account value of up to times or of the amount deposited in the contract  depending on the amount of time the contract is in force and adherence to certain fund allocation requirements 
gmwbs may be payable if the contractholder elects to take partial withdrawals 
gmwbs guarantee that the contractholder can take annual partial withdrawals up to of the amount deposited in the contract until their withdrawals total the initial deposit 
in january  we established reserves for gmdbs and gmibs in conjunction with the adoption of sop because of this change in accounting  guarantee payments are now recognized over future periods rather than expensed as paid 
for more details about this adopted accounting guidance and the calculation of the related reserves see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
at december  and  the guaranteed value of the death benefits in excess of account values was estimated to be billion and billion  respectively  net of reinsurance 
the decrease in this estimate between periods is attributable to improved equity markets during and customer surrenders of contracts with in the money gmdbs 
in both periods  approximately half of this exposure is related to the return of deposits guarantee  while the remaining half is attributable to a death benefit guarantee greater than the original deposits 
in addition to reinsurance for a portion of these benefits  we entered into various derivative instruments beginning in to offset the risk of future death claims on substantially all new business issued on or after january  a similar program was established for gmabs in and for gmwbs in in the event of an immediate decline in account values of due to equity market declines  payments for guaranteed death benefits at december  would increase by an estimated million in these payments would be charged against the related reserve rather than directly to earnings as paid 
contributions to the reserve for gmdbs would increase by a nominal amount in in the event of an immediate decline in account values 
the selection of a immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee 
also  our actual payment experience in the future may not be consistent with the assumptions used in the model 
gmib contracts that we sold provide the contractholder with the right to annuitize based on the highest account value at any anniversary date or on a guaranteed earnings rate based on the initial account value over the specified period 
the guaranteed income benefit feature was first offered in our variable annuity products beginning in  with guaranteed benefits available for election by contractholders ten years after issue 
accordingly  the earliest date at which benefits could become payable is therefore  in the event of an immediate decline of in contractholders account values as of december  due to equity market declines  contributions to the reserve would be increased by approximately million in the selection of a immediate decrease should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an example to illustrate the potential effect on earnings and cash flow of equity market declines as a result of this guarantee 
in the event of an immediate decline of in gmab and gmwb contractholders account values as of december   due to equity market declines  there would be no net impact on our earnings because these benefits are hedged  however the reserve for gmabs and gmwbs would be increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition to our gmdb  gmib and gmab equity risk  at december  and we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in equity indexed annuity liabilities that provide customers with interest crediting rates based on the performance of the s p we hedge the equity risk associated with these liabilities through the purchase and sale of equity indexed options and futures  swap futures  and eurodollar futures  maintaining risk within specified value at risk limits 
allstate financial also is exposed to equity risk in dac 
fluctuations in the value of the variable annuity and life contract account values due to the equity market affect dac amortization  because the expected fee income and guaranteed benefits payable are components of the egp for variable annuity and life contracts 
for a more detailed discussion of dac  see note of the consolidated financial statements and the application of critical accounting policies section of the md a 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments  including real estate funds and our canadian operations 
we also have funding agreement programs and a small amount of fixed income securities that are denominated in foreign currencies  but we use derivatives to effectively hedge the foreign currency risk of these funding agreements and securities 
at december  and  we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  in funding agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had approximately million in foreign currency denominated equity securities and an additional million net investment in our canadian subsidiaries 
these amounts were million and million  respectively  at december  the foreign currency exposure is almost entirely in the property liability business 
based upon the information and assumptions we used at december   we estimate that a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would decrease the value of our foreign currency denominated instruments by approximately million  compared with an estimated million decrease at december  the selection of a immediate decrease in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
our currency exposure is diversified across countries  compared to countries at december  our largest individual currency exchange exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the euro 
the largest individual currency exchange exposures at december  were to the canadian dollar and the british pound 
our primary regional exposure is to western europe  approximately at december   compared to at december  the modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates 
even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by  we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios 
our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee 
pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans  which cover most full time and certain part time employees and employee agents 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements 
as provided for in statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  the market related value component of expected returns recognizes plan equity losses and gains over a five year period  which we believe is consistent with the long term nature of pension obligations 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our net periodic pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
net periodic pension cost in is estimated to be million based on current assumptions 
net periodic pension cost increased in and principally due to decreases in the weighted average discount rate assumption which is based on long term interest rates  the impact of unfavorable investment returns from prior periods on the market related value of assets  and the amortization of actuarial losses 
in each of the years  and  net pension cost included non cash settlement charges primarily resulting from lump sum distributions made to agents 
settlement charges are expected to continue in the future as we settle our remaining agent pension obligations by making lump sum distributions to agents 
amounts recorded for pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are significantly affected by fluctuations in the returns on plan assets and the amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses 
plan assets sustained net losses in prior periods primarily due to declines in equity markets 
these asset losses  combined with all other unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  resulted in amortization of net actuarial loss and additional net periodic pension cost of million in and million in we anticipate that the unrealized loss for our pension plans will exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets during the foreseeable future  resulting in additional amortization and net periodic pension cost 
amounts recorded for net periodic pension cost and minimum pension liabilities are also significantly affected by changes in the assumptions used to determine the weighted average discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the weighted average discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date 
we develop the assumed weighted average discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from bonds available in the lehman corporate bond universe having ratings of at least aa by standard poor s or at least aa by moody s on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements 
significant changes in discount rates  such as those caused by changes in the yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments  may result in volatility in pension cost and minimum pension liabilities 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would result in an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and an billion increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october   our most recent measurement date  versus an increase of million in net periodic pension cost and a million increase in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the weighted average discount rate would decrease net periodic pension cost by million and would decrease the minimum pension liability after tax by million as of october   versus a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million and a million decrease in the minimum pension liability after tax as of october  this non symmetrical range results from the non linear relationship between discount rates and pension obligations  and changes in the amortization of unrealized net actuarial gains and losses 
we made contributions during sufficient to eliminate a minimum pension liability for one of our qualified pension plans 
the minimum pension liability reported at december  relates solely to our unfunded non qualified pension plans 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets 
while this rate reflects long term assumptions and is consistent with long term historical returns  sustained changes in the market or changes in the mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are a component of unrecognized gains or losses  which may be amortized as a component of net actuarial gains and losses 
as a result  the effect of changes in fair value on our pension cost may be experienced in periods subsequent to those in which the fluctuations actually occur 
holding other assumptions constant  a hypothetical decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase of million in pension cost at october   compared to an increase of million at october  a hypothetical increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease in net periodic pension cost of million at october   compared to a decrease of million at october  changes in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets do not affect the minimum pension liability 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources consist of shareholders equity and debt  representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes 
the following table summarizes our capital resources at december in millions common stock  retained earnings and other shareholders equity items accumulated other comprehensive income    total shareholders equity    debt    total capital resources    ratio of debt to shareholders equity ratio of debt to capital resources shareholders equity declined in  due to net income being offset by share repurchases  decreases in unrealized net capital gains on investments and dividends paid to shareholders

we have reissued million shares since  primarily associated with our equity incentive plans  the acquisition of american heritage life investment corporation ahl and the redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
debt decreased in primarily due to decreases in long term debt partially offset by increased commercial paper borrowings

as a result of the liquidation  long term debt decreased by million 
we plan to use existing sources of liquidity to fund the repayment of our million senior notes due in debt increased in primarily due to increases in long term borrowings outstanding 
we issued million of senior notes due in  utilizing the registration statement filed with the sec in june the proceeds of this issuance were used for general corporate purposes  including to facilitate the repayment of a portion of the million of senior notes due at their scheduled maturity on may  the increase in debt was partially offset by a decrease of million related to the deconsolidation of a vie resulting from the sale of a portion of the equity interest in the vie

these groups maintain separate group ratings and are not reinsured by other allstate subsidiaries that are not part of these respective groups

the formula for calculating rbc for life insurance companies takes into account factors relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
at december   the rbc for each of our domestic insurance companies was above levels that would require regulatory actions 
the naic has also developed a set of financial relationships or tests known as the insurance regulatory information system to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by insurance regulatory authorities 
the naic analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios  each with defined usual ranges 
generally  regulators will begin to monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios 
if an insurance company has insufficient capital  regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue 
the ratios of our domestic insurance companies are within these ranges

for a description of limitations on the payment of these dividends  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
based on this limitation  without the prior approval from the illinois department of insurance  aic will not pay dividends to the allstate corporation until the third quarter of we expect that aic will have sufficient liquidity to pay estimated catastrophe claims and claims expenses from existing sources of funds including operating cash flows  proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and maturities and sales of investments 
we expect the loss reserves from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma to be paid during allstate financial higher operating cash flows for allstate financial in  compared to  primarily related to higher investment income  partially offset by lower life and annuity premiums 
lower cash flows from operating activities in  compared to  were primarily due to lower premium collections and higher deferrable expenses paid  partially offset by lower policy and contract benefits paid and higher interest received on fixed income securities and mortgage loans

for quantification of the changes in contractholder funds  see the allstate financial segment section of the md a 
a portion of the allstate financial product portfolio  primarily fixed annuity and interest sensitive life insurance products  is subject to surrender and withdrawal at the discretion of contractholders 
the following table summarizes allstate financial s liabilities for these products by their contractual withdrawal provisions at december  approximately of these liabilities are subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustment 
in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal  subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments specified surrender charges  market value  subject to discretionary withdrawal without adjustments  total contractholder funds  includes billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than of the account balance 
approximately billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a day period during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment  including approximately billion of market value adjusted annuities with a period commencing during to ensure we have the appropriate level of liquidity in this segment  we perform actuarial tests on the impact to cash flows of policy surrenders and other actions under various scenarios 
depending upon the years in which certain policy types were sold with specific surrender provisions  the allstate financial cash flow could vary due to higher surrender of policies exiting their surrender charge periods 
corporate and other fluctuations in the corporate and other operating cash flows  were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements 
investing activities primarily relate to activity in the portfolio of kennett capital 
financing cash flows of the corporate and other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in short term debt  repayment of debt  proceeds from the issuance of debt  dividends to shareholders of the allstate corporation and share repurchases  therefore  financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities 
we have established external sources of short term liquidity that include a commercial paper program  lines of credit  dollar rolls and repurchase agreements 
in the aggregate  at december   these sources could provide over billion of additional liquidity 
for additional liquidity  we can also issue new insurance contracts  incur additional debt and sell assets from our investment portfolio 
the liquidity of our investment portfolio varies by type of investment 
for example  billion of privately placed corporate obligations that represent of the consolidated investment portfolio  and billion of mortgage loans that represent of the consolidated investment portfolio  generally are considered to be less liquid than many of our other types of investments  such as our us government and agencies  municipal and public corporate fixed income security portfolios 
the sources of liquidity for the allstate corporation include but are not limited to dividends from aic and billion of investments at kennett capital 
we have access to additional borrowing to support liquidity as follows a commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of billion to cover short term cash needs 
as of december   the remaining borrowing capacity was million  however  the outstanding balance fluctuates daily 
a five year revolving credit facility expiring in totaling billion to cover short term liquidity requirements 
this facility contains an increase provision that would make up to an additional million available for borrowing provided the increased portion could be fully syndicated at a later date among existing or new lenders 
although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement  the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior  unsecured  nonguaranteed long term debt 
there were no borrowings under this line of credit during the total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility 
the capacity to issue up to an additional billion of debt securities  equity securities  warrants for debt and equity securities  trust preferred securities  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units utilizing the shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august our only financial covenant exists with respect to our credit facility and our synthetic lease vie obligations 
the covenant requires that we not exceed a debt to capital resources ratio as defined in the agreements 
this ratio at december  was 
for quantification of the synthetic lease vie obligations  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
we closely monitor and manage our liquidity through long and short term planning that is integrated throughout the corporation  the business segments and investments 
allstate financial manages the duration of assets and related liabilities through its alm organization  using a dynamic process that addresses liquidity utilizing the investment portfolio  and components of the portfolio as appropriate  which is routinely subjected to stress testing 
allstate protection s underwriting cash transactions comprise millions of small transactions that make it possible to statistically determine reasonable expectations of patterns of liquidity  which are subject to volatility from unpredictable catastrophe losses 
property liability monitors the duration of its assets and liabilities and maintains a portfolio of highly liquid fixed income and equity securities  including short term investments  exchange traded common stock  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  and us government and government agency securities in order to address the variability of its cash flows 
discontinued lines and coverages liabilities are expected to be paid over many years and do not present a significant liquidity risk 
allstate financial and property liability also have access to funds from our commercial paper program 
certain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity 
those events and circumstances include  for example  a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses  a downgrade in our long term debt rating of a  a and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to non investment grade status of below baa bbb bb  a downgrade in aic s financial strength rating from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below baa bbb a  or a downgrade in alic s financial strength ratings from aa  aa and a from moody s  standard poor s and am best  respectively to below aa aa a 
the rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities  therefore  a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements   commercial paper contractholder funds     reserve for life contingent contract benefits   long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations pension obligations reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense other liabilities and accrued expenses   total contractual cash obligations    liabilities for collateral and repurchase agreements are typically fully secured with cash or marketable securities 
we manage our short term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business 
contractholder funds represent interest bearing liabilities arising from the sale of products such as interest sensitive life  fixed annuities  including immediate annuities without life contingencies  bank deposits and institutional products 
these amounts reflect estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders 
certain of these contracts  such as immediate annuities without life contingencies and institutional products  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to i policies or contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so and ii contracts where the timing of payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts  such as interest sensitive life and fixed deferred annuities  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts and bank deposits  the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until i the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death  or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as the surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  which is outside of the control of the company 
we have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  and estimated additional deposits for interest sensitive life contracts  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  for contractholder funds 
the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
the reserve for life contingent contract benefits relates primarily to traditional life and immediate annuities with life contingencies and reflects the present value of estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and contractholders 
immediate annuities with life contingencies include i contracts where we are currently making payments and will continue to do so until the occurrence of a specific event such as death and ii contracts where the timing of a portion of the payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts  such as traditional life and supplemental accident and health insurance  involve payment obligations where the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain 
for these contracts  the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until i the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death or illness  or ii the occurrence of a payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy or contract  which is outside of the control of the company 
we have estimated the timing of cash outflows related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality  morbidity  expenses  customer lapse and withdrawal activity  and renewal premium for life policies  which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments 
such cash outflows reflect adjustments for the estimated timing of mortality  retirement  and other appropriate factors  but are undiscounted with respect to interest 
as a result  the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion included in the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  for reserve for life contingent contract benefits 
the liability amount in the consolidated statements of financial position reflects the discounting for interest as well as adjustments for the timing of other factors as described above 
our payment obligations relating to long term debt  capital lease obligations  operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and pension obligations are managed within the structure of our intermediate to long term liquidity management program 
amount differs from the balance presented on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december  because the long term debt amount above includes interest 
pension obligations represent planned contributions to our pension plans 
reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims  including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns 
however  the timing of these payments may vary significantly from the amounts shown above  especially for those claims that have been incurred but not reported 
the reserve for property liability insurance claims and claims expense includes loss reserves related to asbestos and environmental claims as of december   of billion and million  respectively 
other liabilities primarily include accrued expenses and certain benefit obligations and claim payments and other checks outstanding 
certain of these long term liabilities are discounted with respect to interest  as a result the sum of the cash outflows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the corresponding liability amounts of billion 
balance sheet liabilities not included in the table above include unearned and advance premiums of billion and deferred income taxes of million 
these items were excluded as they do not meet the definition of a contractual liability as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts to third parties 
rather  they represent an accounting mechanism that allows us to present our financial statements on an accrual basis of accounting 
in addition  other liabilities of million were not included in the table above because they did not represent a contractual obligation or the amount and timing of their eventual payment was sufficiently uncertain 
our contractual commitments as of december  and the payments due by period are shown in the following table 
in millions total less than year years years over years other commitments conditional other commitments unconditional  total commitments  represents investment commitments such as private placements and mortgage loans 
we have agreements in place for services we conduct  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
all material inter company transactions have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation 
inter company transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required 
for a more detailed discussion of our off balance sheet arrangements  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
enterprise risk management risk management is primarily employed within the business unit where the risk is undertaken 
in addition  we have a senior management advisory committee called the enterprise risk council erc 
although the work of the erc is still evolving  it is responsible for assessing risks on an integrated basis across subsidiaries and various areas of responsibility within allstate 
in the vision of the erc  enterprise risk management erm is a disciplined  holistic  and interactive approach to risk that is conducted under an overall framework which provides additional factors when setting strategy across allstate identifies potential events that could have a significant impact on allstate manages risk consistent with allstate s risk appetite provides greater assurance of achieving allstate s objectives allows allstate to achieve a return commensurate with the risks taken effective risk management requires an infrastructure that includes appropriate policies  tolerances and limits  consistent erm practices which include risk identification  evaluation  prioritization  treatment and monitoring  and effective communication and reporting 
managers in the various business units are responsible for managing  measuring  and evaluating risks as appropriate in their respective areas and that are within the risk appetite of the overall enterprise 
this would include items such as establishing risk oversight committees that develop and monitor appropriate tolerances and the measurement of exposure to any catastrophe  managing the impacts to invested assets and liabilities related to changes in interest rates and equity markets through value at risk  duration and convexity metrics  and evaluating risks related to credit exposures through a credit value at risk measurement 
as appropriate  consistent enterprise wide measurement standards are applied to these key risks and are integrated into such processes as strategic and financial planning and capital management 
for allstate protection  we are utilizing an internally developed stochastic model as a significant component in our determination of an appropriate level of economic capital needed  given a defined tolerance for risk 
economic capital modeling capabilities enable us to more fully understand and optimize risk reward tradeoffs across the portfolio of businesses 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature and interaction of the risks inherent in our business 
future plans include adding to the model similar economic capital evaluations with respect to the allstate financial business unit and at a consolidated level so that there is a total enterprise capability 
regulation and legal proceedings we are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions  all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business 
for a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pending accounting standards as of december   there are several pending and proposed accounting standards that we have not implemented either because the standard has not been finalized or the implementation date has not yet occurred 
for a discussion of these pending and proposed standards  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation 
for this reason  we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them 
forward looking statements and risk factors this document contains forward looking statements that anticipate results based on our estimates  assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty 
these statements are made subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments 
these forward looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like plans  seeks  expects  will  should  anticipates  estimates  intends  believes  likely  targets and other words with similar meanings 
these statements may address  among other things  our strategy for growth  product development  regulatory approvals  market position  expenses  financial results  litigation and reserves 
we believe that these statements are based on reasonable estimates  assumptions and plans 
however  if the estimates  assumptions or plans underlying the forward looking statements prove inaccurate or if other risks or uncertainties arise  actual results could differ materially from those communicated in these forward looking statements 
factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such forward looking statements include but are not limited to those discussed or identified in this document including the risks described below and in our public filings with the sec 
in addition to the normal risks of business  we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including those listed below  which apply to us as an insurer and a provider of other financial services 
risks relating to the property liability business as a property and casualty insurer  we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events because of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events  our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man made disasters  including earthquakes  volcanoes  wildfires  tornadoes  hurricanes  tropical storms and terrorism 
we may continue to incur catastrophe losses in our homeowners insurance business in amounts in excess of those experienced this year  in excess of those that management projects would be incurred based on hurricane and earthquake losses which have a one percent probability of occurring on an annual aggregate countrywide basis  and in excess of those that modelers estimate would be incurred based on other levels of probability and in excess of our current reinsurance coverage limits 
while we believe that our natural event catastrophe management initiatives will reduce the potential magnitude of possible future natural event losses  we continue to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse effect on operating results and financial position 
for example  our historical catastrophe experience includes losses relating to hurricane katrina in totaling billion  hurricane andrew in totaling billion  and the northridge earthquake of totaling billion 
we are also exposed to assessments from the cea  and various state created catastrophe loss management facilities  and to losses that could surpass the capitalization of these facilities 
our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe  or multiple catastrophes  which result in extraordinary losses or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings 
in addition  we are also subject to claims arising from weather events such as winter storms  rain  hail and high winds 
the incidence and severity of weather conditions are inherently unpredictable 
there is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of auto and homeowners claims when severe weather conditions occur 
the nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted although  along with others in the industry  we use models developed by third party vendors in assessing our personal lines homeowners exposure to catastrophe losses that assume various conditions and probability scenarios  such models do not necessarily accurately predict future losses or accurately measure losses currently incurred 
catastrophe models  which have been evolving since the early s  use historical information about hurricanes and earthquakes and also utilize detailed information about our in force business 
while we use this information in connection with our pricing and risk management activities  there are limitations with respect to their usefulness in predicting losses in any reporting period 
examples of these limitations are significant variations in estimates between models and modelers and material increases and decreases in model results due to changes and refinements of the underlying data elements and assumptions which lead to questionable predictive capability  and post event measurements that have not been well understood or proven to be sufficiently reliable 
in addition  the models are not necessarily reflective of company or state specific policy language  demand surge and loss adjustment expenses and the occurrence of mold losses  which are subject to wide variation by storm 
impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth we believe that the actions we are taking to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce the variability in our earnings  while providing quality protection to our customers  will be successful over the long term  however it is possible that they will have a negative impact on near term growth and earnings 
homeowners premium growth rates and retention will be adversely impacted by adjustments to our business structure  size and underwriting practices in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure 
in addition  due to reduced cross selling opportunities  new business growth in our auto lines could be lower than expected 
unanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability changes in the severity or frequency of claims may affect the profitability of our allstate protection segment 
changes in bodily injury claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy 
changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
changes in homeowner s claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry  in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors  including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by hurricanes 
however  changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation in these various sectors of the economy 
increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict 
examples of such events include a decision in by the georgia supreme court that diminished value coverage was included in auto policies under georgia law  and the emergence of mold related homeowners losses in the state of texas during although from time to time we pursue various loss management initiatives in the allstate protection segment in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity 
our allstate protection segment has experienced a decline in claim frequency 
other participants in the industry have also experienced a similar decline 
we believe that this decrease may be attributable to a combination of several factors  including an increase in the level of policy deductibles chosen by policyholders  a decrease in policyholder submission of claims for minor losses  and our implementation of improved underwriting criteria 
the favorable level of claim frequency we have experienced may not be sustainable over the longer term 
a significant increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
actual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims recorded claim reserves in the property liability business are based on our best estimates of losses  both reported and ibnr  after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances 
internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases  actual claims paid  historical trends involving claim payment patterns  pending levels of unpaid claims  loss management programs  product mix  and contractual terms 
external factors are also considered which include but are not limited to law changes  court decisions  changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions 
because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred  including ibnr losses  the establishment of appropriate reserves  including reserves for catastrophes  is an inherently uncertain and complex process 
the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
management believes the estimated claim reserves related to hurricanes katrina  rita  and wilma are appropriately established and recorded based on available facts  information  laws and regulations 
however  actual results may differ materially from the amounts recorded for a variety of reasons our policyholders ability to report and our ability to adjust claims were impeded by the extent of the devastation  the size of the area affected  and the fact that some communities were hit by more than one storm  it is particularly difficult to assess the extent of damage in the initial stages of adjusting residential property losses  our estimate for the ultimate costs of repairs may not prove to be correct because of increased demand for services and supplies in the areas affected by a hurricane  the number of ibnr claims may be greater or less than anticipated  the need to have more claims adjusters to handle the large number of claims has increased pressure on our catastrophe claims settlement management process  and litigation has been filed  which if ultimately decided against us  could lead to a material increase in our catastrophe claims and claims expense estimate 
losses from catastrophes on policies allstate sells and administers as a participant in the nfip program are reported in our reserves for claims and claims expense and in our reinsurance recoverable 
since the level of nfip claim activity that we experienced in is unprecedented  in subsequent fiscal quarters we may need to increase the amount of ibnr and related reinsurance recoverable 
however  because the federal government is responsible for paying all such claims  we do not expect that any such increases will affect net income or shareholders equity 
additionally  the expense allowances we receive from nfip may ultimately be determined to be either insufficient to meet our incremental expense or may prove to be in excess of such expense 
predicting claim expense relating to asbestos and other environmental and discontinued lines is inherently uncertain the process of estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning  among other things  the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are  or were ever intended to be  covered  and whether losses could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium  reinsurance or other contractual agreements 
asbestos related bankruptcies and other asbestos litigations are complex  lengthy proceedings that involve substantial uncertainty for insurers 
while we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating asbestos  environmental and other discontinued lines net loss reserves  these refinements may subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss 
consequently  ultimate net losses from these discontinued lines could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries  and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  operating results and financial position 
regulation limiting rate increases and requiring us to underwrite business and participate in loss sharing arrangements may decrease our profitability from time to time  political events and positions affect the insurance market  including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability 
for example  when allstate protection s loss ratio compares favorably to that of the industry  state regulatory authorities may resist or delay our efforts to raise rates in the future even if the property and casualty industry generally is not experiencing regulatory resistance to rate increases  impose rate rollbacks or require us to pay premium refunds to policyholders 
such resistance affects our ability in all product lines to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity 
our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for its cost 
in addition to regulating rates  certain states have enacted laws that require a property liability insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans  reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations or require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers  often restricting an insurer s ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge 
in these markets  we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower than desired rates  possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity 
laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer s ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance in the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
additionally  certain states require insurers to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state 
our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors 
we are subject to assessments from state insurance facilities we are currently monitoring developments with respect to various state facilities such as guaranty funds  la citizens  fl citizens  the mississippi windstorm underwriting association  the mississippi residential underwriting association  the alabama insurance underwriting association  the texas fair plan association and the texas windstorm insurance association 
the ultimate impact of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma on these facilities is currently uncertain  but could result in the facilities recognizing a financial deficit or a financial deficit greater than the level currently estimated 
they may  in turn  have the ability to assess participating insurers when financial deficits occur  adversely affecting our results of operations 
these facilities are generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders 
allstate and other insurance companies writing residential property policies in florida  including fl citizens  must participate in the fhcf  which potentially reimburses companies for their qualifying losses at various participating percentages above required retention levels subject to maximum reimbursement amounts 
allstate and these other companies currently have reimbursement recoverable balances from the fhcf for the and hurricane losses in florida 
if the fhcf does not have sufficient funds to pay its ultimate reimbursement obligations  it has the authority to issue bonds 
such bonds are funded by assessments on all property and casualty premiums in the state  except workers compensation  medical malpractice and accident and health insurance 
by law  these assessments are the obligation of insurance policyholders which insurance companies must collect 
companies are required to collect the fhcf assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit them to the fhcf as they are collected 
the exposure to assessments and the availability of recoupments or premium rate increases from these facilities may not offset each other in the company s financial statements 
moreover  even if they do offset each other  they may not offset each other in financial statements for the same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases  as well as the possibility of policies not being renewed in subsequent years 
the potential benefits of implementing tiered pricing may not be fully realized we believe that tiered pricing and underwriting including srm which  in some situations  considers information that is obtained from credit reports among other factors has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably 
however  because some of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and tiered pricing models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit  we may lose our competitive advantage 
further  the use of insurance scoring from information that is obtained from credit reports as a factor in underwriting and pricing has at times been challenged by regulators  legislators  litigants and special interest groups in various states 
competitive pressures could also force us to modify our tiered pricing model 
furthermore  because we have been using tiered pricing only for the last several years  we can not be assured that tiered pricing models will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the mix of new business generated 
moreover  to the extent that competitive pressures limit our ability to attract new customers  our expectation that the amount of business written using tiered pricing will increase may not be realized 
allstate protection may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition  less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates  followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition  more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates 
a downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks relating to the allstate financial segment changes in underwriting and actual experience could materially affect profitability our product pricing includes long term assumptions regarding investment returns  mortality  morbidity  persistency and operating costs and expenses of the business 
management establishes target returns for each product based upon these factors and the average amount of capital that the company must hold to support in force contracts  satisfy rating agencies and meet regulatory requirements 
we monitor and manage our pricing and overall sales mix to achieve target returns on a portfolio basis 
profitability from new business emerges over a period of years depending on the nature and life of the product and is subject to variability as actual results may differ from pricing assumptions 
our profitability in this segment depends on the adequacy of investment margins  the management of market and credit risks associated with investments  our ability to maintain premiums and contract charges at a level adequate to cover mortality and morbidity benefits  the adequacy of contract charges on variable contracts to cover the costs of various product features  the persistency of policies to ensure recovery of acquisition expenses  and the management of operating costs and expenses within anticipated pricing allowances 
legislation and regulation of the insurance marketplace and products could also affect our profitability 
changes in reserve estimates may reduce profitability reserve for life contingent contract benefits is computed on the basis of long term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields  mortality  morbidity  policy terminations and expenses 
we periodically review the adequacy of these reserves on an aggregate basis and if future experience differs significantly from assumptions  adjustments to reserves may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
changes in market interest rates may lead to a significant decrease in the sales and profitability of spread based products our ability to manage the allstate financial investment margin for spread based products  such as fixed annuities and institutional products  is dependent upon maintaining profitable spreads between investment yields and interest crediting rates 
as interest rates decrease or remain at low levels  proceeds from investments that have matured  prepaid or been sold may be reinvested at lower yields  reducing investment margin 
lowering interest crediting rates can offset decreases in investment margin on some products 
however  these changes could be limited by market conditions  regulatory or contractual minimum rate guarantees on many contracts and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields 
decreases in the rates offered on products in the financial segment could make those products less attractive  leading to lower sales and or changes in the level of surrenders and withdrawals for these products 
non parallel shifts in interest rates  such as increases in short term rates without accompanying increases in medium and long term rates  can influence customer demand for fixed annuities  which could impact the level and profitability of new customer deposits 
increases in market interest rates can also have negative effects on allstate financial  for example by increasing the attractiveness of other investments to our customers  which can lead to higher surrenders at a time when the segment s fixed income investment asset values are lower as a result of the increase in interest rates 
for certain products  principally fixed annuity and interest sensitive life products  the earned rate on assets could lag behind market yields 
we may react to market conditions by increasing crediting rates  which could narrow spreads 
unanticipated surrenders could result in dac unlocking or affect the recoverability of dac and thereby increase expenses and reduce profitability 
declining equity markets may reduce both sales of products and income from contract charges and may adversely affect operating results and financial condition conditions in the domestic and international stock markets affect the sale and profitability of allstate financial s variable annuities 
in general  sales of variable annuities decrease when stock markets are declining over an extended period of time 
the effect of decreasing separate accounts balances resulting from volatile equity markets  lower underlying fund performance or declining consumer confidence could cause contract charges earned to decrease 
in addition  it is possible that the assumptions and projections we use to establish prices for gmdb  gmib  gmab and gmwb products  particularly assumptions and projections about investment performance  do not accurately reflect the level of costs that we will ultimately incur in providing those benefits  resulting in adverse margin trends 
these factors may result in accelerated dac amortization and require increases in reserves  which would reduce statutory capital and surplus and or allstate financial s net income 
poor fund performance could also result in higher partial withdrawals of account value which  for some contracts  do not reduce the gmdb by a proportional amount 
changes in estimates of profitability on interest sensitive life  fixed and variable annuities and other investment products may have an adverse effect on results through increased amortization of dac dac related to interest sensitive life  fixed and variable annuities and other investment contracts is amortized in proportion to agp and egp over the estimated lives of the contracts 
assumptions underlying egp  including those relating to margins from mortality  investment margin  contract administration  surrender and other contract charges  are updated from time to time in order to reflect actual and expected experience and its potential effect on the valuation of dac 
updates to these assumptions could result in dac unlocking  which in turn could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
a loss of key product distribution relationships could materially affect sales certain products in the allstate financial segment are distributed under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not affiliated with us 
termination of one or more of these agreements due to  for example  a change in control of one of these distributors  could have a detrimental effect on the sales of allstate financial 
changes in tax laws may decrease sales and profitability of products under current federal and state income tax law  certain products we offer  primarily life insurance and annuities  receive favorable tax treatment 
this favorable treatment may give certain of our products a competitive advantage over noninsurance products 
congress from time to time considers legislation that would reduce or eliminate the favorable policyholder tax treatment currently applicable to life insurance and annuities 
congress also considers proposals to reduce the taxation of certain products or investments that may compete with life insurance and annuities 
legislation that increases the taxation on insurance products or reduces the taxation on competing products could lessen the advantage or create a disadvantage for certain of our products making them less competitive 
such proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or ability to sell such products and could result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies 
in addition  changes in the federal estate tax laws could negatively affect the demand for the types of life insurance used in estate planning 
actions taken to simplify our business model and improve profitability may not be successful and may result in losses and costs allstate financial is pursuing strategies intended to improve its return on equity 
actions that we have taken and may continue to take include changing the number and selection of products being marketed  terminating underperforming distribution relationships  merging or disposing of unnecessary and or non strategic legal entities  reducing policy administration software systems  and other actions that we may determine are appropriate to successfully execute our business strategies 
the actions that we have taken and may take in the future may not achieve their intended outcome and could result in lower premiums and contract charges  restructuring costs  losses on disposition or losses related to the discontinuance of individual products or distribution relationships 
risks relating to the insurance industry our future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive the insurance industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include other insurers and  because many of our products include a savings or investment component  securities firms  investment advisers  mutual funds  banks and other financial institutions 
many of our competitors have well established national reputations and market similar products 
because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry  including competition for producers such as exclusive and independent agents  there can be no assurance that we will continue to effectively compete with our industry rivals  or that competitive pressure will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
the ability of banks to affiliate with insurers may have a material adverse effect on all of our product lines by substantially increasing the number  size and financial strength of potential competitors 
furthermore  certain competitors operate using a mutual insurance company structure and therefore  may have dissimilar profitability and return targets 
we are subject to market risk and declines in credit quality we are subject to market risk  the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity  interest  commodity or foreign currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates and equity prices and  to a lesser degree  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
for additional information on market risk  see the market risk section of md a 
a decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new investments that may yield less than the portfolio s average rate 
in a declining interest rate environment  borrowers may prepay or redeem securities more quickly than expected as they seek to refinance at lower rates 
a decline could also cause the purchase of longer term assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities 
an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial majority of our investment portfolio 
increases in interest rates also may lead to an increase in policy loans  surrenders and withdrawals that generally would be funded at a time when fair values of fixed income securities are lower 
a declining equity market could also cause the investments in our pension plans to decrease below the accumulated benefit obligation  resulting in additional pension liability and expense and increasing required contributions to the pension plans 
a decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities  including realized losses relating to derivative strategies not adequately addressing portfolio risks 
concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular segment of the economy may have adverse effects the concentration of our investment portfolios in any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic sector could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolios and consequently on our results of operations and financial position 
while we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly diversified portfolio  events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry  group of related industries or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated rather than diversified 
we may suffer losses from litigation as is typical for a large company  we are involved in a substantial amount of litigation  including class action litigation challenging a range of company practices 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and may be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular quarter or annual period 
for a description of our current legal proceedings  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
in some circumstances  we may be able to collect on third party insurance that we carry to recover all or part of the amounts that we pay in judgments  settlements and litigation expenses 
however  we may not be able to resolve issues concerning the availability  if any  or the ability to collect such insurance concurrently with the underlying litigation 
consequently  the timing of the resolution of a particular piece of litigation and the determination of our insurance recovery with respect to that litigation may not coincide and  therefore  may be reflected in our financial statements in different fiscal quarters 
we are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth as insurance companies  broker dealers  investment advisers and or investment companies  many of our subsidiaries are subject to extensive laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and subject to change 
moreover  they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities  including state insurance regulators  state securities administrators  the sec  the national association of securities dealers  the us department of justice  and state attorneys general  each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of the same issue  particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight 
in addition  there is risk that any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment  or that changes in the overall legal environment may  even absent any particular regulator s or enforcement authority s interpretation of a legal issue changing  cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective  thus necessitating changes to our practices that may  in some cases  limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
furthermore  in some cases  these laws and regulations are designed to protect the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies 
for example  state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect purchasers or users of insurance products  not holders of securities issued by the allstate corporation 
in many respects  these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of congress have discussed proposals to provide for optional federal chartering of insurance companies 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation 
reinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices  which may limit our ability to write new business market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase 
no assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available 
if we were unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable  we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk  reduce our insurance writings  or develop or seek other alternatives 
reinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors  including whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract and whether reinsurers  or their affiliates  have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract 
our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may adversely affect the level of claim losses we incur and the value of our investment portfolio the continued threat of terrorism  both within the united states and abroad  and ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats  may cause significant volatility and losses from declines in the equity markets and from interest rate changes in the united states  europe and elsewhere  and result in loss of life  property damage  additional disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by the continued threat of terrorism 
we seek to mitigate the potential impact of terrorism on our commercial mortgage portfolio by limiting geographical concentrations in key metropolitan areas and by requiring terrorism insurance to the extent that it is commercially available 
additionally  in the event that a terrorist act occurs  both allstate protection and allstate financial could be adversely affected  depending on the nature of the event 
any decrease in our financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our competitive position financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company s business 
on an ongoing basis  rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer s ratings due to  for example  a change in an insurer s statutory capital  a change in a rating agency s determination of the amount of risk adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating  an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer s investment portfolio  a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be under the insurer s control 
the insurance financial strength ratings of both aic and alic are a  aa and aa from am best  standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
several other affiliates have been assigned their own financial strength ratings by one or more rating agencies 
because all of these ratings are subject to continuous review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
a multiple level downgrade in any of these ratings could have a material adverse effect on our sales  our competitiveness  the marketability of our product offerings  and our liquidity  operating results and financial condition 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb 
it is possible that future changes we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition 
for a description of potential changes in accounting standards that could affect us currently  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations the allstate corporation is a holding company with no significant operations 
the principal asset is the stock of its subsidiaries 
as a result of the capital support agreement with aic  in certain circumstances it could be compelled in to make a capital contribution that would be completed out of the allstate corporation s available sources of liquidity 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements affect the ability of the subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to shareholders  service our debt and complete repurchase programs in the timeframe expected 
the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively in the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe  an industrial accident  a terrorist attack or war  events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition  particularly if those events affect our computer based data processing  transmission  storage and retrieval systems 
in the event that a significant number of our managers could be unavailable in the event of a disaster  our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised
