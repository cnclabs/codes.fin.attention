item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those under the heading factors that may affect our future performance 
regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other provisions of the securities exchange act of  as amended  define and prescribe the conditions for the use of certain non gaap financial information 
in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we provide information regarding growth in product revenues excluding recently acquired product lines  which is a non gaap financial measure 
a reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to the most comparable gaap measure is provided in this annual report 
this non gaap financial measure should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 
management believes that this non gaap financial measure constitutes important supplemental information to investors which reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations  provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our ongoing business and operations 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirely and to not rely on any single financial measure 
because non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names 
general integra is a market leading  innovative medical device company focused on helping the medical professional enhance the standard of care for patients 
integra provides customers with clinically relevant  innovative and cost effective products that improve the quality of life for patients 
we focus on cranial and spinal procedures  peripheral nerve repair  small bone and joint injuries  and the repair and reconstruction of soft tissue 
our distribution channels include two direct sales organizations integra neurosciences and integra reconstructive surgery  one network of manufacturer s representatives managed by a direct sales organization jarit surgical instruments and strategic alliances with market leaders such as johnson johnson  medtronic  inc  wyeth and zimmer holdings  inc 
we have direct sales forces in the united states  germany  the united kingdom  the benelux belgium  netherlands  luxembourg region and france 
elsewhere throughout the world  our products are distributed through a number of independent distributors 
we invest substantial resources and management effort to develop our sales organizations  and we believe that we compete very effectively in this aspect of our business 
our product groups include instruments  implants  monitoring products  and private label products 
our instruments product group includes ultrasonic surgery systems for tissue ablation  cranial stabilization and brain retraction systems  and instrumentation used in general  neurosurgical  spinal and plastic and reconstructive surgery 
our implants product group includes dural grafts that are indicated for the repair of the dura mater  dermal regeneration and engineered wound dressings  and implants used in small bone and joint fixation  repair of peripheral nerves  and hydrocephalus management 
our monitoring products group includes systems for the measurement of various brain parameters and devices used to gain access to the cranial cavity and to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles of the brain 
our private label product group includes implants used in bone regeneration and in guided tissue regeneration in periodontal surgery 
we manufacture many of our implant  monitoring and private label products in various plants located in the united states  puerto rico  france  the united kingdom and germany 
we also manufacture the ultrasonic surgical instruments and source most of our hand held surgical instruments through specialized third party vendors 
we believe that we have a particular advantage in the development  manufacture and sale of specialty tissue repair products derived from bovine collagen 
we develop and manufacture these products primarily in our facility in plainsboro  new jersey 
taken together  these products accounted for approximately  and of product revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we manage these multiple product groups and distribution channels on a centralized basis 
accordingly  we report our financial results under a single operating segment the development  manufacturing and distribution of medical devices 
our objective is to continue to build a customer focused and profitable medical device company by developing or acquiring innovative medical devices and other products to sell through our sales channels 
our strategy therefore entails substantial growth in product revenues both through internal means through launching new and innovative products and selling existing products more intensively and by acquiring existing businesses or already successful product lines 
we aim to achieve this growth in revenues while maintaining strong financial results 
while we pay attention to any meaningful trend in our financial results  we pay particular attention to measurements that tend to support the view that our profitability can grow for a period of years 
these measurements include revenue growth  derived through acquisitions and products developed internally  gross margins on products revenues  which we aim to increase to more than over a period of several years  operating margins  which we aim to continually expand on as we leverage our existing infrastructure  and earnings per fully diluted share of common stock 
acquisitions our strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies 
our recent acquisitions of businesses  assets and product lines may make our financial results for the year ended december  not directly comparable to those of the corresponding prior year periods 
since the beginning of  we have acquired the following businesses  assets and product lines in march  integra acquired the assets of the radionics division of tyco healthcare group  lp for approximately million in cash  subject to certain adjustments 
radionics  based in burlington  massachusetts  is a leader in the design  manufacture and sale of advanced minimally invasive medical instruments in the fields of neurosurgery and radiation therapy 
radionics products include the cusa excel r ultrasonic surgical aspiration system  the crw r stereotactic system  the xknife r stereotactic radiosurgery system  and the omnisight r excel image guided surgery system 
tyco healthcare sold the radionics products in over countries  using a network of independent distributors in the united states and both independent distributors and tyco healthcare affiliates internationally 
we are likely to use distributors in many of the markets in which tyco healthcare sold direct 
as a result  we expect that revenue and pre tax income attributable to the acquired product lines will be reduced from the reported levels 
in addition  because the cusa excel ultrasonic aspiration system competes with our existing line of ultrasonic surgery systems  our sales force may  in some situations  sell the cusa system in lieu of our existing ultrasonic aspirator products 
overall  the acquired business has been growing at rates below our corporate growth rate targets 
in september  we acquired the intellectual property estate of eunoe  inc for million in cash 
prior to ceasing operations  eunoe  inc was engaged in the development of its innovative cognishunt r system for the treatment of alzheimer s disease patients 
the acquired intellectual property has not been developed into a product that has been approved or cleared by the fda and has no future alternative use other than in clinical applications involving the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid 
accordingly  we recorded the entire acquisition price as an in process research and development charge in in january  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of newdeal technologies sas 
we paid million million euros in cash at closing  a million working capital adjustment paid in january  and million of acquisition related expenses 
newdeal is a leading developer and marketer of specialty implants and instruments specifically designed for foot and ankle surgery 
newdeal s products include a wide range of products for the forefoot  the mid foot and the hind foot  including the bold r screw  hallu fix r plate system and the hintegra r total ankle prosthesis 
at the time of the acquisition  newdeal sold its products through a direct sales force in france  belgium and the netherlands  and through distributors in more than countries  including the united states and canada 
during  we began to market the newdeal products directly in the united states through our integra reconstructive surgery sales force 
newdeal s target physicians include orthopedic surgeons specializing in injuries of the foot  ankle and extremities  as well as podiatric surgeons 
in may  we acquired the mayfield r cranial stabilization and positioning systems and the budde r halo retractor system business from schaerer mayfield usa  inc formerly ohio medical instrument company for million in cash paid at closing  a million working capital adjustment and million of acquisition related expenses 
the mayfield r and budde r lines include skull clamps  headrests  reusable and disposable skull pins  blades  retractor systems and spinal implants 
mayfield systems are the market leader in the united states and have been used by neurosurgeons for over thirty years 
the products are sold in the united states through our integra neurosciences tm direct sales organization and in international markets through distributors 
in may  we acquired all of the capital stock of berchtold medizin elektronik gmbh  now named integra me gmbh  from berchtold holding gmbh for million in cash 
integra me manufactures and markets the elektrotom r line of electrosurgery generators and the sonotom r ultrasonic surgical aspirator  as well as a broad line of related handpieces  instruments and disposables used in many surgical procedures  including neurosurgery 
in january  we acquired two small instruments businesses the r b instrument business from r b surgical solutions  llc for million in cash and the sparta disposable critical care devices and surgical instruments business from fleetwood medical  inc for million in cash 
the r b instrument line is a complete line of high quality handheld surgical instruments used in neuro and spinal surgery 
the sparta product line includes products used in plastic and reconstructive  ear  nose and throat ent  neuro  ophthalmic and general surgery 
in december  we acquired the assets of reconstructive technologies  inc for million in cash and an agreement to make future payments based on product sales 
reconstructive technologies was the developer of the automated cyclic expansion system ace system tm  a tissue expansion device 
as the ace system was not yet approved for sale  we recorded a million in process research and development charge in connection with this acquisition 
we are evaluating the regulatory  engineering  and clinical efforts necessary to develop and launch the ace system 
restructuring activities during the second quarter of  we announced plans to restructure certain of our european operations 
the restructuring plan included closing our integra me production facility in tuttlingen  germany and reducing the manufacturing overhead workforce in our production facility located in biot  france  both of which were completed in december we transitioned the manufacturing operations of integra me to our production facility in andover  england 
during the second quarter of  we also eliminated some duplicative sales and marketing positions  primarily in europe 
approximately individuals were identified for termination under the european restructuring plan 
as of december   we terminated of these individuals 
in  we also completed the transfer of the spinal specialties assembly operations from our san antonio  texas plant to our san diego  california plant and we continue to transfer certain assembly  processing and packaging operations to our san diego and puerto rico facilities 
in connection with these restructuring activities  we recorded million of charges in for the estimated costs of employee termination benefits to be provided to the affected employees and related facility exit costs 
while we expect a positive impact of the restructuring and integration activities  such results remain uncertain 
we expect to reinvest most of the savings from these restructuring and integration activities in further expanding our european sales  marketing and distribution organization  and adding the newdeal group s business to our existing sales and distribution network 
results of operations net income in was million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in and net income of million  or per diluted share  in these amounts include the following charges in thousands charges involuntary employee termination costs  facility consolidation  acquisition integration and related costs  acquired in process research and development costs associated with discontinued products lines inventory fair market value purchase accounting adjustments  cash donation to the integra foundation  acquired technology licensing and milestone payments  tax charge incurred in connection with the reorganization of certain european operations 
 total    in  we recognized million of other income related to an unrealized gain on a foreign currency collar  which was used to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar as a result of our commitment to acquire newdeal technologies for million euros 
the foreign currency collar expired in january  concurrent with our acquisition of newdeal technologies 
we believe that  given our ongoing  active strategy of seeking acquisitions  our current focus on rationalizing our existing manufacturing and distribution infrastructure  and our recent review of various product lines in relation to our current business strategy  the charges and amounts recorded to other income discussed above could recur with similar materiality in the future 
we believe that the delineation of these costs provides useful information to measure the comparative performance of our business operations 
net income also includes the following amounts in  we recognized an additional million of royalty revenue related to a change in the manner we use to estimate royalties earned based on medtronic s sales of its infuse tm bone graft product 
prior to  we recognized this royalty revenue when wyeth paid us royalties because wyeth did not provide information to us about the royalty amount earned each quarter prior to us reporting our quarterly financial results and we did not have a reliable basis for otherwise estimating and recording royalty revenue in the same quarter it was earned 
however  we now receive quarterly royalty revenue information from wyeth more quickly  we have sufficient historical information available to help us estimate  and the volatility in the royalty earned each quarter has decreased significantly 
accordingly  we started recognizing this royalty on an accrual basis in the quarter earned 
in  we recognized a million non cash compensation charge related to the renewal of our chief executive officer s employment agreement 
in  we recorded million of other revenue related to the acceleration of the recognition of unused minimum purchase payments and unamortized license fee revenue from ethicon following the termination of the supply  distribution and collaboration agreement in december we also received a million payment from ethicon from the termination of our agreement with them  which is included in other income 
these amounts represent revenues  gains  and charges resulting from facts and circumstances that  based on our recent history and future expectations  are not expected to recur with similar materiality or impact on continuing operations 
we believe that the identification of these revenues  charges and gains that meet these criteria promotes comparability of reported financial results for the periods presented 
total revenues and gross margin on product revenues exclusive of amortization related to acquired intangible assets in thousands  except per share data monitoring products    implant products    instruments    private label products    total product revenues    other revenue   total revenues    cost of product revenues exclusive of amortization related to acquired intangible assets    gross margin on product revenues    gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in  total revenues increased over to million  led by a million  or  increase in product revenues to million 
domestic product revenues increased million in to million  or of total product revenues  as compared to and of product revenues in and  respectively 
sales of instruments and implant products  which reported a and increase  respectively  in sales over  led our growth in product revenues in in  total revenues increased over to million  led by a million  or  increase in product revenues to million 
domestic product revenues increased million in to million 
sales of instruments and implant products  which reported a and increase  respectively  in sales over  led our growth in product revenues in reported product revenues for and included the following amounts in revenues from acquired product lines revenues revenues change in thousands total product revenues products acquired during  n m products acquired during   n m all other product revenues   total product revenues   all of the products acquired in were added to the implants product group  while all of the products acquired in were added to the instrument product group 
product revenues excluding and acquisitions grew at for the year ended december  as compared to increased sales of our implant products used for skin replacement and wound dressings  dural repair  and repair and protection of peripheral nerves  our surgical instrumentation and ultrasonic surgery systems for tissue ablation  and revenues from our absorbable collagen sponge product sold to wyeth accounted for a significant portion of this growth 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant effect on the year over year increase in product revenues 
product revenues in and  included million and million  respectively  in sales of products acquired in either or increased sales of our implant products used for skin replacement and wound dressings and dural repair and increased revenues from our absorbable collagen sponge product sold to wyeth drove this revenue growth 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates in had a million favorable effect on the year over year increase in product revenues 
we have developed a new targeted account sales and marketing strategy for products in the monitoring category and expect that it will contribute to improvements in the performance of our monitoring products in future periods 
we have generated our product revenue growth through acquisitions  new product launches and increased direct sales and marketing efforts both domestically and in europe 
we expect that our expanded domestic sales force  the recent conversion of jarit domestic sales from a distributor billing model to a direct billing model  the continued implementation of our direct sales strategy in europe and sales of internally developed and acquired products will drive our future revenue growth 
we also intend to continue to acquire businesses that complement our existing businesses and products 
overall  we expect our revenues to continue to grow in the range of to per annum 
we expect organic revenue growth in excess of per annum 
gross margin as a percentage of product revenues exclusive of amortization related to acquired intangible assets was in  in and in cost of product revenues included million  million  and million in fair value inventory purchase accounting adjustments recorded in connection with acquisitions in  and  respectively 
our gross margin in was also negatively affected by million of termination costs incurred in connection with our european restructuring activities  million of charges associated with facility consolidations and million of charges associated with a discontinued product line 
continued growth in sales of higher margin products  including our skin replacement and wound dressing implants  dural repair implants  cranial stabilization systems  and recently acquired foot and ankle implant products offset the impact of the charges recorded in in  we expect our consolidated gross margin to increase 
we expect that sales of our higher gross margin products will continue to increase as a proportion of total product revenues 
also  we have begun to bill hospital customers directly for sales of jarit instruments to them  rather than distributors 
we expect that this will result in increased product revenues  a higher gross margin  and increased selling expenses 
we anticipate that the relatively lower gross margin generated from sales of radionics products will offset some of these benefits 
gross margins in improved as compared to as a result of increased sales of higher margin products  including our skin replacement and wound dressing implants and dural repair implants and the cranial stabilization systems acquired in  and from the negative impact of the million in fair value inventory purchase accounting adjustments recorded in other operating expenses the following is a summary of other operating expenses as a percent of total revenues research and development selling  general and administrative we reported in process research and development charges of million and million in and  respectively 
the million in process research and development charge in related to intellectual property acquired from eunoe  inc in september prior to ceasing operations  eunoe  inc was engaged in the development of its innovative cognishunt r system for the treatment of alzheimer s disease patients 
the acquisition of the eunoe intellectual property estate and clinical trial data extends integra s technology to regulate the flow of cerebrospinal fluid within the brain 
the acquired intellectual property has not been developed into a product that has been approved or cleared by the fda and has no future alternative use other than in clinical applications involving the regulation of cerebrospinal fluid 
research and development costs have continued to decline as a percentage of total revenue as we continue to restructure our research and development activities 
the percentage declines are also the result of significant increases in hand held instrument sales  which by their nature require less research and development expenditures compared to our other product lines 
in  our research and development expenses decreased million to million because of decreased development efforts related to our next generation ultrasonic aspirator and from the impact of the million milestone payment related to the completion of certain development activities for an advanced neuro monitoring system made in our research and development expenses increased million to million and included the million milestone payment and a million licensing fee paid for the development of a data acquisition system to support the integration of our advanced monitoring products 
in  we incurred million of expenses related to the consolidation of our san diego research center with our other facilities 
in  we expect our research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues to increase slightly as we increase expenditures on research and clinical activities directed toward expanding the indications for use of our absorbable implant technology products  including a multi center clinical trial suitable to support an application to the fda for approval of the duragen plus tm adhesion barrier matrix product in the united states 
the recently acquired radionics business also spends proportionately more on research and development 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval  based on management s judgment of probable future commercialization 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies or a decision by management to discontinue the related development program 
at december   we capitalized approximately million of pre approval inventory 
in  our selling  general and administrative expenses included a million share based compensation charge related to the renewal of our president and chief executive officer s employment agreement 
excluding the impact of this charge  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in because of the continued expansion of our direct sales and marketing organizations around all three direct selling platforms  increased corporate staff to support the recent growth in our business and costs associated with our restructuring  acquisition integration and systems implementation activities 
since  we have been investing resources in the implementation of a new global enterprise business system 
in and  we relocated and expanded most of our domestic and international distribution capabilities through third party service providers 
in  we recorded million of employee termination costs and million of charges associated with facility consolidations  acquisition integrations and related costs incurred in connection with our restructuring activities in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we do not expect that the costs to complete these activities in will be as significant  although there may be additional significant costs incurred to integrate the radionics business 
in  we also recorded million of selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the recently acquired newdeal businesses 
these costs included a million compensation charge related to the sellers obligation to continue their employment with integra through the end of in  we expect our selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue to increase as compared to as a result of the impact of expensing all share based compensation following the adoption of sfas no 
r and from higher commissions associated with the conversion of jarit domestic sales from a distributor billing model to a direct billing model 
amortization expense increased to million in because of amortization on intangible assets acquired through our business acquisitions 
including the impact of intangible assets acquired in the radionics acquisition  we expect annual amortization expense to be approximately million in  million in  million in  million in and million in non operating income and expenses in  we received approximately million of net proceeds from the sale of million of our contingent convertible subordinated notes due in march in   and  we recorded interest expense of million  million  and million  respectively  in connection with these notes  which was offset by million  million  and million  respectively  of interest income on our invested cash and marketable debt securities 
we will pay additional interest contingent interest on our convertible notes if  at thirty days prior to maturity  our common stock price is greater than per share 
we recorded a million liability related to the estimated fair value of the contingent interest obligation at the time the notes were issued 
the contingent interest obligation is marked to its fair value at each balance sheet date  with changes in the fair value recorded to interest expense 
at december   the estimated fair value of the contingent interest obligation was million 
in  interest expense associated with changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent interest obligation was not significant 
in  and  respectively  we recorded million and million of interest expense associated with changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent interest obligation 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of our fixed rate convertible notes 
we receive a fixed rate from the counterparty  payable on a semi annual basis  and pay to the counterparty a floating rate based on month libor minus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
the interest rate swap agreement terminates in march  subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events  including redemption or conversion of the convertible notes 
the interest rate swap agreement qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 as amended accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap agreement is recorded as a component of interest expense 
in  we recorded an additional million of interest expense associated with the interest rate swap  while we recorded a million and million reduction in interest expense in and  respectively 
the net fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was million 
we recorded the following changes in the net fair values of the interest rate swap and the hedged portion of the contingent convertible notes in thousands interest rate swap contingent convertible notes net increase decrease in liabilities the net decrease in liabilities represents the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship  and these amounts are recorded in other income expense  net 
our net other income expense declined in by million to million of expense 
in  we recorded a million unrealized gain associated with a million euro foreign currency collar contract that expired on january  we entered into this contract to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar as a result of our commitment to acquire newdeal in january for euro million 
the collar contract did not qualify as a hedge under sfas no 
accordingly  the collar contract was recorded at fair value and changes in fair value were recorded in other income expense  net 
the foreign currency collar expired in january  concurrent with our acquisition of newdeal technologies 
income taxes in  our effective income tax rate was of income before income taxes  compared to in and in our rate includes a million tax charge related to the transfer of intangible assets 
the reduction in our effective tax rate from to was primarily related to the impact of this charge on our effective rate and the favorable impact of various planning and reorganization initiatives that we recently implemented 
our effective tax rate may vary from year to year depending on  among other factors  the geographic and business mix of taxable earnings and losses 
we consider these factors and others  including our history of generating taxable earnings  in assessing our ability to realize deferred tax assets 
the net decrease in our tax asset valuation allowance was million   and million in  and  respectively 
a valuation allowance of million is recorded against the remaining million of net deferred tax assets recorded at december  this valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for certain expenses which will be deductible for tax purposes in very limited circumstances and for which we believe it is unlikely that we will recognize the associated tax benefit 
we do not anticipate additional income tax benefits through future reductions in the valuation allowance 
however  if we determine that we would be able to realize more or less than the recorded amount of net deferred tax assets  we will record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the period such a determination is made 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes and million for foreign income tax purposes to offset future taxable income 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire through and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration 
we expect to use all of our remaining unrestricted net operating loss carryforwards in at december   several of our subsidiaries had unused net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards arising from periods prior to our ownership which expire through the internal revenue code limits the timing and manner in which we may use any acquired net operating losses or tax credits 
we do not provide income taxes on undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries because such earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested 
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled million and million  at december  and  respectively 
the american jobs creation act of was signed into law in october and has several provisions that may impact our income taxes in the future  including the repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion and a deduction related to qualified production activities income 
the qualified production activities deduction is a special deduction and will have no impact on deferred taxes existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return 
pursuant to united states department of treasury regulations issued in october  we believe that we will realize a tax benefit on qualified production activities income once we have completely utilized our unrestricted net operating losses  which is expected to occur in international product revenues and operations product revenues by major geographic area are summarized below united asia other states europe pacific foreign consolidated in thousands in  product revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
revenues from customers outside the united states included million of revenues generated in foreign currencies 
in  product revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
revenues from customers outside the united states included million of revenues generated in foreign currencies 
in  product revenues from customers outside the united states totaled million  or of consolidated product revenues  of which approximately were to european customers 
revenues from customers outside the united states included million of revenues generated in foreign currencies 
because we have operations based in europe and we generate revenues and incur operating expenses in euros and british pounds  we will experience currency exchange risk with respect to those foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses 
in  and  the cost of products we manufactured in our european facilities or purchased in foreign currencies exceeded our foreign currency denominated revenues 
we expect this imbalance to continue into we currently do not hedge our exposure to operating foreign currency risk 
accordingly  a weakening of the dollar against the euro and british pound could negatively affect future gross margins and operating margins 
we will continue to assess the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our business 
if we believe this potential impact presents a significant risk to our business  we may enter into derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
additionally  we generate significant revenues outside the united states  a portion of which are us dollar denominated transactions conducted with customers who generate revenue in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which those customers do business may have an impact on the demand for our products in foreign countries 
local economic conditions  regulatory or political considerations  the effectiveness of our sales representatives and distributors  local competition and changes in local medical practice all may combine to affect our sales into markets outside the united states 
relationships with customers and effective terms of sale frequently vary by country  often with longer term receivables than are typical in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
investments consist almost entirely of highly liquid  interest bearing debt securities 
cash flows we generated positive operating cash flows of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
operating cash flows continued to improve primarily as a result of higher pre tax income  improved working capital management  and the benefits from the continued utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax deductions generated by employee stock option exercises 
in and  changes in working capital items reduced operating cash flows by million and million  respectively 
in  we experienced delays in customer collections related to business systems transitions 
the improvement in working capital in relates to an improvement in the collection cycle for accounts receivable 
in  we are targeting a decrease in days on hand in inventory to further improve operating cash flows 
we expect to use all of our remaining unrestricted net operating loss carryforwards in accordingly  we do not expect to realize the same level of benefits to our operating cash flows in as compared to prior years 
in  we used million to repurchase million shares of our common stock  which was partially offset by million in cash flows generated from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
other principal uses of funds in were million for acquisitions and million for capital expenditures 
in  we generated million of cash flows from the net sales and maturities of our investments in marketable debt securities 
in  we generated million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
we used million of cash for acquisitions  million for the net purchases of marketable debt securities  million for the repurchase of  shares of our common stock and million for capital expenditures 
in  we generated million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans and million of net proceeds from the sale of million of our contingent convertible subordinated notes 
we used million of cash for acquisitions  million for the net purchases of marketable debt securities  million for the repurchase of million shares our common stock and million for capital expenditures 
the significant repurchase of our common stock in was made simultaneously with the issuance of our convertible notes 
working capital at december  and  working capital was million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital in was primarily due to increases in short term investments as our non current investment portfolio came closer to maturity in convertible debt and related hedging activities we pay interest on our contingent convertible subordinated notes at an annual rate of each september th and march th 
we will also pay contingent interest on the notes if  at thirty days prior to maturity  our common stock price is greater than 
the contingent interest will be payable at maturity for each of the last three years the notes remain outstanding in an amount equal to the greater of of the face amount of the notes and the amount of regular cash dividends paid during each such year on the number of shares of common stock into which each note is convertible 
holders of the notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances  including when the market price of our common stock on the previous trading day is more than per share  based on an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes are general  unsecured obligations of integra and will be subordinate to any future senior indebtedness 
we cannot redeem the notes prior to their maturity  and the notes holders may compel us to repurchase the notes upon a change of control 
there are no financial covenants associated with the convertible notes 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a million notional amount to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of the notes 
see results of operations non operating income and expenses 
we receive a fixed rate from the counterparty and pay to the counterparty a floating rate based on month libor minus basis points 
our effective interest rate on the hedged portion of the notes was as of december  share repurchase plans during  and  we repurchased million  million  and million shares  respectively  of our common stock under authorized share repurchase programs 
in may  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed million through december  we were authorized to repurchase no more than million shares under this program 
in october  our board of directors terminated the may repurchase program and adopted a new program that authorized us to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed million through december  during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for million under the may and october repurchase programs 
in february  our board of directors terminated the october repurchase program and adopted a new program that authorizes us to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed million through december  shares may be purchased either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
dividend policy we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our formation 
any future determinations to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
requirements and capital resources we believe that our cash and marketable securities are sufficient to finance our operations and capital expenditures in the near term 
in march  we used approximately million in cash to complete the acquisition of the radionics division of tyco healthcare group  lp and pay related transaction expenses 
given the significant level of liquid assets and our objective to grow by acquisition and alliances  our financial position could change significantly if we were to complete another business acquisition by utilizing a significant portion of our liquid assets 
in december  we established a million  five year  senior secured revolving credit facility 
the credit facility currently allows for revolving credit borrowings in a principal amount of up to million  which can be increased to million should additional financing be required in the future 
we plan to utilize the credit facility for working capital  capital expenditures  share repurchases  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes

the above table does not include contingent interest that we may be obligated to pay on our contingent convertible subordinated notes due in march see results of operations non operating income and expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements the million of outstanding contingent convertible subordinated notes we have outstanding at december  are convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock 
if all these notes were converted  our stockholders could experience significant dilution 
we would not receive any additional cash proceeds upon the conversion of the notes 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates affecting amounts reported or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements include allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns and allowances  net realizable value of inventories  amortization periods for acquired intangible assets  and loss contingencies 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies  which form the basis for developing these estimates  are those that are most critical to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that we reasonably expect to collect 
for all other customers  we record allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  we may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future through charges or reductions to selling  general and administrative expense 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product revenues in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and allowances and other known factors 
if actual returns or allowances are different from our estimates and the related provisions for sales returns and allowances  we may change the sales returns and allowances provision in the future through an increase or decrease in product revenues 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate ending inventories for excess quantities  obsolescence or shelf life expiration 
our evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product  projections of future demand by product  the risk of technological or competitive obsolescence for our products  general market conditions  a review of the shelf life expiration dates for our products  and the feasibility of reworking or using excess or obsolete products or components in the production or assembly of other products that are not obsolete or for which we do not have excess quantities in inventory 
to the extent that we determine there are excess or obsolete quantities or quantities with a shelf life that is too near its expiration for us to reasonably expect that we can sell those products prior to their expiration  we record valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related products to adjust their carrying value to estimated net realizable value 
if future demand or market conditions are different from our projections  or if we are unable to rework excess or obsolete quantities into other products  we may change the recorded amount of inventory valuation reserves through a charge or reduction in cost of product revenues in the period the revision is made 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval  based on management s judgment of probable future commercialization 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies or a decision by management to discontinue the related development program 
at december   we capitalized approximately million of pre approval inventory 
if management decides to discontinue the related development program or we are not able to get the required approvals from regulatory bodies to market these products  we would expense the value of the capitalized pre approval inventory to research and development expense 
amortization periods we provide for amortization using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of acquired intangible assets 
we base the determination of these useful lives on the period over which we expect the related assets to contribute to our cash flows or a shorter period such that recognition of the amortization better corresponds with the distribution of expected revenues 
if our assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  we may change future amortization expense 
loss contingencies we are subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business  including claims by employees or former employees  with respect to our products and involving commercial disputes 
our financial statements do not reflect any material amounts related to possible unfavorable outcomes of claims and lawsuits to which we are currently a party because we currently believe that such claims and lawsuits are either adequately covered by insurance or otherwise indemnified  or are not expected  individually or in the aggregate  to result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible these contingencies could materially affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows in a particular period if we change our assessment of the likely outcome of these matters 
other matters recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
pro forma footnote disclosure will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we adopted statement r on january  using the modified prospective method 
we expect to record million of share based compensation expense in as a result of the adoption of fas r 
however  our estimate of future share based compensation expense is affected by our stock price  the number of share based awards that we may grant in  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax effects 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behavior 
information about the historical impact of statement on our reported financial information can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are included herein under item we expect that the most significant impact of the adoption of statement r in will be to our selling  general and administrative expenses 
information about other recently issued accounting standards is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures  we may enter into various derivative transactions when appropriate 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk because we have operations based in europe and we generate revenues and incur operating expenses in euros and british pounds  we will experience currency exchange risk with respect to those foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses 
in  the total cost of products we manufacture in or purchase in foreign currencies and other operating expenses that we incur in foreign currencies exceeded our total foreign currency denominated revenues 
we expect this imbalance to continue into a weakening of the dollar against the euro and british pound could positively affect future revenues and negatively affect future gross margins and operating margins  while strengthening of the dollar against the euro and the british pound could negatively affect future revenues and positively affect future gross margins and operating margins 
in november  we entered into a collar contract that expired on january  for million euros to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar as a result of our commitment to acquire newdeal in january for million euros 
the collar contract did not qualify as a hedge under sfas no 
accordingly  the collar contract was recorded at fair value and changes in fair value were recorded in other income expense  net 
in  we recorded a million unrealized gain related to the change in the fair value of the collar contract as of december  the foreign currency collar expired in january  concurrent with our acquisition of newdeal technologies 
other than this foreign currency collar  we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk 
as the volume of our business transacted in foreign currencies increases  we will continue to assess the potential effects that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our business 
if we believe this potential impact presents a significant risk to our business  we may enter into additional derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk 
interest rate risk marketable debt securities we are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale marketable debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applicable to our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities outstanding at december  would increase or decrease interest income by approximately million on an annual basis 
we are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these investments 
interest rate risk long term debt and related hedging instruments we are exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on the net interest received or paid under the terms of an interest rate swap 
at december   we had outstanding a million notional amount interest rate swap used to hedge the risk of changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk with respect to a portion of our million principal amount fixed rate contingent convertible subordinated notes due march we receive a fixed rate from the counterparty  payable on a semi annual basis  and pay to the counterparty a floating rate based on month libor minus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
the floating rate resets each quarter 
the interest rate swap agreement terminates on march   subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events  including redemption or conversion of our contingent convertible notes 
our effective interest rate payable on the floating rate portion of the swap was as of december  our interest rate swap agreement qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
at december   the net fair value of the interest rate swap approximated million and is included in other liabilities 
the net fair value of the interest rate swap represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreement 
a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applicable to the interest rate swap would increase or decrease interest expense by million on an annual basis
