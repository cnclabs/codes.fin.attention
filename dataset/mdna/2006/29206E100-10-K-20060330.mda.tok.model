one supplier  hulett aluminium ltd  furnished approximately of our products in we do not typically purchase inventory for stock 
instead  we place orders with our suppliers based upon orders that we have received from our customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in note b to our financial statements 
we have not adopted any significant new accounting policies during the period ended december  among the significant judgments made by management in the preparation of our financial statements are the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and accruals for inventory claims 
allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   we had  in trade receivables 
additionally  we had recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of  we report accounts receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  to represent our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash 
we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis  using historical collection trends  aging of receivables  as well as review of specific accounts  and makes adjustments in the allowance as we believe necessary 
we maintain a credit insurance policy on the majority of our customers 
in general  this policy has a co insurance  however there are some instances where the co insurance may vary and instances where we may exceed the insured values 
changes in economic conditions could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance considerations 
in addition  changes in the credit insurance environment could affect the availability of credit insurance and our ability to secure the same 
accruals for inventory claims generally  our exposure on claims for defective material is small as we refer all claims on defects back to the mill supplying the material 
in the event that we do not believe the mill will honor a claim  we will record an allowance for inventory adjustments 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  and in thousands our success during was in part due to continued customer satisfaction  supplier and customer loyalty and the ability to manage the competitive economic environment through the expansion and upgrading of our service to our suppliers and customers 
this includes the ability to ship material on a just in time basis from both private and public warehouses  and the use of proprietary on line service modules for customers to track their shipments 
this bolstered our commitment to service and customer satisfaction 
we have also used our excellent customer relationships to leverage sales per employee by developing long term relationships with our customers and understanding their needs 
in addition  due in part to our long term customers  we have been able to build sales volume without a similar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses that would otherwise accompany customer turn over 
our supply arrangements have also enabled us to benefit from the increased and steady availability of products from key suppliers 
our stable customer and supplier base has also enabled us to increase our purchases from our suppliers and to sell the majority of these quantities to our existing customer base 
while this does expose us to concentration risks  it has provided the foundation of our growth and performance 
our substantial increase in sales during was due to higher aluminum pricing  and to an increase of approximately in volumes shipped to our customers 
during  our net sales increased by  to  or above net sales in the increase in net sales was primarily due to increases in the prices of products and the steady availability of supply shipments from our existing supplier base 
our top ten customers represented of the sales in  compared to in our sales volume has been  and will continue to be  a function of our ongoing ability to secure quality aluminum products from our suppliers 
while we maintain long term supply relationships with several foreign mills  one supplier accounted for approximately of our purchases for the year ended december   and the three largest suppliers accounted for of purchases 
as a result  the termination or limitation by one or more of our largest suppliers of their relationship with us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our inventory increased by  to  during as compared to inventory of  in this increase in inventory supported our increased sales and it allowed us to be increasingly sensitive to timely shipments to our customers 
as a result of the increased inventory on hand  we were able to extend our customer service efforts by allowing additional time to stage material in our private or public warehouses to serve our customers needs 
our net income grew during this same period by 
net income for was  compared with net income for of  we did not have to increase selling  general and administrative expenses by the same percentage as our sales increased  in large part through the use of long term planning  customer relationships  and technology 
in  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  or above selling  general and administrative expenses in our strategy of maintaining long term relationships with our customers  while allowing for sales growth  also exposes us to concentration risks 
in  our interest expense increased by  to  or above interest expense in this is a result of rising interest rates and loan balances that have doubled from to to support increased sales and required inventory 
the increasing interest rates could adversely affect our profitability

in addition  due to having inventory on hand  we were able to extend our customer service efforts by allowing additional time to stage material in our private or public warehouses to achieve timely customer deliveries 
some of our customers do not accept deliveries in the last two weeks of the fiscal year which also increased the inventory levels at year end 
our net income grew during this same period by 
net income for was  compared with net income for of  we did not have to increase selling  general and administrative expenses by the same percentage as our sales increased  in large part through the use of long term planning  customer relationships  and technology

in  our interest expense increased by to  or approximately above interest expense in as a result of historically low interest rates  we have been able to minimize our interest expense and as a result our net income has increased 
in the current changing interest rate environment  our profitability could be adversely affected if the interest rates increase 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands our cash balance increased by  in the year ended december  net cash of  was used in operating activities  while  of net cash was provided by financing activities  specifically proceeds of loans from banks 
increases in accounts receivable and inventories at year end were the most significant contributor to the increased use of cash 
both of these increases support the increased volume of shipments 
we currently operate under a revolving line of credit  including a commitment to issue letters of credit  with four commercial banks 
the maximum availability of this facility is  borrowings under these lines of credit are collateralized by security interests in substantially all of our assets 
under these credit agreements  we are required to maintain working capital and net worth ratios 
these facilities expire on june  as of december   the amount outstanding under our revolving lines of credit was  including letters of credit of approximately 
management is in discussions to extend the maturity  increase the value of the overall facility  and revise some of the covenants and terms of the credit facility 
we expect to complete this transaction prior to the expiration of the current facility 
management believes that cash from operations  together with funds available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements relating to our existing operations 
we may require additional debt or equity financing in connection with the future expansion of our operations 
the table below provides a summary of our commitments and contractual obligations arrangements as of december  commitments and contingencies in thousands total less than year years years more than years bank debt operating leases letters of credit total we have contingent liabilities in the form of letters of credit to some of our suppliers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our trading activities 
it is our policy to hedge such risks  to the extent practicable 
we enter into high grade aluminum futures contracts to limit our gross margin exposure by hedging the metals content element of firmly committed purchase and sales commitments 
in cases where we enter into fixed price contracts with our suppliers and variable priced sales with our customers  we will utilize the futures market to match the terms of the purchase and sale 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our exposure related to commitments to purchase or sell non ferrous metals denominated in international currencies 
in situations where we enter into purchase or sales denominated in foreign currency  the foreign exchange market will be utilized to hedge foreign exchange risk exposure 
we record mark to market adjustments on these futures and forward positions  and on the underlying firm purchase and sales commitments which they hedge  and reflect the net gains and losses currently in earnings 
at december  and  net unrealized gain on the company s foreign exchange forward contracts amounted to approximately  and  respectively 
net realized and unrealized losses on aluminum futures contracts at december  and amounted to approximately  and  respectively 
these amounts  which represent the fair value of the derivative contracts  were offset by like amounts for the changes in the fair value of inventories and commitments which were hedged 
such amounts are reflected in the accompanying balance sheet in inventory  and derivative liabilities 
in such amounts are reflected in other current assets  inventory  and derivative liabilities
