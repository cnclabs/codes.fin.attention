as a result  the company s us life insurance subsidiaries distributed as dividends the remaining balance of their policyholders surplus accounts to the holding company during this resulted in the elimination of a future potential tax of approximately million which had not previously been provided for in current or deferred taxes because management considered the conditions under which such a tax would be paid to be remote

significant transactions and events settlement of multistate market conduct examination during  certain of the company s insurance subsidiaries entered into settlement agreements with state insurance regulators upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination led by maine  massachusetts  and tennessee relating to disability claims handling practices 
a total of states and the district of columbia are parties to the settlement agreements

the examination report did not make any findings of violations of law or market conduct regulations 
however  the examination report did identify areas of concern 
these became the focus of specific changes and enhancements to the company s disability claims handling operations which are designed to assure each claim decision is made in a consistently high quality manner 
the primary components of the settlement agreements include enhancements to the company s claims handling procedures  a reassessment process for claimants of certain previously denied or closed claims who elect to participate  additional corporate and board governance to support the oversight of the reassessment process and general claims handling practices  and payment of a fine in the amount of million that was allocated among the states and jurisdictions that joined the agreements and a potential fine of million in the future if certain standards are not met in examinations at the end of approximately two years

the insurance commissioners of maine  massachusetts  and tennessee  the states in which the company s three principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  began the multistate targeted market conduct examination in september and  as the lead state regulators  directed the course of the exam 
the company also has an insurance subsidiary domiciled in new york  but new york had been proceeding separately with its market conduct examination prior to commencement of the multistate examination 
it became a participating state and also entered into a substantially identical settlement agreement covering the subsidiary domiciled in new york 
the purpose of the examination was to determine whether the long term disability claims handling practices of the company s insurance subsidiaries reflected unfair claim settlement practices 
examiners working under the direction of the three lead state regulators reviewed policy forms  manuals  and administration and organization charts  but primarily focused on reviewing individual or group long term claim files closed  appealed  or open during two time periods from to early the claim file review led to discussions with the company that resulted in the settlement agreements 
a principal feature of the settlement agreements is a reassessment process 
under the agreements  the company is offering to reassess any individual or group long term disability claim that was denied or closed since january   except for specific categories of closures such as settlement  death  or payment of maximum benefits 
the potential pool of claims decided over the nearly five year period that are eligible for reassessment if the claimant elects to participate is approximately  claims 
however  almost half of these claims are subject to a preliminary determination as to whether the claimant seeking reassessment returned to work under the policy  in which case the claim is not eligible for further reassessment 
the company will also accept requests for reassessment from other individuals whose claims were closed after january   and through december   subject to the same closure exceptions as the group receiving notice  and from claimants who dispute the category for closure if it affects their eligibility for reassessment 
there will be ongoing oversight by the company and lead state regulators of the reassessment process 
the dol may also participate in this monitoring of the reassessment process 
see previous discussion under california settlement agreement and amendment of the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements contained herein pertaining to subsequent amendments to the multistate settlement agreements reassessment process 
the company also agreed to enhance certain aspects of its claim operations  including making changes to its organization and procedures to improve the consistency of and the support for each claim decision and create an easier process for claimants 
first  the company increased the number of experienced claims professionals involved in making claim decisions  as well as more heavily involved higher levels of management in signing off on adverse claim decisions 
doing so not only put more experienced people into closer contact with claim decisions  but it should also improve turnaround times and clarify accountability for claims decisions 
second  to improve the support for the initial claim decisions  the company modified its policies regarding medical information  including guidelines for the use of independent medical evaluations and the process for handling claimants with multiple medical conditions 
third  to make it easier for a claimant to understand and proceed through the claim process  the company added a number of service components  including referring certain claims to field personnel who will meet with the claimant in an effort to make the process less burdensome 
also  there is an additional telephone hotline available to claimants who seek additional assistance 
finally  to further assure consistency in the initial claim decision  the company added a position of quality compliance consultant to assess the totality of the claim decision and to focus on issues of compliance and documentation 
the final principal part of the settlement agreements addressed aspects of corporate governance which are intended to reflect today s greater emphasis in this area and to help establish best practices for the industry 
a regulatory compliance unit  reporting directly to a newly formed regulatory compliance committee of the board of directors  was created to monitor the reassessment process  compliance with market conduct regulations and erisa 
table of contents requirements  as well as general claims handling compliance 
the committee is composed of five independent directors  including two directors with significant insurance industry or insurance regulatory experience 
the agreements will remain in place until the later of january   or the completion of an examination of claims handling practices and an examination of the reassessment process  both of which will be conducted by the lead state regulators 
in addition to the fine of million  the insurance subsidiaries that are parties to the settlement agreements are subject as a group to potential fines for non compliance with the settlement agreements  including contingent fines of  per day if certain implementation deadlines are not met and a contingent fine of million for failure to satisfactorily meet the performance standards in the settlement agreements relating to the examinations referred to above  which will be conducted in approximately two years 
this latter contingent fine relating to examination of the claims handling practices or the reassessment process is limited to a maximum of million for both examinations should the performance standards not be met 
the performance standard is based on compliance with a maximum tolerance standard for claims procedures based on review of a statistically credible random sample of individual or group claims 
the company believes that the changes it has made to its claims operations and to enhance its oversight functions will substantially reduce the likelihood that the company would fail to meet the performance standards in the agreements when these examinations are concluded 
restructuring of individual income protection closed block business in the first quarter of  the company restructured its individual income protection closed block business wherein three of its insurance subsidiaries entered into reinsurance agreements to reinsure approximately percent of potential future losses that occur above a specified retention limit 
the individual income protection closed block reserves in these three subsidiaries comprise approximately percent of the company s overall retained risk in the closed block of individual income protection 
the reinsurance agreements effectively provide approximately percent reinsurance coverage for the company s overall consolidated risk above the retention limit  which equaled approximately billion in existing statutory reserves at the date of the transaction 
the maximum risk limit for the reinsurer was approximately million initially and grows to approximately billion over time  after which any further losses will revert to the company 
these reinsurance transactions were effective as of april  the company transferred cash equal to million of reserves ceded in the individual income protection closed block segment plus an additional million in cash for a before tax prepaid cost of insurance which was deferred and is being amortized into earnings over the expected claim payment period covered under the company s retention limit

in conjunction with the restructuring of the individual income protection closed block business  effective january   the company modified its reporting segments to include a separate segment for this business

based upon this analysis  the company lowered the claim reserve discount rate to reflect the segmentation of assets between the individual income protection recently issued business and the individual income protection closed block business  the change in the company s investment portfolio yield rates during the first quarter of  the company s expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates  and the company s desire to maintain the relationship between the claim reserve discount rate and the investment portfolio yield rate for the individual income protection closed block at the company s long term objective 
the segmentation of the investment portfolio was necessary to ensure appropriate matching of the duration of the assets and the related policy liabilities 
based on this analysis  in the first quarter of the company increased its individual income protection closed block claim reserves by million before tax  or million after tax  to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations 
the first quarter change represented a percent increase in total net individual income protection closed block segment reserves as of march   which equaled billion prior to this increase 
financing as part of the restructuring  in may  the company issued million adjustable conversion rate equity security units units in a private offering for million 
the company subsequently registered the privately placed securities for resale by the private investors

the analysis was initiated based on lower claim resolution rates observed during the first quarter of the claim resolution rate is the rate of probability that a disability claimant will recover  die  or reach maximum benefit limits and no longer receive benefit payments from the company 
generally  claim resolution rates vary by the age of the claimant at the time of disability  duration or length of time since the disability initially occurred  and claim diagnosis 
the claim resolution rates for group long term income protection during the first quarter of were below levels anticipated for reserves and were lower than those experienced in the full years   and the analysis indicated not only a decrease in overall claim resolution rates  but also a change in claim resolution rates by claim duration 
the analysis of emerging claim resolution rates and the reasons driving the changes resulted in a reduction in the company s long term expectations with respect to claim resolution rates 
the company s long term expectations applied to all claims incurred regardless of the date of incurral 
in addition  the company reviewed the reserve discount rate  which is the interest rate at which future cash flows for benefits and expenses to be paid are discounted to determine the current value of those cash flows 
the company concluded at that time that a change in its discount rate assumptions was not warranted 
based on the april analysis  in the first quarter of the company increased its us brokerage group long term income protection claim reserves by million before tax  or million after tax  to reflect its current estimate of future benefit obligations 
the active claim reserve for claims already reported to the company and still in open claim status was increased by million  the ibnr reserve was decreased by million  and the reopen reserve was decreased by million before tax 
the first quarter change represented a percent increase in total net us brokerage group income protection reserves as of march   which equaled billion prior to this increase 
in january  the company completed its annual review of claim reserves to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses 
based upon this review  as of december   the company increased its us brokerage group long term income protection claim reserves by million and its us brokerage group short term income protection claim reserves by million  for a total 
table of contents increase of million before tax and million after tax 
approximately million of the reserve strengthening reflected implementation of a lower discount rate for the company s group income protection claim reserves 
the discount rate was lowered to reflect the company s actual change in investment portfolio yield rates during  the expectation of future investment portfolio yield rates  and the company s new discount rate management approach of maintaining a wider spread between its group income protection portfolio investment yield rate and its average discount rate 
the company s new discount rate management approach is intended to better reflect the current investment environment and position the company to be more responsive with discount rates on new incurred claims as changes to the investment environment emerge 
approximately million of the reserve increase related to a strengthening of the morbidity assumptions to reflect the impact of the company s view of a continuing jobless economic recovery on claim incidence and severity 
of this amount  approximately million was established to reflect higher claim incidence expectations 
claim incidence in the second half of was percent higher than the first half of the year and percent above the second half of the company s january review indicated that claim incidence is expected to continue at an elevated level for several quarters as the company believes that early indications of a recovering economy are not yet reflected in improved consumer confidence or job creation 
also included in the million strengthening was approximately million to reflect higher severity expectations driven primarily by a lengthening of claim duration expectations in those claims that have been open months or longer 
the million reserve increase represented a percent increase in total net us brokerage group income protection reserves as of december   which totaled billion prior to this increase 
acquisitions and dispositions during the first quarter of  unum limited acquired the united kingdom group income protection business of sun life assurance company of canada uk ltd sun life together with the renewal rights to sun life s group life business  at a price of approximately million 
furthering its goal of divesting its non core operations  during  the company reinsured on a percent indemnity coinsurance basis for non new york policies and a percent indemnity coinsurance basis for new york policies certain of its insurance policies sold through trade associations and ceded approximately million of reserves to the reinsurer 
the annual premium on the block reinsured was approximately million and related primarily to individual income protection closed block policies 
the transaction had an effective date of april  financing in order to strengthen its capital position  during  the company issued million shares of common stock  par value per share  in a public offering and received approximately million in proceeds from the sale of the shares after deducting underwriting discounts 
also in  the company issued million adjustable conversion rate equity security units units in a million public offering 
proceeds from the offerings were used primarily to increase the capitalization of the company s insurance subsidiaries and to repay amounts loaned to the company from its insurance subsidiaries 
accounting pronouncements derivatives implementation group issue b effective october   the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
implementation issue b dig issue b  embedded derivatives modified coinsurance arrangements and debt instruments that incorporate credit risk exposure that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the obligor under those instruments 
dig issue b addresses financial accounting and reporting for embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance contracts that incorporate credit risk exposure unrelated to the credit risk of the counterparty to the reinsurance contract and requires the bifurcation of any such derivative from the host reinsurance contract 
the change in the fair value of the derivative is reported as a realized investment gain or loss during the period of change 

table of contents the company had two reinsurance contracts for which dig issue b was applicable 
transition to the provisions of dig issue b required the company to value the credit risk provisions in these contracts as derivatives and report them in the consolidated statements of financial condition at their current fair values  with the change in fair value since inception of the reinsurance contracts up to the date of adoption reported as a cumulative effect of accounting principle change 
the company included in miscellaneous assets a deposit asset for one of the applicable reinsurance contracts 
the deposit asset previously included unrealized gains or losses on the marketable securities held in the trust 
under the provisions of dig issue b  any net unrealized gain was attributed to the value of the embedded derivative and was reported as such in fixed maturity securities 
any net unrealized loss was attributed to the marketable securities held in the trust and reported as an adjustment to the deposit asset  with the related effects on claim reserves reflected in the reinsurance receivable for claim reserves 
the adoption of dig issue b resulted in an increase in fixed maturity securities of million to record the fair value of the embedded derivatives  a decrease of million in miscellaneous assets  million in reinsurance receivable  and million in accumulated other comprehensive income net unrealized gain on securities to eliminate the previously reported adjustment to fair value of the marketable securities held in the trust and the related effects on claim reserves  and a million cumulative effect of accounting principle change  net of million in tax

critical accounting policies reserves for policy and contract benefits the two primary categories of liabilities for policy and contract benefits are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred and have future benefits to be paid 
policy reserves equal the present value of the difference between future policy benefits and future premiums  allowing a margin for expenses and profit 
these reserves are applicable for the majority of the company s business  which is traditional non interest sensitive in nature 
the claim payments are estimated using assumptions established when the policy was issued 
throughout the life of the policy  the reserve is based on the original assumptions used for the policy s issue year 
ordinarily  generally accepted accounting principles require that these assumptions not be subsequently modified unless the policy reserves are determined to be inadequate 
a claim reserve is established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
policy reserves for a particular policy continue to be maintained after a claim reserve has been established for as long as the policy remains in force 
claim reserves generally equal the company s estimate  at the current reporting period  of the present value of the liability for future benefits and expenses to be paid on claims incurred as of that date 
a claim reserve for a specific claim is based on assumptions derived from the company s actual historical experience as to claim duration as well as the specific characteristics of the claimant such as benefits available under the policy  the covered benefit period  and the age and occupation of the claimant 
consideration is given to current and historical trends in the company s experience and to expected deviations from historical experience that result from changes in benefits available  changes in the company s risk management policies and procedures  and other economic  environmental  or societal factors 
reserves for claims that are estimated to have already been incurred but that have not yet been reported to the company are based on factors such as historical claim reporting patterns  the average cost of claims  and the expected volumes of incurred claims 

table of contents claim reserves  unlike policy reserves  are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change 
in a reporting period  actual experience may deviate from the long term assumptions used to determine the claim reserves 
the company reviews annually  or more frequently as appropriate  emerging experience to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses 
the company s reserves for group and individual income protection products include a provision for future payments  other than legal expenses  on all claim related lawsuits for which the cause of action has already occurred 
this includes known lawsuits and those yet to be filed 
the reserve amount is the company s estimate of the payments on all such lawsuits based on past payments and expected future payments 
claim reserves  in general  are an estimate of the current value of future  otherwise unfunded  benefit commitments or liabilities 
the calculation of claim reserves involves numerous assumptions 
in setting these assumptions  the company depends upon industry information and experience  company experience and analysis  and reasoned judgment 
there can be no guarantee that these assumptions individually  or collectively  will be duplicated by actual experience over time 
the primary assumptions related to claim reserves are the discount rate  the claim resolution rate  and the incidence rate for incurred but not reported ibnr claims 
the discount rate is the interest rate at which future benefit cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of those cash flows 
it is important since higher discount rates produce lower reserves 
if the discount rate is higher than future investment returns  the company s assets will not earn sufficient investment income to support future liabilities 
in this case  the reserves may eventually be insufficient 
alternatively  if a discount rate is chosen that is too low relative to future investment results  the reserve  and thus the claim cost in the current period  will be overstated and profits will be accumulated in the reserves rather than released through earnings 
the company sets its discount rate assumptions in conjunction with the current and expected future investment income rate of the assets supporting the reserves 
if the investment yield at which new investments are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio  it is likely that the discount rate on new claims will be established below or above the discount rate on existing claims 
it is the company s intent to use a discount rate that provides some margin for adverse movement in the investment portfolio yield rate 
since policies may receive claim payments for a number of years  it is unlikely that the chosen discount rate assumption will prove to be accurate for any one policy  rather  the discount rate is chosen to apply to many claims with various characteristics of length and severity 
the company uses its experience and analysis of its existing claims and investment performance to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption 
actual claim reserves incurred in the calendar quarter are sensitive to the choice of discount rate 
for example  a basis point increase or decrease in the us brokerage group long term income protection claim discount rate for current year claims would change a quarter s incurred claim cost in by approximately million 
the claim resolution rate is the rate of probability that a disability claim will close or change due to maximum benefits being paid under the policy  the recovery or death of the insured  or a change in status in any given period 
it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim 
estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time 
a claim closes due to maximum benefits being paid if all of the contractual benefits under the policy have been paid 
a claim also closes if the policyholder recovers from his or her disability and is no longer receiving disability benefit payments or if the policyholder dies in the period 
a claim may change status during the period 
for example  a policyholder receiving disability benefits may return to part time work  and the claim benefit may be reduced to reflect the change to partial disability 
establishing claim resolution assumptions is complex and involves many factors  including the cause of disability  the policyholder s age  the type of contractual benefits provided  etc 
claim resolution assumptions also vary by duration of disability and time since initially becoming disabled 
the company uses its extensive claim experience and analysis to develop its claim resolution assumptions 
claim resolution experience is studied over a number of years with more weight placed on the more recent experience 
claim resolution assumptions are established to represent the company s future resolution rate expectations 
due to the individual nature of each claim  it is unlikely that the claim resolution rate will be accurate for any particular claim 
the company establishes its claim resolution assumptions to apply as an average to its large base of active claims 
in this manner  the assumed rates are much more accurate over the broad base of claims 
actual claim reserves incurred in the calendar quarter are sensitive to the choice of resolution rate 
for example  a 
table of contents one percent increase or decrease in the us brokerage group long term income protection claim resolution rate would change a quarter s incurred claim cost in by approximately million 
the company has liability for claims that have been incurred but not reported to the company and must establish a liability for these claims equal to the present value of the expected benefit payments 
in addition to the discount rate and claim resolution rate  the incidence rate is also a primary assumption in the ibnr reserve 
the incidence rate is the rate at which new claims per thousand insured lives are submitted to the company 
the incidence rate is affected by many factors including the age of the insured  the insured s occupation or industry  the benefit plan design  and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment 
the company establishes the incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations 
as the actual claims are reported and claim reserves are established  the accuracy of the ibnr emerges 
while the company expects its ibnr reserve to be appropriate over the long term  it will not always equal  in a particular reporting period  the actual reserve established for a reported claim 
for example  a basis point deviation in the actual incidence rate from that assumed in the us brokerage ibnr reserve would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million in claim reserves established during a quarter in  relative to the ibnr reserve previously established to cover those claims 
presented as follows are reserves by each major line of business within each segment with discussion regarding material changes 
in millions of dollars december  december  ibnr all other total ibnr all other total group income protection group life and accidental death dismemberment individual income protection recently issued long term care voluntary workplace benefits us brokerage segment unum limited segment colonial segment individual income protection closed block segment other segment consolidated ibnr for income protection includes reopen reserves 
these two categories of reserves are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring that has only been on a combined basis 
equals the sum of policy and contract benefits  reserves for future policy and contract benefits  unearned premiums  and other policyholder funds as reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
certain items for the unum limited segment have been reclassified between ibnr and all other to conform to current reporting 

table of contents the increase in ibnr reserves from december  is due primarily to the individual income protection closed block segment  which includes a reclassification of reserves from all other to ibnr reflecting additional ibnr reserves associated with the recapture of the reinsurance treaty in  and the unum limited segment  which is due to growth in insured lives and the average premium size per policy 
partially offsetting these increases is a decrease in the ibnr reserves for the us brokerage segment due primarily to decreases in insured lives in the group income protection and group life and accidental death and dismemberment lines of business 
the increase in all other reserves from december  is driven by growth in the active life reserves for the u 
s 
brokerage long term care and individual income protection recently issued lines of business and growth in the disabled life reserves in the us brokerage group income protection line of business 
deferred policy acquisition costs the company defers certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortizes expenses these costs over the life of the related policies 
deferred costs include certain commissions  other agency compensation  selection and policy issue expenses  and field expenses 
acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business  such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy  are excluded from deferral 
the company uses its own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of its business in determining the expected life of the policies 
over percent of the company s deferred policy acquisition costs relate to traditional non interest sensitive products  for which the costs are amortized in proportion to the estimated premium income to be received over the life of the policies in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is higher than in the later years due to higher anticipated policy persistency in the early years  which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy 
amortization of deferred costs on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the anticipated experience 
the company will experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected 
deferred costs related to us brokerage group and individual income protection products are generally amortized over a twenty year period  with approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs related to group income protection products expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
for individual income protection policies  approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
deferred costs for us brokerage group and individual long term care products are amortized over a twenty year period  with approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
deferred costs for us brokerage group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are amortized over a fifteen year period  with approximately percent of the cost expected to be amortized by year ten 
deferred costs for us brokerage voluntary products are amortized over a fifteen year period  with approximately percent of the cost expected to be amortized by year ten 
deferred costs for unum limited group and individual income protection and group life products are generally amortized over a fifteen year period  with approximately percent of the original deferred costs expected to be amortized by year ten 
deferred costs for products issued by the colonial segment are generally amortized over a seventeen year period  on average  with approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
valuation of fixed maturity securities in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  the company evaluates the following factors the probability of recovering principal and interest 
the company s ability and intent to retain the security for a sufficient period of time for it to recover 
whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments 
the significance of the decline in value 
the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value 
current and future business prospects and trends of earnings 

table of contents the valuation of the security s underlying collateral 
relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles 
market conditions 
rating agency actions 
bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity 
adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments 
any other key measures for the related security 
the company s review procedures include  but are not limited to  monthly meetings of certain members of the company s senior management personnel to review reports on the entire portfolio  identifying investments with changes in market value of five percent or more  investments with changes in rating either by external rating agencies or internal analysts  investments segmented by issuer  industry  and foreign exposure levels  and any other relevant investment information to help identify the company s exposure to possible credit losses 
based on this review of the entire investment portfolio  individual investments may be added to or removed from the company s watch list  which is a list of securities subject to enhanced monitoring and a more intensive review 
the company also determines if its investment portfolio is overexposed to an issuer that is showing warning signs of deterioration and  if so  the company makes no further purchases of that issuer s securities and may seek opportunities to sell securities it holds from that issuer to reduce the company s exposure 
the company monitors below investment grade securities as to individual exposures and in comparison to the entire portfolio as an additional credit risk management strategy  looking specifically at the company s exposure to individual securities currently classified as below investment grade 
in determining current and future business prospects and cash availability  the company considers the parental support of an issuer in its analysis but does not rely heavily on this support 
if the company determines that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value  and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period to the extent of the decline in value 
if the decline is considered temporary  the security continues to be carefully monitored 
these controls have been established to identify the company s exposure to possible credit losses and are intended to give the company the ability to respond rapidly 
the company has no held to maturity fixed maturity securities 
all fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
fair values are based on quoted market prices  where available 
private placement fixed maturity securities had a fair value of approximately billion  or percent of total fixed maturity securities  at december  private placement fixed maturity securities do not have readily determinable market prices 
for these securities  the company uses internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs  including valuations based on estimates of future profitability  to estimate the fair value 
additionally  the company obtains prices from independent third party brokers to establish valuations for certain of these securities 
the company s ability to liquidate its positions in some of these securities could be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and the company may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
although the company believes its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  the key assumptions about the risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors involve significant assumptions and may not reflect those of an active market 
the company believes that generally these private placement securities carry a credit quality comparable to companies rated baa or bbb by major credit rating organizations 

table of contents as of december   the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of private placement fixed maturity securities included the following risk free interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities 
current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points were added to the risk free rate to reflect the lack of liquidity 
an additional five basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments 
additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for certain industries and for individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 
increasing the basis points added to the risk free rate for lack of liquidity by basis points  increasing the five basis points added to the risk free rates for foreign investments by one basis point  and increasing the additional basis points added to each industry considered to be of greater risk by one basis point would have decreased the december  net unrealized gain in the fixed maturity securities portfolio by approximately million 
historically  the company s realized gains or losses on dispositions of its private placement fixed maturity securities have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodology described above 
changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities  other than declines that are determined to be other than temporary  are reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
if it is subsequently determined that any of these securities are other than temporarily impaired  the impairment loss is reported as a realized investment loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
the recognition of the impairment loss does not affect total stockholders equity to the extent that the decline in value had been previously reflected in other comprehensive income 
there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring the company s fixed maturity securities for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities the assessment of a borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations will change 
the economic outlook  either domestic or foreign  may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated  and as such  the security may not recover in value 
new information may become available concerning the security  such as disclosure of accounting irregularities  fraud  or corporate governance issues 
significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry 
adverse rating agency actions may occur 
reinsurance receivable reinsurance is a contractual agreement whereby the company s reinsurance partners assume a defined portion of the risk for future benefits payable under reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance receivable reported as an asset in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition includes amounts due from the company s reinsurers on current claims and estimates of amounts that will be due on future claims 
policy reserves and claim reserves reported in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition are not reduced for reinsurance 
the reinsurance receivable is generally equal to the policy reserves and claim reserves related to the risk being reinsured 
the company reduces the reinsurance receivable if recovery is not likely due to the financial position of the reinsurer or if there is disagreement between the company and the reinsurer regarding the liability of the reinsurer 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is not amortized  but the company reviews on an annual basis the carrying amount of goodwill for indications of impairment  with consideration given to financial performance and other relevant factors 
in accordance with accounting guidance  the company tests for impairment at either the operating segment level or one level below 
in addition  certain events including  but not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal 
table of contents factors or the business environment  an adverse action by a regulator or rating agency  or unanticipated competition would cause the company to review goodwill for impairment more frequently than annually 
the goodwill reported as an asset in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition at december  is attributable primarily to the acquisition of the paul revere life insurance company individual income protection recently issued business and genex services  inc disability management services business 
the impairment testing for goodwill involves estimating the fair value of the individual income protection block of recently issued business and the fair value of the disability management services business based upon the present value of future cash flows using assumptions such as future sales  morbidity experience  portfolio yield rate  and the rate of return at which the company believes the market would price the businesses for purchase 
adverse changes in any of these factors could result in an impairment of goodwill for either or both of the blocks of business 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company s valuation allowance relates primarily to assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards and assets for the company s basis in certain of its foreign subsidiaries that are not likely to be realized in the future based on management s expectations using currently available evidence 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  the company has considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event the company determines that it most likely would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability 
the company records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on management s estimate of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes will probably be due 
however  due to the complexity of the tax laws and uncertainties in their interpretation  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the probable tax liabilities 
if the estimate of the tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer probable 
management believes that adequate accruals have been provided for all years presented

these non gaap financial measures of operating revenue and operating income or operating loss differ from revenue and income loss from continuing operations before income tax as presented in the company s consolidated operating results reported herein and in income statements prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of before tax realized investment gains and losses 
the company measures segment performance for purposes of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  excluding realized investment gains and losses because management believes that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and the underlying trends in the businesses 
the company s investment focus is on investment income to support its insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains and losses  and a long term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business 
realized investment gains and losses are dependent on market conditions and not necessarily related to decisions regarding the underlying business of the company s segments 
however  income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of the company s overall profitability

the company anticipated relatively weaker sales for the first half of relative to the comparable period of for both group and individual income protection products primarily as a result of the competitive pricing environment 
the company began to restore sales momentum during the latter half of the year  particularly in the small and mid employer core markets  while maintaining its commitment to a disciplined pricing approach for new business 
the company intends to continue to emphasize profitable premium growth through a balance of new sales  renewal programs  and persistency of existing profitable blocks of business 

table of contents sales highlights for showing progress in achievement of the strategy of disciplined pricing and a balanced business mix through diversification include sales in for fully insured group long term and short term income protection and group life in the small and mid employer core markets increased approximately percent in these three product lines  offset by a decline in sales in the more competitive large case market 
individual income protection recently issued sales attributable to multi life business were approximately percent of this product line s new sales in compared to percent in voluntary workplace benefits sales increased in comparison to the prior year due to both growth in existing products along with the introduction of new products 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  group long term and short term income protection sales  on a fully insured basis  decreased during compared to due to a decline in sales as a result of the company s aforementioned approach to pricing and continued shift to focus on the small and mid employer core markets 
sales for group life decreased in relative to due to a more competitive market  which resulted in sales declines in all market sizes  and also due to a decrease in large employer market sales 
the company anticipated weaker sales for as compared to for its group products due primarily to its balanced business mix strategy and the competitive pricing environment 
the portion of the individual income protection sales attributable to multi life business was approximately percent for sales and percent for sales  although both multi life and non multi life sales declined in relative to the prior year 
voluntary workplace benefits sales increased in relative to and were generally in line with the company s expectations 
segment persistency and renewal of existing business year ended december  compared with year ended december  the company monitors persistency of its existing business and reflects adverse changes in persistency in the current period s amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
one way in which the company monitors persistency is at the overall block of business level ie  group long term income protection  group short term income protection  and group life 
persistency  at the overall block of business level  is the year to date rate at which existing business for all issue years in the block of business at the beginning of the period remains inforce at the end of the period 
in determining whether additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is required due to adverse persistency  the company measures persistency by issue year ie  the rate at which existing business for that specific issue year at the beginning of the period remains inforce at the end of the period 
the rate of persistency for an overall block of business may improve while individual issue years within the overall block of business may deteriorate and require additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
persistency during for the overall block of fully insured group long term income protection  on average  was level with  but was higher than expected 
persistency for fully insured group short term income protection  on average  declined marginally during compared to the prior year and was slightly less than expected 
included in the policy terminations was a group policyholder who did not terminate the relationship with the company  but transferred from fully insured short term income protection to aso 
adjusting persistency for this policyholder s transfer  persistency for fully insured group short term income protection was slightly higher than expected for it was anticipated that persistency in the group income protection business would decline in due to the company s more disciplined approach to pricing  renewals  and risk selection 
since the group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are primarily sold in conjunction with group income protection  the more focused renewal effort in group income protection has reduced persistency in these lines  though the reduction in persistency is less than anticipated 
the persistency for the supplemental and voluntary product lines generally continues to be within expected levels 

table of contents for the years and subsequent  the company lowered its premium persistency assumptions for group income protection  group life  and group accidental death and dismemberment policy acquisition costs deferred in those years to reflect its current estimate of persistency 
this accelerated the amortization of acquisition costs deferred in those years into the early life of the policy by using lower premium persistency assumptions to determine the scheduled or expected amortization 
although persistency in the future may be lower than historical levels  particularly in certain issue years due to the company s increased emphasis on retaining profitable business  the acceleration of scheduled amortization may eliminate the need for additional amortization related to the decline in actual persistency relative to scheduled or expected persistency 
the company does not anticipate that the persistency levels for will result in increased amortization 
during  the company completed its annual comprehensive scenario testing with respect to the amortization and recoverability of its group income protection and group life deferred policy acquisition costs 
the deferred policy acquisition costs were fully recoverable 
the assessment is performed primarily to test both recoverability and the limits of recoverability 
sustained adverse persistency at the levels tested would result in lower emerging future profits due to lower overall premium levels and additional acceleration  on a prospective basis  of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs relative to the scheduled or expected amortization  but the company does not anticipate prolonged persistency rates at the stress levels tested 
a continuing part of the company s strategy for us brokerage group business involves executing its renewal programs and managing persistency in its existing blocks of business 
persistency for the primary lines of business within the us brokerage segment is expected to remain stable or slightly improve during  which reflects the need for less aggressive renewal actions needed on the in force business and a smaller renewal program than those of and included in the company s renewal program is a focus on group income protection products sold in the state of california 
as a result of the company s settlement agreement with the california doi and the resulting revisions in group income protection product requirements for policies issued in california  the company s renewal program includes a focus on new sales and renewal of existing business in the california market 
the company s previous renewal programs have generally been successful in retaining business that is relatively more profitable than business that terminated 
while it is expected that the additional premium and related profits associated with renewal activity will continue to emerge  the company intends to balance the renewal program with the need to maximize persistency and retain producer relationships 
in january of  the company began a process of filing a request with various state insurance departments for rate adjustments on one older series of individual long term care policies 
the rate adjustment will bring the rates for this policy series closer to today s market  better reflecting current interest rates  higher expected future claims  persistency  experience  and other factors related to pricing individual long term care coverage 
overall  the average increase will be in the percent range and will affect approximately  policyholders  less than percent of the company s total long term care block of business 
increases are subject to state review and approval and will be effective on the policy anniversary following the state approval and only after the proper state specific notification requirements have been satisfied 
in states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved  customers will also be given options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  persistency during for group long term income protection  on average  declined from that experienced in terminations were more heavily concentrated in the large employer market  while persistency in the small and mid employer markets improved slightly in compared to persistency for fully insured short term income protection also declined during  on average  over the prior year 
these declines in persistency were expected due to the company s disciplined approach to pricing  renewals  and risk selection 
persistency in in group life and the supplemental and voluntary lines of business within this segment was consistent with the levels of

investments overview investment activities are an integral part of the company s business  and profitability is significantly affected by investment results 
invested assets are segmented into portfolios that support the various product lines 
generally  the investment strategy for the portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of the company s business 
the company seeks to maximize investment income and total return and to assume credit risk in a prudent and selective manner  subject to constraints of quality  liquidity  diversification  and regulatory considerations 
the company s overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with that assumed in the pricing of its insurance products 
assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities  and the portfolio is matched with liabilities so as to eliminate as much as possible the company s exposure to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the amount and timing of cash flows 
the company actively manages its asset and liability cash flow match as well as its asset and liability duration match in order to minimize interest rate risk 
the company may redistribute its investments within its different lines of business  when necessary  to adjust the cash flow and or duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios 
asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy 
cash flows from the inforce asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios 
these results enable the company to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables the company to choose the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to minimize the risk of disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is a precursor to the company s activities in derivative financial instruments  which are used to hedge interest rate risk and to manage duration match 
at december   the weighted average duration of the company s policyholder liability portfolio was approximately years  and the weighted average duration of the company s investment portfolio supporting those policyholder liabilities was approximately years 

table of contents below is a summary of the company s formal investment policy  including the overall quality and diversification objectives 
the majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of the company s portfolios 
the long term nature of the company s insurance liabilities also allows it to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns 
a maximum of percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below investment grade securities  percent in equity type instruments  up to percent in private placements  and percent in commercial mortgage loans 
the remaining assets can be held in publicly traded investment grade corporate securities  mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities  and us government agencies and municipal securities 
the company intends to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities to within a range of three years 
the weighted average credit quality rating of the portfolio should be bbb or higher 
the maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits established by the company s board of directors and is more restrictive than the percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments the company s insurance subsidiaries are allowed to own 
these internal limits are as follows rating internal limit in millions aaa a bbb bbb bb bbb bb b bb b the portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines 
derivative instruments may be used to hedge interest rate risk and foreign currency risk and match liability duration and cash flows consistent with the plan approved by the board of directors 
asset mix guidelines and limits are established by the company and approved by the board of directors 
the allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification by the investment subcommittee of the board of directors on a weekly basis 
these actions are also reviewed and approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
these investment policies and guidelines are reviewed and appropriately adjusted by the board of directors annually  or more frequently if deemed necessary 
investment results net investment income was  million in  up percent relative to the prior year 
included in net investment income for is approximately million related to the billion of bonds transferred to the company in conjunction with the recapture of a ceded closed block of individual income protection business 
excluding that  net investment income was fairly consistent with the prior year  with the increase from the growth in invested assets and higher bond call premiums offset by a lower portfolio yield due to the low interest rate environment and the investment of new cash at lower rates as well as a decline in the level of prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
the overall yield in the portfolio was percent as of december   and the weighted average credit rating was a this compares to an overall yield in the portfolio of percent as of december  and a weighted average credit rating of a in the current low interest rate market  the company expects that the portfolio yield will continue to gradually decline until the market rates on new purchases increase above the level of the overall yield

gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity bonds million or greater as of december  in millions of dollars fixed maturity bonds fair value gross unrealized loss length of time in a loss position investment grade principal protected equity linked note years below investment grade us based automobile manufacturer days year unrealized losses on investment grade fixed maturity securities principally relate to changes in interest rates or changes in market or sector credit spreads which occurred subsequent to the acquisition of the securities 
these changes are generally temporary and are not recognized as realized investment losses unless the securities are sold  it becomes unlikely that the company will hold the securities until recovery based on relevant facts and circumstances  or the securities become other than temporarily impaired 
generally  below investment grade fixed maturity securities are more likely to develop credit concerns 
as previously discussed under critical accounting policies contained herein  in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  the company utilizes a formal  well defined  and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate its fixed income investment portfolio 
the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of realized losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other than temporary impairment 
for those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss and on which the company has not recorded an impairment loss  the company believes that the decline in fair value below amortized cost is temporary 
the company has the ability to hold its securities to the earlier of recovery or maturity and intends to hold all of its fixed maturity investments until maturity to meet its liability obligations 
if information becomes available that changes the company s assessment as to whether the company will receive contractual payments related to a fixed maturity security and the security is also not projected to recover in value  the related security is generally sold 
the company may also in certain circumstances sell a security in an unrealized loss position because of changes in tax laws  when a merger or the disposition of a segment or product line results in position levels outside of the company s investment guidelines  due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements  due to unexpected changes in liquidity needs  to better match portfolio cash flows  or to take advantage of tender offers that recover up to or beyond the cost of the investment 
for those securities with a gross unrealized loss of million or greater  further discussed as follows are a the factors which the company believes resulted in the impairment and b the information the company considered  both positive and negative  in reaching the conclusion that the impairments were not other than temporary

other information pension and postretirement benefit plans the company sponsors several defined benefit pension and postretirement plans for its employees  including non qualified pension plans 
the us pension plans comprise the majority of the total benefit obligation and pension expense for the company 
the value of the benefit obligations is determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent the company s best estimate of future expected experience 
these assumptions are reviewed annually 
two of the economic assumptions  the discount rate and the long term rate of return  are adjusted accordingly based on key external indices 
the company follows statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for pensions  no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits in its financial reporting and accounting for its pension and post retirement benefit plans 

table of contents us pension and post retirement benefit plans the assumptions chosen for us pension plans and the us postretirement plan use consistent methodology but reflect the differences in the plan obligations 
the company uses a december measurement date for each plan 
the discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value 
the company sets the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of its retirement related benefit plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits 
the discount rate used for the net periodic benefit costs for the us pension plans was percent and percent in and  respectively 
using a similar methodology applied to the postretirement plan cash flows  the discount rate used in the net periodic benefit cost for and was percent and percent  respectively 
lowering the discount rate by basis points would have increased the pension expense for the us pension plans by million and would be expected to result in a million increase in the pension expense 
the long term rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid 
the company uses a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on pension plan assets 
the long term rate of return on assets used in the net periodic pension costs for the us qualified defined benefit pension plan for and was percent and percent  respectively 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets by basis points would have increased the pension expense by approximately million 
for  lowering the assumption by basis points would be expected to increase pension expense by approximately million 
the market related value equals the fair value of assets  determined as of the measurement date 
the assets are not smoothed for purposes of sfas the expected return on assets  therefore  fully recognizes all asset gains and losses through the measurement date 
the company holds an unrecognized net loss representing the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses that have not been recognized in pension expense 
as of december   there was an estimated unrecognized loss of approximately million in the us pension plans  compared to million at december  the unrecognized loss has increased due to the decline in the year end discount rate from percent at to percent at and because the rate of return on assets was percent in compared to an assumed rate of return of percent 
the unrecognized net loss is amortized as a component of pension expense 
only amounts outside of a corridor equal to percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or market related value of assets are amortized 
the pension expense is expected to include a loss amortization of approximately million 
this loss amortization was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the company reported us pension expense of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the fair value of plan assets in the us qualified defined benefit pension plan was million at december   compared to million at year end in recent years  the moderate increase in assets  coupled with the liability increase due to declining discount rates  has reduced the year end funding level in the plan such that it has a deficit of million as of december   compared to million as of december  the company had no regulatory contribution requirements for and  however  the company elected to make voluntary contributions of million and million  respectively  to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan 
the company expects to make a voluntary contribution of approximately million to its us qualified defined benefit pension plan in  based on current tax law 
non us pension plans the company s uk operation maintains a separate defined benefit plan for its eligible employees 
the uk defined benefit pension plan scheme was closed to new entrants on december  
table of contents the long term rate of return on asset assumption used in the net periodic pension costs for and was percent and percent  respectively 
the company elected to set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for the scheme to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits 
the discount rate assumptions were percent and percent as of december  and  respectively 
pension expense was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the fair value of plan assets in the scheme was million at december   compared to million at year end the scheme has a deficit of million at december   compared to million at december  the company contributes to the scheme in accordance with a schedule of contributions which requires the company to contribute to the scheme at the rate of at least percent of eligible salaries  sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation 
the company contribution rate of percent of eligible salaries is currently being reviewed 
the company made a million contribution into the scheme in january to reduce the deficit 
the company anticipates it will make additional contributions during into the scheme of approximately million 
the company previously maintained separate defined benefit plans for the employees of its canadian branch operation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to various market risk exposures including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating the company s overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
the company employs various derivative programs to manage these material market risks 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk the operations of the company are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  primarily long term us interest rates 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
management continually models and tests asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows management to choose the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to the company s activities in derivative financial instruments 
the company uses interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  exchange traded interest rate futures contracts  and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels  the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments was estimated to be billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair values of mortgage loans  which are reported in the consolidated statements of financial condition at amortized cost  would decrease by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  assuming a basis point decrease in long term interest rates from year end levels  the fair values of the company s long term debt  including junior subordinated debt  would increase approximately million and million  respectively 
the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds  private placement securities  and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of basis points in interest rates 
the effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgage backed securities is estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgage backed securities 
these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in the fair values of long term debt  including junior subordinated debt  were determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because the company actively manages its investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 
foreign currency risk the company is also subject to foreign exchange risk arising from its foreign operations and certain investment securities denominated in those local currencies 
foreign operations represented percent and percent of total assets at december  and  respectively  and percent and percent of total revenue for and  respectively 
assuming foreign exchange rates decreased percent from the december  and levels  stockholders equity and net income loss as of and for the periods then ended would not have been materially affected
