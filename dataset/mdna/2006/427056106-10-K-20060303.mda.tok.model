key markets for the company s products as a percentage by end market net sales in the years ended december  and were pulp and paper regulated including food  pharmaceutical and personal care industrial specialties including oilfield  textiles and general industrial paints and adhesives construction materials consolidated more than of the company s revenues are generated outside of north america 
net sales by region expressed as a percentage of total net sales for the years ended december  and were north america europe asia pacific latin america consolidated business segments the company currently operates through two reportable segments and four divisions performance products pulp and paper and aqualon and engineered materials and additives fibervisions and pinova 
net sales for the years ended december  and as a percent of total net sales  by division  were pulp and paper aqualon fibervisions pinova consolidated key developments during  profit from operations and net income declined from prior year levels primarily as a result of the rapid escalation in raw material  utility and transportation costs driven by the escalation in oil and gas inputs  special charges primarily associated with ongoing efforts to restructure the company s global operations including manufacturing rationalization  marketing and management realignment  research and development consolidation and corporate support realignment  and an impairment of goodwill attributable to the company s commitment to dispose of a majority interest in the fibervisions division 
despite the challenges to the current operating environment and the costs of the substantial restructuring efforts  hercules increased its cash from operations from prior year levels and continued to make progress towards its goal to further de lever its balance sheet 
in addition  the company recently announced intentions to realign the business toward a greater market focus  resulting in the formation of two new business segments that will replace the company s existing segments 
the two segments will be the aqualon group and the paper technologies and ventures group 
the aqualon group will focus on coatings and construction  the regulated industries of food  pharmaceutical and personal care  and energy and specialties solutions 
the existing pinova division will be primarily integrated into coatings and construction and regulated industries 
the paper technologies and ventures group will focus on the paper industry and manage a number of ventures that will initially include businesses focused on water management  pulp and biorefining  lubricants and adhesives 
the company anticipates that these changes will be effective for the reporting period ending march  raw materials and energy the challenging raw material environment that was experienced in continued into and escalated beginning with the first quarter primarily as a result of increasing prices for petroleum based products and the growing global demand for raw materials driven in part by substantial growth in china 
these factors continued to drive costs higher through the spring and summer months and also had a negative impact on ancillary costs such as freight and transportation 
hurricanes katrina and rita and other regional storms further exacerbated the problem by disrupting the united states gulf coast natural gas and oil exploration  development  refining and distribution infrastructure 
as a result  a number of the company s key raw material suppliers declared force majeure resulting in product allocation issues 
infrastructure damage  including that to gulf coast rail bridges  continues to impact supply distribution 
in many cases  the company has incurred fuel and energy surcharges for freight and transportation 
where necessary to maintain commitments to our customers  the company has  in some cases  incurred incremental costs to secure raw materials from alternative suppliers  some of which involved significant air freight charges 
pricing for many key raw materials reached all time highs during the year and particularly during the fourth quarter  resulting in increased raw material costs to hercules of approximately million during as compared to the escalation in energy prices also had an adverse impact on utility costs

in addition to these special charges  an update of the independent study of the company s estimated reasonably possible exposure for asbestos related liabilities was completed in the fourth quarter of despite a significant reduction in both the number of new claims received and the amounts paid to resolve claims  the study required an upward revision of the range of the company s estimated reasonably possible exposure for these matters 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge of million to reestablish and increase its reserves to million 
strategic highlights during the latter half of  certain actions were initiated that are intended to enhance and support the company s strategic direction in light of the business realignment referenced above 
at the end of september  the company announced the signing of a joint venture agreement between aqualon and the leading producers of mc in china

during december  hercules satisfied a portion of its initial capital contribution by securing the financing for certain equipment related to the new facility 
under the joint venture agreement  aqualon will have global marketing rights for the output of the joint venture and will receive sales commissions as well as royalties for licensed technology 
in january of  the company announced an agreement to purchase the guar and guar derivative manufacturing division of benchmark polymer products  lp  a subsidiary of benchmark performance group  inc benchmark 
under the terms of the agreement  aqualon acquired benchmark s dalton  georgia production facility for million plus a provisional earn out and also purchased an equity position in benchmark 
in addition  the company signed a five year exclusive agreement to supply benchmark with guar products for polymer slurries used in oil and gas fracturing applications 
this acquisition is intended to expand aqualon s presence in the energy industry 
as a result of the acquisition  aqualon is expected to increase capacity utilization of its existing guar and guar derivatives manufacturing facility in kenedy  texas 
on january   the company signed an agreement to sell a interest in its fibervisions division to an affiliate of spg partners  llc spg  a new york based private equity firm

those costs are approximately million and include approximately million of non cash pension and post retirement costs 
through a combination of decentralization  selective outsourcing and non manufacturing site consolidations  the company is targeting a total of million in cost reductions to be achieved by the end of critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires hercules to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
hercules evaluates its estimates on a regular basis  including those related to bad debts  inventories  impairments of goodwill and long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies  including litigation and environmental  and pension and other benefit obligations 
hercules bases its estimates on various factors including historical experience  consultation and advice from third party subject matter experts and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management reviews significant estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors on a regular basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
hercules believes that the following accounting estimates are critical due to the significant subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for the matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the effect of the estimates and assumptions on its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts 
the recorded amount reflects various factors  including accounts receivable aging  customer specific risk issues  country risk and historical write off experience 
it includes  but is not limited to  a formula driven calculation applied to the aging of trade accounts receivable balances 
when a specific accounts receivable balance is deemed uncollectible  a charge is taken to this reserve 
recoveries of balances previously written off are also reflected in this reserve 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company performs an annual assessment of its goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
in addition  the company consistently considers factors including deterioration in future economic conditions  poor operating results in the reporting units  new or stronger competitors  or changes in technology that could indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets  thereby requiring an impairment in the future 
to assess impairment  the company compares its reporting unit s book value of net assets  including goodwill  to its fair value 
fair value is estimated using a combination of valuation approaches including the market value and income approaches 
in the event that the book value exceeds the fair value  the company recognizes an impairment to the extent the book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit  calculated by determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities for the reporting unit 
other long lived assets the company tests other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment for impairment based on an assessment of factors including deterioration in future economic conditions  poor operating results in a business  the determination that the long lived asset is unsuitable for one reason or another  new or stronger competitors  or changes in technology  that could indicate an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset  thereby requiring an impairment in the future 
if the company determines that an impairment loss has occurred  the loss is recognized in the income statement 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized after consideration of future taxable income and reasonable tax planning strategies 
in the event that hercules were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance had not been established  or is able to utilize capital and or operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance has been established  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will be reflected in income in the period such determination is made 
restructuring  severance and other exit costs the company has and will continue to record charges for the estimated costs of employee severance and other exit costs pursuant to the company s strategy to continuously improve return on capital  streamline organizational structure  improve work processes and consolidate manufacturing and non manufacturing facilities 
in the event that it is determined that additional employees must be involuntarily terminated  or that additional manufacturing or non manufacturing facilities must be closed pursuant to work process redesign or other cost reduction initiatives  supplemental reserves would be required  which would result in an incremental charge against earnings 
environmental matters and asset retirement obligations hercules establishes reserves for environmental matters and asset retirement obligations when a legal obligation exists and the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  the company recognizes a liability for environmental related litigation and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
at december   the company had a combined amount of million accrued including million for asset retirement obligations and million for environmental related contingencies 
the actual costs will depend upon numerous factors  including the estimated useful life of the company s manufacturing facilities and significant component assets  changes in the nature or use of existing assets and facilities  the number of parties found responsible at each environmental site and their ability to pay  the actual methods of remediation required or agreed to  outcomes of negotiations with regulatory authorities  outcomes of litigation  changes in the timing of required remedial activities  changes in environmental laws and regulations  technological developments  the years of remedial activity required and changes in the number or financial exposures of claims  lawsuits  settlements or judgments  or in the ability to reduce such financial exposures by collecting indemnity payments from insurers 
if the obligations or contingencies are resolved for amounts greater or less than has been accrued  hercules share of the obligation or contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  hercules would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period such determination was made 
asbestos related contingencies hercules has established reserves for asbestos related personal injury lawsuits and claims based upon the results of a periodic actuarial study of its asbestos related liabilities by a recognized expert at a major national university 
this study is based on a number of assumptions including the number of future claims  the timing and amount of future payments  disease  venue  and the dynamic nature of asbestos litigation and other circumstances 
at december   the company had a gross accrued liability of million for present and future potential asbestos claims 
the company also had million of asbestos related receivables and restricted cash in several trusts pertaining to the aforementioned lawsuits and claims at december  pension and other postretirement benefits in the united states  the company provides defined benefit pension plan coverage for eligible employees hired prior to january  and postretirement welfare benefit plan coverage to eligible employees hired prior to january  similar plans are provided outside the united states in accordance with local practice 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related expense income are determined based upon actuarial assumptions regarding mortality  medical inflation rates  discount rates  long term return on assets  salary increases  medicare availability and other factors 
changes in these assumptions can result in changes to the recognized pension expense and recorded liability 
at december   the abo of the company s us and certain foreign defined benefit pension plans  on a consolidated basis  exceeded their funded basis 
the company is required to recognize an additional liability equal to the sum of such excess plus the prepaid pension asset balance  with a corresponding after tax charge to other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
for the year ended december  the company increased its additional minimum liability aml to million 
the increase to the aml was primarily a result of changes to the mortality table and discount rate and was partially offset by plan amendments effective january  which changed the basis by which us and certain foreign plans provide benefits from the final pay to the career average pay 
at the present time  the us defined benefit pension plan is at a sufficient funding level as to not require erisa mandated contributions 
the company has determined  however  that it is in the best interests of the company and its pension plan participants to make voluntary contributions to the plan 
if the us qualified pension plan performs in accordance with actuarial assumptions  the company presently anticipates making voluntary cash contributions averaging million per year over the next several years 
results of operations consolidated review net sales for the years ended december   and were as follows change change net sales net sales for increased from primarily as a result of million  or  in higher pricing and million  or  from higher rates of exchange offset by a million  or  decrease in volume 
there was also a slight decrease of million attributable to a broad change in product mix 
the core divisions of pulp and paper and aqualon experienced volume increases of and  respectively 
the overall decline in volume was primarily attributable to fibervisions as a result of the continuing trend of product substitution in favor of spunbond technology for diaper coverstock 
this decline in volume has not been fully offset by continued growth in the demand for applications for disposable wipes and geotextiles 
additional volume declines related to efforts to shed unprofitable accounts for both fibervisions and pinova 
net sales for increased from attributable to million  or  higher volume and million  or  higher rates of exchange offset by a million  or  unfavorable change in product mix 
a relatively small decrease of million was attributable to pricing 
net sales volume was up for all divisions except fibervisions where demand for staple fibers for diaper coverstock is in decline due to the continued rise in customer preference for fibers produced with spunbond technology 
increased production of paper and paperboard products in europe and north america drove demand in pulp and paper as well as tissue and towel and process chemicals improvements 
aqualon benefited from strong demand for pharmaceutical and personal care applications as well as paint  oilfield and applications 
however  despite higher volume  reflected an increase in lower priced products primarily related to the cmc acquisition in jiangmen 
the tables below reflect net sales per region and the percentage change from the respective prior year periods as well as the percentage change excluding the impact of rates of exchange roe change excluding regions change roe north america europe asia pacific latin america all regions change excluding regions change roe north america europe asia pacific latin america all regions during  net sales increased in north america by as compared to european markets were soft due to weakened demand  aggressive competition and industry overcapacity in certain product lines  all of which have limited the ability to raise prices to recapture a portion of incrementally higher costs 
despite slower growth in the established economies  emerging markets remained strong 
on an annual basis  asia pacific including china was up  eastern europe was up and brazil  for the pulp and paper division in particular  was up 
within asia pacific  china continues to be a bright spot with sales up across all divisions 
during  net sales increased in all regions of the world  and particularly in europe where the euro steadily increased throughout the year approximately on average against the us dollar over levels 
excluding the beneficial impact of roes  overall growth was relatively modest and reflected a shift in mix to lower priced products 
however  growth in the asia pacific region and china  which benefited from aqualon s acquisition of the cmc business in jiangmen  had an overall beneficial impact 
in addition  continued penetration of emerging markets in eastern europe and brazil provided steady growth 
change change cost of sales cost of sales increased million  or  during as compared to as a percent of sales  cost of sales increased to in as compared to in  primarily reflecting the acceleration of raw material  freight and energy costs at rates more rapidly than that which has or could be recovered through price increases and related surcharges 
these costs included record highs for certain raw materials  including polypropylene 
on an aggregated basis  raw material costs increased approximately million over levels 
a significant portion of this increase is attributable to the hurricanes in the united states gulf coast region which severely impacted petroleum and related by product refining capabilities and damaged the distribution infrastructure  further constraining supply 
accordingly  a number of key suppliers declared force majeure and placed the company on an allocation basis for certain key raw materials and feedstock derivatives 
in order to maintain production and commitments to the company s customers  alternative supply sources were utilized resulting in significantly higher cost and transportation charges 
in addition to increased raw material prices  energy costs were also adversely impacted by the storms as well as a general increase in global demand 
despite these significant challenges  the company was able to lower overall manufacturing costs primarily due to restructuring efforts in the current and prior years 
cost of sales increased million  or  during as compared to as a percent of sales  cost of sales increased to as compared to in  primarily as a result of decreasing sales prices in certain product lines and increasing raw material costs in most divisions  particularly fibervisions which was impacted by the rising costs for polypropylene 
in addition  increased energy and natural gas crude oil feedstock costs impacted many raw materials  particularly those derived from chlor alkali  ethylene  benzene and propylene 
strong demand from china for many basic materials and the strengthening global economy also exerted upward pressure on the price of raw materials 
change change selling  general and administrative expenses despite inflation  increased rates of exchange and rising employee benefits costs  restructuring and cost rationalization efforts in the current and prior years have allowed the company to maintain selling  general and administrative sg a costs at levels comparable with in addition to lower personnel related costs  including travel and entertainment  sg a costs in reflect lower professional and consulting fees due to a normalization of compliance efforts for sarbanes oxley  and lower bad debt expense and insurance costs 
these decreases were somewhat offset by higher information technology costs and higher legal defense costs primarily attributable to the ongoing patent infringement litigation with ciba specialty chemicals corporation ciba see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a percent of sales  sg a costs were reduced to in as compared to during sg a expenses increased million or during as compared to while remaining relatively flat as a percent of sales at 
of the total increase  million is attributable to higher rates of exchange during other increases include higher salaries and incentive compensation as well as significantly higher costs for consulting and other outside services  part of which were attributable to first year compliance efforts associated with sarbanes oxley 
bad debt expense was also higher during these increases were partially offset by lower postretirement benefits costs due to changes in the retiree medical plans  lower general legal fees  lower workers compensation insurance and lower rental expense due to an increase in sub lease income 
change change research and development research and development charges decreased million or primarily as a result of the ongoing consolidation efforts which reflect the closure of the company s research facility in barneveld  the netherlands during as well as the impact of ongoing cost containment efforts particularly with respect to corporate research 
research and development expenses remained relatively stable at as a percentage of sales for both and research and development charges increased million or during as compared to the increase reflects higher spending with respect to various product and applications development programs across most of the divisions continuing a trend of bringing new products to market 
as a percentage of sales  research and development was approximately for both and change change intangible asset amortization the company s portfolio of intangible assets  including customer relationships  trademarks and tradenames has remained unchanged from through resulting in a consistent charge for amortization expense 
primarily as a result of the proposed fibervisions transaction  amortization is expected to decrease to million for  million for  million for  million for and million for as various amortization terms expire 
change change impairment of fibervisions goodwill in connection with the announced plans to sell a majority interest in the fibervisions division  the company was required to test the underlying goodwill asset recorded in that division for recoverability 
the test indicated that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded its fair value

this primarily resulted from the company s repurchase of million book value of the notes during the impact of debt repurchases more than offset the unfavorable effect of increasing variable rates on the company s term b loan 
the term b loan carries a libor based interest rate and allows the company to reset into libor rates for one  two  three or six month periods 
the three month libor rate has increased by approximately basis points since january and approximately basis points since the beginning of and is continuing an upward trend 
in addition  bank fees were lower during and the company had lower amortization of deferred debt issuance costs primarily as a result of continuing debt repurchases

recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
on april   the securities and exchange commission issued an amendment to rule of regulation s x that allows companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period that begins after june  as originally required 
accordingly  the company will adopt sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on a the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
in addition  the company expects to continue to utilize the black scholes option pricing model  which is an acceptable option valuation model in accordance with sfas r  to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees 
beyond those restricted stock and stock option awards previously granted  the company cannot predict with certainty the impact of sfas r on its future consolidated financial statements as the type and amount of such awards are determined on an annual basis and encompass a potentially wide range depending upon the compensation decisions made by the human resources committee of the company s board of directors 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of compensation cost recognized in the financial statements to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than an operating cash flow as currently required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows sfas 
this requirement  to the extent it exists  will decrease net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods subsequent to adoption 
the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which expresses the view of the sec staff regarding the interaction of sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements 
the company believes that the views provided in sab are consistent with the approach taken in the valuation and accounting associated with share based compensation issued in prior periods as well as those issued during item a
