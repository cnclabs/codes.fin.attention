overview we are a leading global branded consumer company and the leading global provider of weight management services  with a presence in countries around the world 
with over four decades of weight management experience  expertise and know how  we have established weight watchers as one of the most recognized and trusted brand names among weight conscious consumers 
in  consumers spent over billion on weight watchers branded products and services  including meetings conducted by us and our franchisees  products sold at meetings  internet subscription products sold by weightwatchers 
com  licensed products sold in retail channels and magazine subscriptions and other publications 
on a consolidated basis  from fiscal through fiscal  our revenues and operating income have grown at a compound annual growth rate of and  respectively 
we currently have two operating segments weight watchers international and weightwatchers 
com 
since april   we have consolidated weightwatchers 
com  initially pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
r  variable interest entities  or  fin r and beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  pursuant to accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  as a result of increasing our ownership interest in weightwatchers 
com to a controlling interest as of july  and to a interest as of december  we derive our revenues principally from meeting fees 
members pay us a weekly fee to attend our meetings 
product sales 
we sell proprietary products that complement our weight management plans  such as bars  snacks  cookbooks  points value guides  weight watchers magazines and points calculators  primarily to members in our meetings and to our franchisees 
online revenues 
we generate revenue from our internet subscription products and from the sale of internet advertising 
licensing  franchise royalties and other 
we license the weight watchers brand and other intellectual property for certain foods and other products 
in addition  our franchisees typically pay us a royalty fee of of their meeting fee revenues 
we also generate revenues from our magazines and third party advertising in our publications 
other than online revenues  all of the foregoing sources of revenue are included in our weight watchers international operating segment 
the following table sets forth our revenues by category for fiscal    and revenue sources in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks meeting fees product sales online revenues licensing  franchise royalties and other total   from fiscal through fiscal  our revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 
this increase is principally a result of increased naco meeting attendance 
our naco meeting attendance  including the impact of our acquisitions  grew from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of 
this growth resulted from our program innovations  as well as our acquisitions of franchise operations over that period 
accelerated growth in continental europe 
from fiscal to fiscal  attendance in our continental european operations grew at a compound annual rate of as a result of adapting our business model to local conditions  implementing more aggressive marketing programs tailored to the local markets and increasing the number of meetings ahead of anticipated demand 
increased product sales 
global product sales have grown at a compound annual rate of from fiscal to fiscal as a result of our growing attendance and launching new products successfully 
in our meetings  we have increased average product sales per attendee from to over the same period 
consolidation of weightwatchers 
com 
effective april   we began consolidating weightwatchers 
com 
as a result of this consolidation  we have included million and million of weightwatchers 
com revenues in our results of operations for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
increased licensing revenues 
licensing revenues grew at a compound annual rate of from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of our increased focus on expanding the number of weight watchers branded products worldwide and the reversion to us at the end of the third quarter of fiscal of revenues from certain third party licenses which had been paid to heinz up until that time 
as shown in the chart below  our worldwide annual attendance including the aforementioned acquisitions of franchise operations in our company owned operations has grown by  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal meeting attendance in company owned operations in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal weeks weeks weeks weeks weeks north america united kingdom continental europe other international total beginning in late  our naco attendance growth was adversely affected by increased media exposure to and the resulting popularity of low carbohydrate diets  which continued through beginning in the third quarter of fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal  the declines in organic naco attendance excluding the impact of acquisitions versus prior year periods steadily improved from minus in the second quarter of fiscal to minus in the third quarter of fiscal to minus in the fourth quarter of fiscal and to minus in the first quarter of fiscal after that  naco attendance versus prior year periods moved into positive territory and has posted increases since  up  and in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
the third quarter of fiscal grew at a slower pace due to the impact of hurricane katrina and its aftermath 
with the decline in the low carb diet phenomenon  we believe that weight conscious consumers are now moving back to healthier  more balanced approaches to weight management  which should continue to benefit our business 
in the united kingdom  after four years of attendance increases  attendance declined to million  a decrease of  in fiscal  primarily as a result of the added complexity of a new program innovation 
we do not expect our uk attendance trend to improve until the second half of fiscal in continental europe  attendance increased million in fiscal primarily as a result of a program innovation in the third quarter 
we maintained this increased attendance in continental europe in fiscal we have maintained an annual gross margin in the weight watchers international operating segment of or more since fiscal our staff is usually paid on a commission basis and space is typically rented as needed 
moreover  we adjust the number of meetings according to demand  including seasonal fluctuations 
this variable cost structure has enabled us to maintain these high margins even as we have expanded the number of our meetings over this period 
when our attendance growth outpaces our meeting growth  our gross margins typically improve 
the weight watchers international operating segment has consistently generated operating income margin of or more since fiscal even while making significant investments in strengthening our management teams particularly in north america and continental europe and putting in place a stronger global marketing infrastructure 
performance indicators and market trends our management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and potential variability of our cash flows and earnings 
these key performance indicators include net revenues  which are an indicator of our overall business growth  attendance  meeting fee revenue per attendee and in meeting product sales per attendee  the number of weightwatchers 
com subscribers  and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  which is an indicator of the efficiency of our business and our ability to manage our business to budget 
we believe that our revenues and profitability can be sensitive to major trends in the weight management industry 
in particular  we believe that our business could be adversely impacted by the development of more favorably perceived or more effective weight management methods  including pharmaceuticals  the temporary emergence of fad diets  a failure to develop innovative new products and services  a decrease in the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs  and an impairment of the weight watchers brand and other intellectual property 
acquisitions acquisition of weightwatchers 
com on june   we entered into an agreement to acquire control of our licensee and affiliate  weightwatchers 
com 
on july and   we increased our ownership interest in weightwatchers 
com from approximately to approximately by i exercising warrants to purchase weightwatchers 
com common stock for a total purchase price of approximately million  ii acquiring shares of weightwatchers 
com common stock owned by the employees of weightwatchers 
com and other parties not related to artal through a merger of a subsidiary of ours with weightwatchers 
com for a total purchase price of approximately million and iii acquiring additional shares of weightwatchers 
com common stock  representing outstanding stock options then held by weightwatchers 
com employees  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
on june   weightwatchers 
com also entered into a redemption agreement with artal to purchase all of the shares of weightwatchers 
com owned by artal at the same price per share as we paid in the merger 
subsequently  on december   weightwatchers 
com redeemed all of its outstanding common stock held by artal for a total price of approximately million as provided in the redemption agreement 
weightwatchers 
com used cash on hand and the proceeds of the ww 
com credit facilities in the aggregate amount of million to finance this redemption  as well as pay related fees and expenses 
as a result of this redemption  we now own of weightwatchers 
com 
the transactions described above relating to weightwatchers 
com were evaluated  negotiated and recommended by a special committee of weight watchers international s board of directors consisting of its independent directors 
franchise acquisitions from time to time  we repurchase franchise territories 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have acquired nine franchise operations for a total of approximately million 
these acquisitions are typically accretive to our earnings per share 
for fiscal  the attendance of our remaining franchise operations accounted for approximately of total worldwide attendance at weight watchers meetings 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to inventories  the impairment analysis for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition we earn revenue by conducting meetings  selling products in our meetings and to our franchisees  selling internet subscription products  collecting commissions from franchisees  collecting royalties related to licensing agreements and selling advertising space in and copies of our magazine 
we charge non refundable registration fees in exchange for an introductory information session and materials we provide to new members in our meeting business 
revenue from these registration fees is recognized when the service and products are provided  which is generally at the same time payment is received from the customer 
revenue from meeting fees  product sales  commissions and royalties is recognized when services are rendered  products are shipped to customers and title and risk of loss pass to the customer  and commissions and royalties are earned 
advertising revenue is recognized when ads are published 
revenue from magazine sales is recognized when the magazine is sent to the customer 
deferred revenue  consisting of prepaid meeting fees and magazine subscription revenue  is amortized into income over the period earned 
discounts to customers  including free registration offers  are recorded as a deduction from gross revenue in the period such revenue was recognized 
weightwatchers 
com primarily generates revenue from monthly internet subscriptions 
subscription fee revenues are recognized over the period that products are provided 
one time sign up fees are deferred and recognized over the expected customer relationship period 
subscription fee revenues that are paid in advance are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
we grant refunds under limited circumstances and at aggregate amounts that historically have not been material 
because the period of payment of the refund generally approximates the period revenue was originally recognized  refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue when paid 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets finite lived intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of three to years 
effective december   we adopted sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  but instead  review these assets for potential impairment on at least an annual basis 
we performed fair value impairment testing as of december  and january  on our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that the carrying amounts of these assets did not exceed their respective fair values and therefore  no impairment existed 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
upon such an event  we would be required to record a corresponding charge  which would impact earnings 
we would also be required to reduce the carrying amounts of the related assets on our balance sheet 
we continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions and believe that these assumptions  which included an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  were appropriate 
derivative instruments and hedging prior to the extinguishment of our euro denominated senior subordinated notes in  we entered into forward and swap contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies in order to reduce currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
these contracts were used primarily to hedge payments arising from those foreign currency denominated obligations 
we currently enter into interest rate swaps to hedge a substantial portion of our variable rate debt 
these contracts are used primarily to reduce the risk associated with variable interest rate debt obligations 
we account for our hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its related amendments  sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which require that all derivative financial instruments be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
fair value adjustments for qualifying derivative instruments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and will be included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item 
fair value adjustments for non qualifying derivative instruments are recorded in our results of operations 
consolidation on january   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  to clarify when an entity should consolidate another entity known as a variable interest entity vie 
the standard required that  under certain circumstances  separate businesses with some common ownership be consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
upon adoption of the original fin  we did not meet those circumstances  and we therefore did not consolidate weightwatchers 
com s financial statements into our and prior reported financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued fin r  which replaced fin fin r is applicable for financial statements issued for reporting periods after march  fin r requires that an entity consolidate a vie if that enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  will receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  or both 
based on the revisions in fin r  we were required to reevaluate our relationship with our affiliate and licensee  weightwatchers 
com 
in the course of this reevaluation  we determined that weightwatchers 
com was a vie under fin r and that we were its primary beneficiary under this regulation 
effective april   we consolidated weightwatchers 
com 
in accordance with the provisions of fin r  we recorded a charge of million  including a tax charge of million  in the fiscal quarter ended april  for the cumulative effect of this accounting change 
this charge reflects the cumulative impact to our results of operations had weightwatchers 
com been consolidated since its inception in september beginning in our first fiscal quarter ended april   our consolidated balance sheet includes the balance sheet of weightwatchers 
com 
effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal  our consolidated statement of operations and statement of cash flows include the results of weightwatchers 
com 
all intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
as discussed above  weightwatchers 
com is now a wholly owned subsidiary of weight watchers international 
therefore  we consolidate of the results of weightwatchers 
com under the traditional rules of consolidation rather than under the provisions of fin r 
since we adopted fin r on the last day of the first quarter of fiscal  commencing in the second quarter of fiscal and forward  our quarterly consolidated results are comparable with respect to the inclusion of weightwatchers 
com s results 
income taxes deferred income taxes result primarily from temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
if it is more likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recognized 
we consider historic levels of income  estimates of future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a tax valuation allowance 
we also establish an appropriate level of additional provisions for income taxes in the event that certain positions  which we believe are fully supportable  are challenged by the tax authorities 
we adjust these additional provisions in light of changing facts and circumstances 
if our filing positions are ultimately upheld under audits by respective taxing authorities  the provision for income taxes in future years will reflect favorable adjustments 
capitalized software development we follow the provisions of aicpa statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  or sop  which requires the capitalization of certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software for internal use 
these costs are amortized to cost of revenue over a period of three years  the estimated useful life of the software 
we periodically evaluate for impairment capitalized software development costs by considering  among other factors  whether the software is still expected to provide substantive service potential  and whether a significant change is being made or will be made to the software 
weight watchers international results of operations as explained above under critical accounting policies  since april   we have consolidated weightwatchers 
com  initially pursuant to fin r and beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  pursuant to accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements as a result of our increased ownership interest in weightwatchers 
com 
comparison of fiscal weeks to fiscal weeks as a result of the july  transaction which increased weight watchers international s ownership in weightwatchers 
com from approximately to approximately  our consolidated results for fiscal include certain transaction related expenses 
the table below shows the consolidated income statements for fiscal and fiscal on a comparable basis adjusted for these transaction expenses

absent these expenses  net income was million as compared to million in fiscal while our fiscal consolidated results included months of weightwatchers 
com results  our fiscal consolidated results included only nine months of weightwatchers 
com due to the timing of the adoption of fin r at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal the impact of consolidating weightwatchers 
com for all four quarters in fiscal compared to the three quarters in fiscal represented million of the increase in total revenues  and million and million of the increase in gross profit and operating income  respectively  as described in more detail below 
net revenues were  million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from  million for fiscal the million increase was driven by a million increase in meeting fees  a million increase in online revenues including million attributable to the first quarter of fiscal which  as mentioned above  was not included in the consolidated results for the full fiscal year  a million increase in licensing revenues  and a million increase in product sales 
due to the timing of the adoption of fin r  our fiscal consolidated results included one quarter of weightwatchers 
com royalty income of million 
included in the million increase in net revenues is a benefit of approximately million from foreign currency exchange rates 
for fiscal  total meeting fees were million  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal total attendances increased reaching million versus million in the prior year period 
meeting fee growth outpaced attendance growth primarily as a result of price increases in naco and the united kingdom 
in naco  meeting fees for fiscal were million  up from million in the prior year 
naco meeting fee growth was primarily driven by a price increase in approximately of naco for the full year of fiscal  and an additional approximately of naco beginning in september  and by a increase in naco attendance over the comparable prior year period 
international company owned meeting fees were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal international meeting fee growth was primarily driven by attendance and meeting fee per attendee growth in continental europe  and by a price increase in the united kingdom 
on a local currency basis  international meeting fee revenues grew 
meeting fee growth in the united kingdom was negatively impacted due to lower attendances of  decreasing from million in fiscal to million in fiscal worldwide product sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal domestically  product sales rose million  or  to million in fiscal  despite the stronger growth in sales that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal related to the launch of the turnaround innovation in naco as is typical with a new innovation 
domestic product sales grew in the first half of fiscal and in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily as a result of refreshing our in meeting consumables and adding new offerings which have been well received 
internationally  product sales increased  or million  to million  also on the strength of new product introductions 
online revenues were million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal which included only nine months of weightwatchers 
com results due to the timing of our adoption of fin r 
growth in online revenues from the second to the fourth quarter of fiscal period versus the comparable nine months of was million  or  due to an increase in active end of period subscribers and a price increase in july our first quarter of fiscal consolidated results included million of online revenues 
other revenue  comprised primarily of licensing revenues and our publications  was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal licensing revenues increased million  or  due to the continued growth of our licensees around the world  the addition of new licensees and the full year benefit from the third party license royalties which reverted to us from heinz at the end of september on a comparable basis  excluding the impact of the reversion  licensing revenues increased 
additionally  as mentioned above  our fiscal consolidated results included million of weightwatchers 
com royalty income  due to the timing of the adoption of fin r 
franchise royalties were million domestically and million internationally for fiscal total franchise royalties were million  up from million in the prior year 
excluding the franchises acquired in fiscal  domestic franchise royalties increased  while international franchise royalties rose 
cost of revenues was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal gross profit margin of of sales in fiscal increased basis points from of sales in the prior year 
a number of factors contributed to this margin expansion price increases in naco and uk meeting fees and in the weightwatchers 
com subscription fee  less frequent discounting of product sales  and strong growth in our high margin licensing business 
further  weightwatchers 
com s margin has increased as it has leveraged its existing infrastructure while growing its business 
marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the inclusion of weightwatchers 
com in the first quarter of fiscal  typically when our highest marketing spend occurs  contributed nearly one third of the increase million versus the prior year 
the remainder of the increase in marketing spend is largely driven by timing 
in fiscal  we resumed in continental europe and the united kingdom our practice of launching  and therefore expensing  our january winter diet season direct marketing campaign in late december 
this practice had been interrupted in fiscal as a result  fiscal included two years of winter diet season direct marketing costs 
the costs for fiscal were expensed in first quarter of fiscal  and costs for fiscal were expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  marketing expenses were for fiscal  as compared to in the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million from million for fiscal during fiscal  we recorded million of non recurring transaction related expenses related to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in weightwatchers 
com 
these transaction related expenses were primarily compensation charges associated with the buyout of employee stock options  and expenses associated with the relocation of weightwatchers 
com s headquarters 
in addition  there are certain recurring transaction related expenses which will be ongoing  but declining  for the next few years 
these recurring expenses include amortization related to the acquired intangible assets with a definite life and compensation expense for restricted stock units granted to weightwatchers 
com employees in exchange for unvested weightwatchers 
com stock options 
during fiscal  we recorded million for these expenses 
excluding non recurring transaction related expenses  our selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  over the comparable period in fiscal  and from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal this increase comes primarily from the impact of strengthening our management team and higher performance bonuses for staff in most of our regions 
in addition  the consolidation of an additional quarter of weightwatchers 
com in fiscal as compared to fiscal added million 
operating income was million for fiscal adjusted for non recurring transaction related expenses  operating income for fiscal rose to million  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal the operating income margin for fiscal was 
on the adjusted basis  the operating income margin for fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal net interest charges increased  or million  to million for fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to higher interest rates  partially offset by the reduction in interest expense due to the redemption of the remaining million of our senior subordinated notes in october  and by slightly lower average debt balances in fiscal as compared to fiscal for fiscal  we reported other expense of million as compared to other income of million for fiscal the variance of million is primarily due to a first quarter fiscal loan repayment  made prior to our adoption of fin r  from weightwatchers 
com of million 
in fiscal  million of expenses were recorded associated with the early extinguishment of debt as a result of the first quarter fiscal refinancing of the wwi credit facility  undertaken to move a large portion of our fixed term loans to the revolver  and the third quarter fiscal repurchase and retirement of the remaining million of our senior subordinated notes 
these expenses included the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs from prior refinancings and the recognition of fees associated with these refinancing transactions 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was  as compared to for fiscal we recorded a tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal by reversing a million accrued tax liability recorded as a result of the september recapitalization and stock purchase transaction with heinz 
additionally  weightwatchers 
com benefited throughout fiscal from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  for which a full valuation allowance had previously been recorded  thus largely eliminating its income tax expense for that year 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  weightwatchers 
com recorded a million reversal of its deferred tax valuation allowance which resulted in a million tax expense benefit in that quarter 
comparison of fiscal weeks to fiscal weeks impact of fin r as a result of our adoption of fin r  we began consolidating the results of our affiliate and licensee  weightwatchers

com s income statement with ours began in the second quarter of fiscal  the impact on fiscal included weightwatchers 
com s results of operations  net of intercompany eliminations  for only the nine months ended january  the impact of the consolidation on fiscal was to add million in revenues and million of gross profit 
operating income for the year increased by million after incremental marketing expenses of million and selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
a scheduled loan repayment of million and interest income of million  which weight watchers international earned from weightwatchers 
com  was eliminated in the consolidation of intercompany activity 
in accordance with the provisions of fin r  we recorded a charge of million  including taxes  in the first quarter of fiscal this charge reflects the cumulative impact to our results of operations had weightwatchers 
com been consolidated since its inception in september for fiscal  the consolidation combined with the first quarter of fiscal cumulative effect of accounting change  including taxes  related to the adoption of fin r  resulted in an increase to diluted earnings per share of 
weight watchers international on a stand alone basis the remaining sections of this discussion will address only the results of weight watchers international and its majority owned subsidiaries and will exclude the impact of fin r and the consolidation of weightwatchers

net revenues were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal the increase in net revenues was driven by international attendance growth and more favorable foreign currency rates  partially offset by a decline in north america attendance 
on a worldwide basis  attendance at company owned meetings declined 
compared to the fiscal  meeting fees increased million  licensing revenues rose million  advertising revenue increased million  and we earned an additional million of royalties from our licensee  weightwatchers 
com 
franchise commissions were million lower than in fiscal as we continued our franchise acquisition program  adding two more in fiscal product sales declined million  as did publishing and other revenue by million 
included in the total million increase in net revenues was a benefit of approximately million from foreign currency exchange rates 
on a local currency basis  meeting fees and product sales in our international operations increased 
for fiscal  total meeting fees were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
attendances declined slightly to million from million in fiscal in naco  meeting fees were million for fiscal  down from million in fiscal including acquisitions  naco attendance for the year was lower than fiscal naco organic attendance declined 
the organic attendance comparison excludes the additional week in fiscal and any franchises that were acquired during either year 
we made four franchise acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal certain franchise territories of the ww group at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal  dallas and new mexico during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the washington dc area during the second quarter of fiscal and fort worth during the third quarter of fiscal the low carb diet fad  which escalated over the course of fiscal  and was extended during fiscal by food manufacturers heavily marketed introductions of related food products  had an impact on our north america business 
we believe that the appeal of these low carb diets has peaked and the phenomenon is now in decline 
the introduction of our turnaround program contributed to the improving attendance trends we saw in fiscal the declines in organic attendances in fiscal versus fiscal improved from minus in the second quarter to minus in the third quarter and minus in the fourth quarter 
international company owned meeting fees were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal the growth in meeting fees was primarily driven by attendance increases in continental europe of coupled with the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
product sales were million for fiscal  a decrease of million from million for fiscal while total domestic product sales declined million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily driven by the attendance decline  internationally  product sales increased to million 
international product sales rose on a local currency basis 
franchise royalties were million domestically and million internationally in fiscal total franchise royalties of million were down million  or  from million in fiscal the decrease resulted from the impact of having acquired four franchises in the united states since fiscal and from the general slowdown in the us business 
excluding the recently acquired franchises  domestic franchise royalties declined  while international franchise royalties rose 
revenue from advertising  licensing and other sources was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal licensing revenue increased million  up over fiscal  due to our continued focus on introducing a range of weight watchers branded products worldwide 
revenues from advertising  our weightwatchers 
com licensee and other sources contributed to the remainder of the increase 
cost of revenues was million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million for fiscal for fiscal  the gross profit margin of remained above the level  but was lower than the level of fiscal we made the strategic decision to keep the vast majority of our naco meetings open  despite the negative impact on our gross margin resulting from lower attendances per meeting due to our expectation of the decline in the low carb phenomenon 
we believe this expectation has proven to be correct 
marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  with the majority of the increase resulting from currency translation 
as a percentage of net revenue  marketing expenses were for fiscal  as compared to in fiscal  driven by the softness in revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from million in fiscal expenses were driven up by professional fees and expenses related to compliance with sarbanes oxley  as well as by a strengthening of our management team and increase in our headcount to drive the future growth of our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenues for fiscal  as compared to in fiscal operating income was million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from million for fiscal our operating income margin for fiscal on this stand alone basis was  as compared to in fiscal net interest charges were down  or million  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the repurchase and retirement in fiscal of most of our senior subordinated notes and the refinancing of the wwi credit facility at that time and again in fiscal lowered our interest expense significantly 
for fiscal  we reported other income of million  as compared to other expense of million for fiscal in fiscal  we received higher loan repayments from weightwatchers 
com  which increased our other income by million 
in fiscal  we incurred unrealized currency translation gains and losses associated with our senior subordinated notes until the majority were retired in the third quarter of fiscal this has resulted in a million decrease in this expense 
we recognized early extinguishment of debt expenses of million for fiscal as a result of the refinancing of the wwi credit facility and the repurchase and retirement of the balance of our senior subordinated notes 
these expenses included the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs from prior refinancings and the recognition of tender premiums and fees associated with these transactions 
in fiscal  when we repurchased and retired the majority of our senior subordinated notes  we recognized early extinguishment of debt expenses of million 
these included tender premiums of million  the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million and million of fees associated with the transaction 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal we recorded a tax benefit in fiscal by reversing a million accrued but no longer necessary tax liability recorded as a result of the september recapitalization and stock purchase transaction with heinz 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and january   the balance sheets of weightwatchers 
com are fully consolidated with weight watchers international  and therefore the consolidated balance sheets for both periods are comparable 
balance sheet comparing the balance sheet at december  with that at january   our cash balance decreased by million from million to of million 
our working capital deficit at december  was million compared to million at january  excluding cash  the working capital deficit increased by million

as of december   weight watchers international had debt of million and had additional availability under its million revolver of million 
as of december   weightwatchers 
com had debt of million 
our total debt outstanding was million at december  and million at january   respectively 
in january  we refinanced the wwi credit facility  moving a large portion of our term loans to the revolver 
this provided us with a greater degree of flexibility and the ability to more efficiently manage cash 
under this refinancing  our term loans were reduced from million to million and our revolver capacity was increased from million to million 
to complete the refinancing  we borrowed million under the revolver 
in october  we increased our net borrowing capacity by adding an additional term loan to the existing wwi credit facility in the amount of million  coterminous with the previously existing wwi credit facility 
these funds were initially used to reduce borrowings under our revolver  resulting in no increase to our net borrowing 
additionally  in october  we repurchased and retired the remaining balance of our senior subordinated notes

dividends on february   our board of directors authorized the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of per share of our common stock  which corresponds to an annual dividend rate of per share 
the initial quarterly dividend will be payable on april  to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  the wwi credit facility provides that we are permitted to pay dividends in an aggregate amount equal to million plus of our net income as defined in the credit agreement since december   so long as we are not in default under our credit agreement and so long as we have borrowing availability under the revolver of at least million 
we do not expect these restrictions to impair our ability to pay dividends  but they could do so 
contractual obligations we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases primarily for office and rent facilities 
consolidated rent expense charged to operations under all our leases for fiscal was approximately million 
the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our consolidated liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt principal interest operating leases total  due to the fact that all of our debt is variable rate based  we have assumed for purposes of this table that the interest rate on all of our debt as of december  remains constant for all periods presented 
debt obligations due to be repaid in the next months are expected to be satisfied with operating cash flows 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities  together with borrowings available under our revolver  will be sufficient for the next months to fund currently anticipated capital expenditure requirements  debt service requirements and working capital requirements 
acquisitions weightwatchers 
com acquisition pursuant to a merger agreement effective july   the last day of our second quarter  weight watchers international increased its ownership interest in weightwatchers 
com from approximately to approximately for a total cash outlay of million including million paid to weightwatchers 
com and million paid to the non artal shareholders 
further to this  on december   weightwatchers 
com redeemed all of the equity interests in weightwatchers 
com owned by artal for the aggregate cash consideration of million 
as a result of this redemption  weightwatchers 
com is a wholly owned subsidiary of weight watchers international

the acquisition was financed through cash from operations

stock transactions on october   our board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
on june   our board of directors authorized adding million to this plan 
the repurchase plan allows for shares to be purchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
no shares will be purchased from artal under the plan 
during fiscal and fiscal  we purchased million shares of common stock in the open market for a total purchase price of million  and in fiscal  we purchased million shares of common stock in the open market for a total purchase price of million 
factors affecting future liquidity any future acquisitions  joint ventures or other similar transactions could require additional capital and we cannot be certain that any additional capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure requirements  interest  principal and dividend payment obligations and working capital requirements and to comply with all of the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on our future operations  performance and cash flow 
these are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
off balance sheet transactions as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
related parties for a discussion of related party transactions affecting us  see item certain relationships and related transactions in part iii of this annual report on form k 
seasonality our business is seasonal  with revenues generally decreasing at year end and during the summer months 
our advertising schedule supports the three key enrollment generating seasons of the year winter  spring and fall  with winter having the highest concentration of advertising spending 
the timing of certain holidays  particularly easter  which precedes the spring diet season and occurs between march and april  may affect our results of operations and the year to year comparability of our results 
for example  in  easter will fall on april  which means that the pre summer diet season will begin later than it did in our operating income for the first half of the year is generally the strongest 
while weightwatchers 
com experiences similar seasonality in terms of new subscriber signups  its revenue tends to be less seasonal because it amortizes subscription revenue over the related subscription period 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
r  share based payment fas r  which replaces fas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
fas r eliminates the option of using the intrinsic value method to record compensation expense related to stock based awards to employees and instead requires companies to recognize the cost of such awards based on their grant date fair value over the related service period of such awards 
in april  the sec approved a new rule that amended the effective date of fas r for public companies  whereby we will now be required to  and we will  adopt this standard beginning in the first quarter of in accordance with the provisions of fas r  we have elected to apply the modified prospective transition method to all past awards outstanding and unvested as of the date of adoption and will recognize the associated expense over the remaining vesting period based on the fair values previously determined and disclosed as part of our pro forma disclosures 
we will not restate the results of prior periods 
prior to the effective date of fas r  we will continue to provide the pro forma disclosures for past award grants as required under fas we believe the level of incremental expense that will be recognized in accordance with fas r for fiscal will be approximately million 
however  the total expense recorded in future periods  including fiscal  will depend on several variables  including the number of stock based awards that are granted in future periods and the fair value of those awards 
the american jobs creation act of the ajca was enacted on october  and includes a special one time deduction of of certain foreign earnings repatriated to the united states 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the ajca  allowing companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the ajca on plans for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings 
this legislation did not have a material impact to our results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and interest rate changes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to interest expense of variable rate debt 
due to the repurchase and retirement of the remaining balance of our senior subordinated notes in  we no longer have any fixed rate borrowings outstanding at december  therefore  market interest rates no longer affect the fair value of our long term debt balances 
since of our debt is now variable rate based  any changes in market interest rates will cause an equal change in our net interest expense 
other than inter company transactions between our domestic and foreign entities  we generally do not have significant transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each entity 
from time to time we may enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge transactions denominated in foreign currencies to reduce the currency risk associated with fluctuating exchange rates 
realized and unrealized gains and losses from any of these transactions may be included in net income for the period 
in addition  we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge a substantial portion of our variable rate debt 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives will be recorded each period in earnings for non qualifying derivatives or accumulated other comprehensive income loss for qualifying derivatives 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may impact our shareholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of the euro will cause the us dollar translated amounts to change in comparison to prior periods 
each of our subsidiaries  other than weightwatchers 
com  derives revenues and incurs expenses primarily within a single country and  consequently  does not generally incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of normal business operations
