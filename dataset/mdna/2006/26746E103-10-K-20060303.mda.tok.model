item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel biotherapeutics for unmet medical needs  with an emphasis on cancer and inflammatory indications 
we use our proprietary drug discovery technology to identify antibody  small protein and peptide compounds for clinical development 
our lead product candidate  dx  is a recombinant form of a small protein that is currently in clinical trials for its therapeutic potential in two separate indications 
in collaboration with genzyme corporation  we have successfully completed two phase ii trials of dx for the treatment of hereditary angioedema hae 
in january   we treated our last patient in a third phase ii trial and we commenced a pivotal phase iii trial in december  independently  we have successfully completed a phase i ii trial of dx for the prevention of blood loss during certain on pump heart procedures  specifically coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery and we are currently in partnering discussions for further development of dx in this indication 
furthermore  as we continue to negotiate with potential partners  we have designed a phase iib study to be started as soon as practical to ensure the continuing development for this indication 
dx has orphan drug designation in the us and eu  as well as fast track designation in the us for the treatment of angioedema 
in addition to our clinical stage programs  we have other product candidates in our discovery and development pipeline  one of which is currently in formal development 
the most advanced of these product candidates is dx  a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the tie receptor  a protein receptor that scientists believe is important in the process of tumor blood vessel formation known as angiogenesis 
dx offers a novel mechanism of action for inhibiting tumor growth  which we believe may have potential application in the treatment of various types of cancer 
all of the compounds in our pipeline were discovered using our proprietary phage display technology which rapidly generates product candidates that bind with high affinity and specificity to therapeutic targets 
although this technology is used primarily to advance our own internal development activities  we also leverage this technology broadly with over revenue generating licenses and collaborations 
currently  our licensees and collaborators have product candidates in clinical trials that were generated from our technology and we estimate that over additional product candidates that were generated using our technology are in various stages of research and preclinical development 
we are entitled to receive milestones and royalties from our licensees and collaborators to the extent that any of these product candidates advance in development and are ultimately commercialized 
our business strategy is to build a broad portfolio of biotherapeutic products developed using our proprietary phage display technology 
in the near term  we expect to focus our efforts on completing the clinical development of dx for the treatment of hae and obtaining market approval of dx in the us in that indication in the second half of in addition  we expect to move forward on the clinical development of dx as a treatment for patients undergoing cabg surgery  and to advance up to three pre clinical product candidates  including dx  into development in in the long term  we expect that we  together with our licensees and collaborators  will continue to use our technology and expertise to identify and develop new products and work to bring those products to the marketplace on a regular basis 
we continued to incur losses in and expect to incur significant operating losses over at least the next several years and do not expect to generate profits until the therapeutic products from our development portfolio reach the market after being subjected to the uncertainties of the regulatory approval process 
clinical development programs dx for hae 
in collaboration with genzyme  we are developing dx as a treatment for hae 
this collaboration is managed through dyax genzyme llc formerly known as kallikrein llc  a jointly owned limited liability company 
in may  we successfully completed a phase ii  patient  dose escalating placebo controlled study  known as edema in january  we treated the last patient in third phase ii trial  known as edema  and we commenced a pivotal  placebo controlled  worldwide  multi center phase iii trial  known as edema  at the end of in connection with this commencement  we received a million milestone for the dosing of the first patient in this trial 
during  we completed the transition of our clinical trials to the more patient friendly subcutaneous route of administration  and we are now using this route of administration at all ongoing edema trial sites 
we also expect to seek marketing approval using this route of administration 
contingent on the successful and timely completion of the edema trial  we  together with genzyme  plan to commence filing a biologics license application bla in the second half of for regulatory approval by the fda of dx for the treatment of hae 
shortly after the completion of the fda submission  we plan to file a marketing authorization application with the european medicines agency seeking approval of dx for hae in the european union 
based on this timeline and contingent on the successful and timely completion of the edema trial  we anticipate being in a position to receive marketing approval of dx for hae in the united states in the second half of  followed by approval in the european union 
we estimate dyax genzyme llc s total remaining costs to commercialization to be in the range of million to million 
we will be responsible for funding one half of these costs  or approximately million to million 
the following table illustrates the activity associated with dx for hae included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss years ended december  in thousands dx for hae costs included within research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss less research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc per the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net research and development expenses for dx for hae equity loss in joint venture dyax genzyme llc separately classified within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss net loss on dx for hae program during  our research and development expenses on the dx for hae program totaled million compared with million in and million in research and development expenses increased million in over principally due to increased activity in the areas of manufacturing and clinical trial costs 
research and development expenses increased in over principally due to increased activity in the areas of manufacturing and preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies 
dyax genyzme llc became responsible for the reimbursement of all development expenses related to the hae program incurred after the completion of the first phase ii clinical trial for hae 
during  dyax genzyme llc reimbursed us for million of our research and development expenses 
this reimbursement is recorded as research and development expenses reimbursed by joint venture dyax genzyme llc in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
in and  dyax genzyme llc reimbursed us million and million  respectively  for our expenses relating to the program 
the million of net research and development expenses in for dx for hae represent costs we incurred prior to the initiation of the joint venture 
dyax genzyme llc had net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses represent the total research and development expenses incurred by dyax and genzyme on dx for hae 
our portions of the losses  accounted for under the equity method  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively and were proportional to our financial interest in the program 
our portions of the losses  referred to as our equity loss in joint venture  is separately classified within our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss
