item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with hei s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the general discussion of hei s consolidated results should be read in conjunction with the segment discussions of the electric utilities and the bank that follow 
hei consolidated executive overview and strategy the company s three strategic objectives  currently  are to operate the electric utility and bank subsidiaries for long term growth  maintain the annual dividend and increase the company s financial flexibility by strengthening the balance sheet and maintaining credit ratings 
hei  through heco and its electric utility subsidiaries  hawaii electric light company  inc helco and maui electric company  limited meco  supplies power to of the hawaii electric public utility market 
hei also provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to consumers and businesses through its bank subsidiary  asb  hawaii s third largest financial institution based on asset size 
in  income from continuing operations was million  compared to million in basic earnings per share from continuing operations were per share in  up from per share in due primarily to a after tax charge of million  or per share  as a result of a june tax ruling and subsequent settlement see bank franchise taxes sections below 
also impacting results in were lower electric utility earnings  partly offset by million higher net gains on investments and lower financing costs in the other segment 
the company s operations will be heavily influenced by hawaii s economy  which is driven by tourism  the federal government including the military  real estate and construction 
per the state of hawaii department of business  economic development and tourism dbedt  hawaii real gross state product grew by a forecasted in and is expected to grow by a forecasted in shareholder dividends are declared and paid quarterly by hei at the discretion of hei s board of directors 
hei and its predecessor company  heco  have paid dividends continuously since the dividend has been stable at per share annually since split adjusted 
the indicated dividend yield as of december  was 
hei s board believes that hei should achieve a payout ratio on a sustainable basis and that cash flows should support an increase before it considers increasing the common stock dividend above its current level 
the dividend payout ratios based on net income for  and were  and payout ratios of  and based on income from continuing operations  respectively 
the high payout ratio for was primarily due to the charge to net income of million due to a june adverse tax ruling and subsequent settlement and an increased number of shares outstanding from the sale of million shares pre split of common stock in march without the bank franchise tax charge  the payout ratio for would have been based on income from continuing operations 
in the first half of  hei strengthened its balance sheet through a common stock sale and repayment and refinancing of debt 
hei s subsidiaries from time to time consider various strategies designed to enhance their competitive positions and to maximize shareholder value 
these strategies may include the formation of new subsidiaries or the acquisition or disposition of businesses 
the company may from time to time be engaged in preliminary discussions  either internally or with third parties  regarding potential transactions 
management cannot predict whether any of these strategies or transactions will be carried out or  if so  whether they will be successfully implemented 
see the electric utility and bank sections for their respective executive overviews and strategies 

table of contents economic conditions note the statistical data in this section is from public third party sources eg  dbedt  eg census bureau and bloomberg 
because its core businesses provide local electric utility and banking services  hei s operating results are significantly influenced by the strength of hawaii s economy 
the state s economic growth  which is fueled by the two largest components of hawaii s economy tourism and the federal government  is forecast by the dbedt to be a moderate in it was a record year for tourism in hawaii with visitor days exceeding the record by 
in  visitor expenditures were billion  which is an increase over state economists expect continued growth in with projected increases of in visitor days and in visitor expenditures 
hawaii was the fifth ranking state in federal government expenditures per capita in the latest available data 
for the federal fiscal year ended september  latest available data  total federal government expenditures in hawaii  including military expenditures  were billion or  per capita  increasing and  respectively  over fiscal year military spending  which is of federal expenditures in hawaii  increased in compared to the real estate and construction industries in hawaii also influence hei s core businesses 
after five years of increases  real estate prices climbed again in  resulting in billion in total dollar residential resale volumes on oahu  a increase over the construction industry continues to remain healthy indicated by a increase in building permits in compared with local economists forecast contracting receipts to grow by in overall  the outlook for the hawaii economy remains positive 
however  economic growth is affected by the rate of expansion in the mainland us and japan economies and the growth in military spending  and is vulnerable to uncertainties in the world s geopolitical environment 
management also monitors oil prices because of their impact on the rates the utilities charge for electricity and the potential effect of increased prices of electricity on usage and interest rates because of their potential impact on asb s earnings  hei s and heco s cost of capital  pension costs and hei s stock price 
crude oil prices rose considerably during as strong demand from the us and china and geopolitical uncertainty continued 
futures prices began near per barrel and spiked to a high of per barrel in august in the wake of hurricane katrina 
prices moved down in the last quarter of the year as regional production in the gulf was restored 
more recently  however  prices are climbing due to political tension and uncertainty in oil producing countries such as iran and nigeria 
on february   crude oil futures closed at per barrel 
for most of  long term interest rates fluctuated in the to trading range and the short end of the yield curve continued to increase 
this resulted in a flattening yield curve throughout the year which is indicative of a difficult earning environment for asb 
as of december   the yield curve was inverted with a spread between the year and year treasuries of  compared to the yield curve as of december  with a spread of

stock split on april   hei announced a for stock split in the form of a stock dividend with a record date of may  and a distribution date of june  all share and per share information above  in the accompanying financial statements and notes and elsewhere in this report have been adjusted to reflect the stock split unless otherwise noted 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
bank franchise taxes consolidated hei the results of operations include an after tax charge of million  or per share  due to a june tax ruling and subsequent settlement as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under asb state franchise tax dispute and settlement 
the following table presents a reconciliation of hei s consolidated income from continuing operations to income from continuing operations excluding this million charge in and including additional bank franchise taxes in prior periods as if the company had not taken a dividends received deduction on income from its real estate investment trust reit subsidiary 
the company believes the adjusted information below presents results from continuing operations on a more comparable basis for the periods shown 
however  net income  or earnings per share  including these adjustments is not a presentation defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and may not be comparable to presentations used by other companies or more useful than the gaap presentation included in hei s consolidated financial statements

taking into account the adjustments in the table above  hei s consolidated income from continuing operations would have been flat compared to retirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefits the company s reported costs of providing retirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  retirement benefits costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age and compensation levels  the level of contributions to the plans  earnings and realized and unrealized gains and losses on plan assets and changes made to the provisions of the plans 
no changes were made to the retirement benefit plans provisions in  and that have had a significant impact on costs 
costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the company accounts for retirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and thus  changes in obligations associated with the factors noted above may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
the assumptions used by management in making benefit and funding calculations are based on current economic conditions 
changes in economic conditions will impact the underlying assumptions in determining retirement benefits costs on a prospective basis 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  the company considers the moody s daily long term corporate bond aa yield average which was as of december  compared to as of december  and changes in this rate from period to period 
in addition  the plans actuarial consultant prepared a cashflow matching analysis based upon bond information provided by standard poors for all high quality bonds ie  rated aa or better as of december   which supports the discount rate adopted as of december  in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  the company considers economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans primarily equity and fixed income investments  the plans asset allocations and the past performance of the plans assets 
for  the company s retirement benefit plans assets generated a total return  net of investment management fees  of  resulting in realized and unrealized gains of million  compared to million for and million for the market value of the retirement benefit plans assets as of december  was million 
the company made cash contributions to the retirement benefit plans totaling million in  million in and million in contributions are expected to total million in million by the utilities and million by asb  but actual contributions may differ 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates will result in changes in the market value of plan assets and may result in increased or decreased retirement benefits costs and contributions in future periods

if the company and consolidated heco are required to record significant charges to aoci and the prepaid pension assets that the electric utilities have been allowed to include in their rate bases for ratemaking purposes are eliminated in the future  the electric utilities returns on average rate base rors could increase and if the utilities exceeded the rors found by the puc to be reasonable  the rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge could be impacted  which may ultimately result in reduced revenues and lower earnings 
in december  the electric utilities submitted a request to the puc for approval to record and include in rate base the amount that would otherwise be charged to aoci and reduce stockholder s equity see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if the relief requested from the puc is not granted and the electric utilities are required to record significant charges to aoci  the company s and consolidated heco s financial ratios may deteriorate  which could result in security ratings downgrades and difficulty or greater expense in obtaining future financing 
there also may be possible financial covenant violations although there are no advances currently outstanding under any credit facility subject to financial covenants as certain bank lines of credit of the company and heco require that heco maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated equity to consolidated capitalization  excluding short term borrowings  of actual ratio of as of december   the company maintain a consolidated net worth  exclusive of intangible assets  of at least million actual net worth  exclusive of intangible assets  of billion as of december   and hei  on a non consolidated basis  maintain a ratio of indebtedness to capitalization of not more than actual ratio of as of december

the rate of inflation over the last two years has been trending upward and  although relatively low throughout this period  inflation continues to have an impact on hei s operations 
inflation increases operating costs and the replacement cost of assets 
subsidiaries with significant physical assets  such as the electric utilities  replace assets at much higher costs and must request and obtain rate increases to maintain adequate earnings 
in the past  the puc has generally approved rate increases to cover the effects of inflation 
the puc granted rate increases in for heco  in and for helco  and in for meco  in part to cover increases in construction costs and operating expenses due to inflation

the company believes that its ability to generate cash  both internally from electric utility and banking operations and externally from issuances of equity and debt securities  commercial paper and bank borrowings  is adequate to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the tables above  its forecasted capital expenditures and investments  its expected retirement benefit plan contributions and other cash requirements in the foreseeable future 

table of contents the company s total assets were billion as of december  and billion as of december  the consolidated capital structure of hei excluding asb s deposit liabilities  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb of seattle was as follows december dollars in millions short term borrowings long term debt  net preferred stock of subsidiaries common stock equity as of march   the standard poor s s p and moody s investors service s moody s ratings of hei securities were as follows s p moody s commercial paper a p medium term notes bbb baa the above ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold any securities  such ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
hei s overall s p corporate credit rating is bbb negative a the rating agencies use a combination of qualitative measures ie  assessment of business risk that incorporates an analysis of the qualitative factors such as management  competitive positioning  operations  markets and regulation as well as quantitative measures eg  cash flow  debt  interest coverage and liquidity ratios in determining the ratings of hei securities 
in april  s p affirmed its corporate credit ratings of hei  but revised its outlook from stable to negative  citing heco s need for a rate increase to cover its growing expenses and yet to be recovered investments 
see electric utility liquidity and capital resources below 
as of december   million of debt  equity and or other securities were available for offering by hei under an omnibus shelf registration and an additional million principal amount of series d notes were available for offering by hei under its registered medium term note program 
hei periodically utilizes short term debt  principally commercial paper  to support normal operations and for other temporary requirements 
hei also periodically makes short term loans to heco to meet heco s cash requirements and on behalf of helco and meco 
hei had an average outstanding balance of commercial paper for of million and had million outstanding as of december  management believes that if hei s commercial paper ratings were to be downgraded  it might not be able to sell commercial paper under current market conditions 
as of december   hei maintained bank lines of credit with four different banks totaling million all maturing in 
these lines of credit are maintained by hei principally to support the issuance of commercial paper  but also may be drawn for general corporate purposes 
accordingly  the lines of credit are available for short term liquidity in the event a rating agency downgrade were to reduce or eliminate access to the commercial paper markets 
lines of credit to hei totaling million contain provisions for revised pricing in the event of a ratings change eg  a ratings downgrade of hei medium term notes from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p and moody s  respectively  would result in a to basis points higher interest rate  a ratings upgrade from bbb baa to bbb baa by s p and moody s  respectively  would result in a to basis points lower interest rate 
there are no such provisions in hei s other lines of credit 
while each of the lines contain customary conditions that must be met in order to draw on them  none of hei s line of credit agreements contain clauses that would affect access to the lines by reason of a ratings downgrade  nor do they have broad material adverse change clauses that could affect access to the lines in the event of any material adverse event so long as any such event is timely disclosed 
as of december   the lines were undrawn 
to manage future liquidity needs  including short term liquidity for general corporate purposes and the refinancing of maturing long term debt  the company may seek to enter into new lines of credit  including multi year credit  syndicated and or bilateral facilities 
the company may also seek to increase the amount of credit available under such facilities as management deems appropriate

a portion of the net assets of heco and asb is not available for transfer to hei in the form of dividends  loans or advances without regulatory approval 
one of the conditions of the merger and corporate restructuring of heco and hei requires that heco maintain a consolidated common equity to total capitalization ratio of not less than  and restricts heco from making distributions to hei to the extent it would result in that ratio being less than 
in the absence of an unexpected material adverse change in the financial condition of the electric utilities or asb  such restrictions are not expected to significantly affect the operations of hei  its ability to pay dividends on its common stock or its ability to meet its debt or other cash obligations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
forecasted hei consolidated net cash used in investing activities excluding investing cash flows from asb for through consists primarily of the net capital expenditures of heco and its subsidiaries 
in addition to the funds required for the electric utilities construction program see electric utility liquidity and capital resources  approximately billion will be required during through to repay maturing hei medium term notes  which is expected to be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of medium term notes  issuance of commercial paper  issuance of common stock under the stock option and incentive plan and dividends from subsidiaries 
additional debt and or equity financing may be required to fund unanticipated expenditures not included in the through forecast  such as increases in the costs of or an acceleration of the construction of capital projects of the electric utilities  unbudgeted acquisitions or investments in new businesses  significant increases in retirement benefit funding requirements that might be required if there were significant declines in the market value of pension plan assets or changes in actuarial assumptions and higher tax payments that would result if tax positions taken by the company do not prevail 
in addition  existing debt may be refinanced prior to maturity potentially at more favorable rates with additional debt or equity financing or both 
as further explained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company maintains pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
funding for the qualified pension plans is based upon actuarially determined contributions that consider the amount deductible for income tax purposes and the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
the company was not required to make any contributions to the qualified pension plans to meet minimum funding requirements pursuant to erisa for  and  but the company s pension investment committee chose to make tax deductible contributions in those years 
the electric utilities policy is to comply with directives from the puc to fund the costs of the postretirement benefit plan 
these costs are ultimately collected in rates billed to customers 
the company reserves the right to change  modify or terminate the plans 
from time to time in the past  benefits have changed 
contributions to the retirement benefit plans totaled million in comprised of million made by the electric utilities  million by asb and million by hei corporate  million in and million in contributions to the retirement benefits plans are expected to total million in million by the utilities and million by asb 
depending on the performance of the assets held in the plans trusts and numerous other factors  additional contributions may be required in the future to meet the minimum funding requirements of erisa or to pay benefits to plan participants 
the company believes it will have adequate access to capital resources to support any necessary funding requirements 

table of contents following are discussions of the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources of the electric utility and bank segments 
additional segment information is shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
electric utility executive overview and strategy the electric utilities are vertically integrated and regulated by the puc 
the island utility systems are not interconnected  which requires that additional reliability be built into the systems  but also means that the utilities are not exposed to the risks of inter ties 
the electric utilities strategic focus has been to meet hawaii s growing energy needs through a combination of diverse activities modernizing and adding needed infrastructure through capital investment  placing emphasis on energy efficiency and conservation  pursuing renewable energy options and technology opportunities such as chp and dg and taking the necessary steps to secure regulatory support for their plans 
reliability projects  including projects to increase generation reserves to meet growing peak demand  remain a priority for heco and its subsidiaries 
on oahu  heco is in the early permitting stages for a new generating unit  which is projected to be placed in service in  and is making progress with plans to build the east oahu transmission project eotp  a needed alternative route to move power from the west side of the island 
the two phases of the eotp are scheduled to be completed in and the puc has approved heco s plans for a new energy management system and a new dispatch center on oahu  which are scheduled to be completed in and  respectively  and are estimated to cost million 
puc approvals have been obtained for the new outage management and customer information systems  which will also be integrated 
on the island of hawaii  after years of delay  the two megawatt mw combustion turbines at keahole are operating 
on the island of maui  construction is proceeding on the installation of an mw steam turbine at the maalaea power plant site and the turbine is expected to be operational later in further  the utilities are seeking puc approval for additional dsm rebate programs and considering additional dg at utility owned sites eg  substations as another measure to potentially help meet growing peak demand 
major infrastructure projects can have a pronounced impact on the communities in which they are located 
the electric utilities continue to expand their community outreach and consultation process so they can better understand and evaluate community concerns early in the process 
with large power users in the electric utilities service territories  such as the us military  hotels and state and local government  management believes that retaining customers by maintaining customer satisfaction is a critical component in achieving kilowatthour kwh sales and revenue growth over time 
the electric utilities have established programs that offer these customers specialized services and energy efficiency audits to help them save on energy costs 
in november  heco filed a request with the puc to increase base rates  primarily for costs relating to existing and proposed energy conservation and efficiency programs demand side management dsm programs  costs of capital improvement projects  the proposed purchase of additional firm capacity and energy  costs of other measures taken to address peak load increases  and increased operation and maintenance expenses 
interim rate relief was granted in late september the puc issued a bifurcation order separating heco s requests for approval and or modification of its existing and proposed dsm programs from the rate case proceeding into a new docket ee dsm docket and heco is continuing its existing dsm programs and cost recovery mechanisms pending the resolution of the ee dsm docket 
see most recent rate requests heco and other regulatory matters demand side management programs agreements with the consumer advocate 
in december  helco notified the puc that it intends to file a request for an electric rate increase in spring see most recent rate requests helco 
the electric utilities long term plan to meet hawaii s future energy needs includes their support of a range of energy choices  including renewable energy and new power supply technologies such as dg 
the puc has an ongoing competitive bidding proceeding and has issued an order in a dg proceeding see certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition consolidated competition electric utility 
heco s subsidiary  renewable hawaii  inc rhi  has initial approval from the heco board of directors to fund investments by rhi of up to million in selected renewable energy projects to help bring online commercially feasible renewable energy sources in hawaii 

table of contents net income for heco and its subsidiaries was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to increased operation and maintenance expenses including more extensive maintenance on generating units  which are getting older and are being run harder to meet the higher demand for electricity  and higher retirement benefits expense and higher depreciation expense due to investments in capital projects  partly offset by the impact of heco s interim rate increase in late september results of operations dollars in millions  except per barrel amounts change change revenues expenses fuel oil purchased power other operating income allowance for funds used during construction net income return on average common equity average price per barrel of fuel oil kilowatthour sales millions cooling degree days oahu number of employees at december the rate schedules of the electric utilities contain energy cost adjustment clauses through which changes in fuel oil prices and certain components of purchased energy costs are passed on to customers 
in  the electric utilities revenues increased by  or million  from primarily due to higher fuel prices million  interim rate relief granted by the puc in late september million and increased shareholder incentives and lost margins million  including the surcharge transferred to base rates in the interim rate relief granted in september kwh sales increased from primarily due to new load growth ie  increase in number of customers  largely offset by the impacts of cooler and less humid weather and major commercial repair and renovation projects 
cooling degree days for oahu were lower in compared to in addition  customers may have been moderating their energy usage in response to the electric utilities campaign to promote conservation and efficiency and possibly reacting to higher fuel prices reflected in electric bills 
the higher fuel prices are also reflected in the higher amount of customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues 
operating income in was million lower than in mainly due to higher other expenses  including higher maintenance and retirement benefit expenses 
fuel oil and purchased power expenses in increased by and  respectively  due primarily to higher fuel prices  which are generally passed on to customers 
other expenses increased in due to a or million increase in other operation expense  a or million increase in maintenance expense  a or million increase in depreciation expense  and a or million increase in taxes  other than income taxes  primarily due to the increase in revenues 
other operation expenses increased in when compared to due primarily to higher expenses for production operations including higher environmental expenses as there was a doh emission fee waiver in  which was not repeated in  transmission and distribution operations and retirement benefits 
pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for the electric utilities increased million over the same period in due in part to the hei pension investment committee s adoption of a basis points lower discount rate as of december  maintenance expenses increased due to higher production maintenance expense primarily due to generating plant maintenance and generating unit overhauls and higher transmission and distribution maintenance expense 
higher depreciation expense was attributable to additions to plant in service in including helco s ct and ct and heco s waiau fuel oil pipeline  offset in part by lower depreciation expense resulting from the puc s approval in september of rates and accounting methodology applicable to heco s depreciable assets on oahu 

table of contents the trend of increased other operation and maintenance o m expenses is expected to continue in as the electric utilities expect higher demand side management expenses that are generally passed on to customers through a surcharge and are being considered in the ee dsm docket and integrated resource planning expenses  higher employee benefit expenses  primarily for retirement benefits and higher production expense  primarily to meet higher demand levels and load growth achieved in and sustained in as a result of load growth on oahu and other factors  there currently is an increased risk to generation reliability 
existing units are running harder  resulting in more frequent and more extensive maintenance  at times requiring temporary shut downs of these units 
generation reserve margins during peak periods are lower than considered desirable in light of these circumstances 
the electric utilities have taken a number of steps to mitigate the risk of outages  including securing additional purchased power  adding distributed generation at some substations and encouraging energy conservation 
the marginal costs of supplying growing demand  however  are increasing because of the decreasing reserve margin situation  and the rate of cost increases is not likely to lessen until a proposed new generating unit on oahu is added in increased o m expense was one of the reasons heco filed a request with the puc in november to increase base rates 
in late september  heco received interim rate relief see most recent rate requests 
in  the electric utilities revenues increased by  or million  from primarily due to higher energy prices million and a increase in kwh sales of electricity million 
the increase in kwh sales from was primarily due to higher customer usage due in part to the strength in hawaii s economy including higher real personal income  lower unemployment  higher visitor days  increased military activity and stronger real estate market and warmer weather probably resulting in greater air conditioning usage 
cooling degree days were higher in compared to the higher energy prices are also reflected in the higher amount of customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues 
operating income was million lower than in mainly due to higher other expenses  primarily higher maintenance expenses 
fuel oil and purchased power expenses in increased by and  respectively  due primarily to higher fuel prices  which are generally passed on to customers  and more kwhs generated and purchased 
other expenses increased in due to a or million increase in other operation expense  a or million increase in maintenance expense  a or million increase in depreciation expense due to additions to plant in service in  and a or million increase in taxes  other than income taxes  primarily due to the increase in revenues 
other operation expenses increased in when compared to due primarily to higher administrative and general expenses  including increases in general liability reserves and workers compensation claims  and higher transmission and distribution line inspection expense  largely offset by lower retirement benefits expense and emission fees 
pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for the electric utilities were million lower than due primarily to the increase in plan assets as of december  compared to december  resulting from market performance and contributions of the electric utilities of million during maintenance expenses increased due to greater scope of generating unit overhauls  higher production corrective maintenance  and higher transmission and distribution maintenance work 
most recent rate requests the electric utilities initiate puc proceedings from time to time to request electric rate increases to cover rising operating costs and the cost of plant and equipment  including the cost of new capital projects to maintain and improve service reliability 
as of march   the return on average common equity roace found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent final rate decision for each utility was for heco decision order d o issued on december   based on a test year  for helco d o issued on february   based on a test year and for meco amended d o issued on april   based on a test year 
however  the roace used for purposes of the interim rate increase in heco s current rate case was 
for  the simple average roaces calculated under the rate making method and reported to the puc for heco  helco and meco were  and  respectively 
heco s actual roace is significantly lower than its allowed roace primarily because of increased o m expenses  which are expected to continue and 
table of contents could result in heco seeking rate relief more often than in the past 
the interim rate relief granted to heco by the puc in september see below  which was based in part on increased costs of operating and maintaining heco s system 
helco s roace will continue to be negatively impacted by ct and ct as electric rates will not change for the unit additions until helco files a rate increase application currently planned for spring and the puc grants helco rate relief 
as of march   the ror found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent final rate decision for each utility was for heco  for helco and for meco d os noted above 
however  the ror used for purposes of the interim d o in the current heco rate case is 
for  the simple average rors calculated under the rate making method and reported to the puc for heco  helco and meco were  and  respectively 
if  as discussed above  the utilities are required to record significant charges to aoci related to a minimum liability for retirement benefits  the electric utilities rors would increase and could impact the rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge  which may ultimately result in reduced revenues and lower earnings 
in december  the electric utilities submitted a request to the puc for approval to record as a regulatory asset and include in rate base the amount that would otherwise be charged to aoci and reduce stockholder s equity see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
heco 
in november  heco filed a request with the puc to increase base rates  or million in annual base revenues  based on a test year  a return on rate base and an return on average common equity 
heco requested approval of its proposed new energy efficiency ee dsm programs enhanced ee dsm programs  and associated utility incentive mechanism  in its rate case application 
the requested increase included transferring the cost of existing dsm programs from a surcharge line item on electric bills into base electricity charges  the costs of enhanced ee dsm programs  the costs of capital improvement projects completed since the last rate case  the proposed purchase of up to an additional mw of firm capacity and energy from kalaeloa partners  lp  the cost of other measures taken to address peak load increases arising out of economic growth and increasing electricity use  and increased o m expenses 
excluding the surcharge transfer amount  the requested net increase to customers was  or million 
in march  the puc issued a bifurcation order separating heco s requests for approval and or modification of its existing and proposed dsm programs from the rate case proceeding into a new docket 
the preliminary issues identified by the puc for the new ee dsm docket include whether  and if so  what  energy efficiency goals should be established  whether the proposed and or other dsm programs will achieve the established energy efficiency goals and be implemented in a cost effective manner  what market structures are most appropriate for providing these or other dsm programs  and for utility incurred costs  what cost recovery mechanisms and cost levels are appropriate 
the original parties participants in this docket included heco  the consumer advocate  the dod  the county of maui  two renewable energy organizations  an energy efficiency organization  and an environmental organization 
in june  however  the puc  on its own initiative  included helco  meco  kauai island utility cooperative and the gas company as parties to the docket  provided their participation is limited solely to the issues dealing with statewide energy policies 
the procedural schedule for this docket calls for the parties to file final statements of position with the puc in april panel hearings are scheduled to take place in june as a result of the bifurcation order  heco is continuing its existing dsm programs and cost recovery mechanisms under which program costs  shareholder incentives  and lost margins between rate cases are covered through a dsm surcharge 
relevant provisions of the stipulations under which the existing dsm programs have been extended continue to apply  including an agreement to cap the recovery of lost margins and shareholder incentives  if such recovery would cause heco to exceed the ror found to be reasonable by the puc 
the puc used a ror of in its interim d o discussed below 
an estimated million in revenue requirements for dsm program costs related to both the enhanced ee dsm programs and to the extent recovered through the dsm surcharge  the existing dsm programs  were thus removed from heco s rate increase request 

table of contents in september  heco  the consumer advocate and the dod reached agreement among themselves on most of the issues in the rate case proceeding  subject to puc approval 
the remaining significant issue among the parties was the appropriateness of including in rate base approximately million related to heco s prepaid pension asset  net of deferred income taxes 
later in the same month  the puc issued its interim d o with tariff changes effective september  and amounts collected refundable  with interest  to ratepayers to the extent they exceed the amount approved in the final d o 
for purposes of the interim d o  the puc included heco s prepaid pension asset in rate base with a rate increase impact of approximately million 
the following amounts were included in heco s rebuttal  the consumer advocate s and the dod s testimonies and exhibits as adjusted to exclude the transferred surcharge amount of million  the settlement agreement described below  and the puc s interim d o pre settlement dollars in millions heco rebuttal consumer advocate department of defense heco per settlement interim increase net additional revenues roace ror average rate base effective september   subject to refund with interest pending the final outcome of the case 
excludes million transferred from a surcharge to base rates for existing energy efficiency programs 
the adoption of revenue  expense  rate base and cost of capital amounts including the roace and ror for purposes of an interim rate increase does not commit the puc to accept any such amounts in its final d o 
helco 
in december  helco notified the puc that it intends to file a request for an electric rate increase in spring preliminary estimates of the request are approximately  however  it is expected that by using a proposed new tiered rate structure  most residential users would see smaller increases in the range of to 
the tiered rate structure is designed to minimize the increase for residential customers using less electricity and is expected to encourage customers to take advantage of solar water heating programs and other energy management options 
the proposed rate increase would pay for improvements made to increase reliability  including transmission and distribution line improvements and the two generating units at the keahole power plant ct and ct 
with energy efficiency and conservation  distributed generation and renewable energy options  management expects that ct and ct should be the last fossil fuel burning units on the island of hawaii for the foreseeable future 
the next planned generating unit to provide firm power available hours for the island will be the last phase of the combined cycle plant at keahole  which will use waste heat from existing units and no additional fossil fuel 
among the renewable energy projects on the island of hawaii is the mw hawi renewable development wind farm and the planned expansion of the apollo wind farm from mw to approximately mw which may be delayed 
future projects for firm renewable purchased energy potentially include an expansion of a geothermal plant  a woodchip burning plant  a county waste to energy plant and a pumped storage hydro plant 
other renewable sources include photovoltaics and  when commercially available  ethanol 
the earliest any increase  if allowed  may go into effect is expected to be in early depreciation rates and accounting in october  heco filed an application with the puc for approval to change its depreciation rates based on a study of depreciation expense for and to change to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts 
in march  heco and the consumer advocate reached an agreement  which the puc approved in september in accordance with the agreement  heco changed its depreciation rates and changed to vintage amortization accounting for selected plant accounts effective september   resulting in slightly lower depreciation in the remainder of than would have been recorded under the previous rates and method 

table of contents other regulatory matters demand side management programs lost margins and shareholder incentives 
heco  helco and meco s energy efficiency dsm programs  currently approved by the puc  provide for the recovery of lost margins and the earning of shareholder incentives 
lost margins are accrued and collected prospectively based on the programs forecasted levels of participation  and are subject to two adjustments based on the actual level of participation and the results of impact evaluation reports 
the difference between the adjusted lost margins and the previously collected lost margins are subject to refund or recovery  with any over or under collection accruing interest at heco  helco or meco s authorized rate of return on rate base 
heco  helco and meco filed a portion of the impact evaluation report for the period with the puc in november and adjusted the lost margin recovery in the second quarter of the study methodology for the remaining portion of the impact evaluation report which evaluates the level of the dsm programs free ridership and corresponding energy and demand impacts that would have occurred anyway in the absence of the dsm programs  is under discussion with the consumer advocate 
to date  adjustments required for lost margins have not had a material effect on heco  helco or meco s financial statements 
shareholder incentives are accrued currently and collected retrospectively based on the programs actual levels of participation for the prior year 
beginning in  shareholder incentives collected are subject to retroactive adjustment based on the results of impact evaluation reports  similar to the adjustment process for lost margins 
demand side management programs agreements with the consumer advocate 
in october  heco and the consumer advocate finalized agreements  subject to puc approval  for the continuation of heco s three commercial and industrial dsm programs and two residential dsm programs until heco s next rate case 
these agreements were in lieu of heco continuing to seek approval of new year dsm programs and provided that dsm programs to be in place after heco s next rate case are to be determined as part of the case 
under the agreements  heco agreed to cap the recovery of lost margins and shareholder incentives if such recovery would cause heco to exceed its current authorized return on rate base ie the rate of return on rate base found by the puc to be reasonable in the most recent rate case for heco 
heco also agreed it will not pursue the continuation of lost margins recovery and shareholder incentives through a surcharge mechanism in future rate cases 
in october  helco and meco reached similar agreements with the consumer advocate and filed requests to continue their four existing dsm programs 
as previously discussed  as a result of the bifurcation order in heco s rate case  heco is continuing its existing dsm programs and cost recovery mechanisms  including the recovery of program costs  shareholder incentives and lost margins through a surcharge mechanism  pending the resolution of the ee dsm docket 
in the ee dsm docket  heco has requested puc approval on an interim basis for certain modifications to its existing dsm programs  and a new interim dsm program interim dsm proposals 
heco did not request shareholder incentives and lost margins for its proposed new interim dsm program  but did so for its existing programs 
on january   the consumer advocate filed comments on heco s interim dsm proposals  which included an objection to the continued recovery of shareholder incentives and lost margins 
heco filed its response to the consumer advocate s comments on january   reaffirming its position that the continuation of shareholder incentives and lost margins is appropriate and in conformance with the puc s order allowing the continuation of its existing dsm programs pending the resolution of the ee dsm docket 
the issue of the continuation of shareholder incentives and lost margins  or alternative incentive mechanisms  will be determined by the puc as part of the ee dsm docket 
at this time the puc has not issued a decision on heco s interim dsm proposals 
in november  the puc issued orders one of which was later amended that  subject to certain reporting requirements and other conditions  approved the agreements regarding the temporary continuation of heco s five existing dsm programs until heco s next rate case and the agreements regarding the temporary continuation of helco s and meco s dsm programs until one year after the puc makes a revenue requirements determination in heco s next rate case 
under the orders  however  helco and meco are allowed to recover only lost margins and shareholder incentives accrued through the date that interim rates are 
table of contents established in heco s next rate case  but may request to extend the time of such accrual and recovery for up to one additional year 
in the first half of  helco and meco plan to file a request to confirm that the bifurcation order in heco s rate case had the effect of postponing the deadline for the recovery of helco and meco s lost margins and shareholder incentives until resolution of the ee dsm docket or  in the alternative  a request for extension of the recovery period for another year 
one of the conditions to the interim continuation of the dsm programs requires the utilities and the consumer advocate to review  every six months  the economic and rate impacts resulting from implementing the agreement 
in and  none of the electric utilities exceeded their respective authorized rors 
in  only meco exceeded its authorized ror  resulting in a reduction of revenues from shareholders incentives and lost margins for by million recorded in december 
in reviewing helco s ror for  the consumer advocate raised an issue regarding keahole settlement expenses and helco agreed to refund  with interest  all of the lost margins and shareholder incentives it had earned in in june  helco recorded reduced revenues of million to reflect the lost margins and shareholder incentives for that were refunded to ratepayers in august in  heco and the consumer advocate reached agreement on a residential load management program and a commercial and industrial load management program and the puc approved heco s programs 
implementation of these programs began in early the residential load management program includes a monthly electric bill credit for eligible customers who participate in the program  which allows heco to disconnect the customer s residential electric water heaters from heco s system to reduce system load when deemed necessary by heco 
the commercial and industrial load management program provides an incentive on the portion of the demand load that eligible customers allow to be controlled or interrupted by heco 
in addition  if heco interrupts the load  an incentive is paid on the kilowatthours interrupted 
avoided cost generic docket 
in may  the puc instituted a generic investigation  including all of hawaii s electric utilities  to examine the proxy method and formula used by the electric utilities to calculate their avoided energy costs and schedule q rates 
in general  schedule q rates are available to customers with cogeneration and or small power production facilities with a capacity of kwhs or less who buy sell power from to the electric utility 
the parties to the docket include the electric utilities  the consumer advocate  the dod  and representatives of existing or potential ipps 
in march  the parties entered into and filed a stipulation to resolve proceedings  which is subject to puc approval 
the parties could not reach agreement with respect to certain of the issues  which are addressed in statements of position filed in march in july  the puc ordered the parties to review and update the agreements  information and data contained in the stipulation and file such information 
the parties have until may  to file 
integrated resource planning  requirements for additional generating capacity and adequacy of supply 
the puc issued an order in requiring the energy utilities in hawaii to develop integrated resource plans irps 
the goal of integrated resource planning is the identification of demand and supply side resources and the integration of these resources for meeting near and long term consumer energy needs in an efficient and reliable manner at the lowest reasonable cost 
the utilities have characterized their proposed irps as planning strategies  rather than fixed courses of action  and the resources ultimately added to their systems may differ from those included in their year plans 
under the puc s irp framework  the utilities are required to submit annual evaluations of their plans including a revised five year program implementation schedule and to submit new plans on a three year cycle  subject to changes approved by the puc 
prior to proceeding with the dsm programs  separate puc approval proceedings must be completed 
see demand side management programs agreements with the consumer advocate above  which includes a discussion of the electric utilities residential and commercial and industrial load management programs 
the utilities are entitled to recover all appropriate and reasonable integrated resource planning and implementation costs  including the costs of dsm programs  either through a surcharge or through their base rates 
incremental irp costs are deferred until approved for recovery  at which time they are amortized to expense 
under procedural schedules for the irp cost proceedings  the utilities can begin recovering their incremental irp costs in the month following the filing of their actual costs incurred for the year  subject to refund with interest pending the puc s final d o approving recovery of the costs 

table of contents the consumer advocate has objected to the recovery of million before interest of the million of incremental irp costs incurred during the period  and the puc s decision is pending on this matter 
as of december   the amount of revenues  including interest and revenue taxes  that the electric utilities recorded for irp cost recoveries  subject to refund with interest  amounted to million 
heco s irp 
in october  heco filed its third irp irp  which proposes multiple solutions to meet oahu s future energy needs  including renewable energy resources  energy efficiency  conservation  technology such as chp and dg and central station generation 
in june  heco filed with the puc an application for approval of funds to build a new nominal mw simple cycle combustion turbine generating unit at campbell industrial park and an additional kilovolt transmission line to transmit power from the new unit and existing generating units at campbell industrial park to the oahu electric grid 
plans are for the combustion turbine to be run primarily as a peaking unit beginning in  and to burn naphtha or diesel  but will have the ability to convert to using biofuels  such as ethanol  when they are commercially available 
on december   heco signed a contract with siemens for the right to purchase up to two combustion turbine units 
the contract allows the company to terminate the contract at a specified payment amount if necessary combustion turbine ct project approvals are not obtained 
preliminary costs for the new generating unit and transmission line  as well as related substation improvements  are estimated at million 
as of december  accumulated project costs for planning  engineering  permitting and afudc amounted to million 
heco is now preparing an environmental impact statement for the proposed project 
in a related application filed with the puc in june  heco requested approval for an approximately million package of community benefit measures to mitigate the impact of the new generating unit on communities near the proposed generating unit site 
these measures include a base electric rate discount for those who live near the proposed generation site  additional air quality monitoring stations  a fish monitoring program and the use of recycled instead of potable water in kahe power plant s operations 
in september  the puc suspended heco s campbell industrial park generating unit and transmission line additions application to allow more time to review the application 
also in september  the puc ordered heco and the consumer advocate to submit a stipulated prehearing order for the community benefits application 
in january  the puc granted an environmental group s motion to intervene and a neighboring business entity s motion to participate in the generating unit and transmission line application  and ordered heco  the consumer advocate and the other parties the environmental group and the business entity to submit a stipulated prehearing order by march  irp also includes plans to build a mw coal unit in in addition  all existing generating units are currently planned to be operated future environmental considerations permitting beyond the year irp planning period 
meco s irp 
meco filed its second irp with the puc in may  and updated it in and on the supply side  meco s second irp focused on the planning for the installation of approximately mw of additional generation through the year on the island of maui  including mw of generation at its maalaea power plant site in increments from  mw at its new waena site in increments from  beginning with a mw combustion turbine in currently planned to be added in  and mw from the acquisition of a wind resource in currently  meco expects to begin purchasing mw of wind energy in 
approximately mw of additional generation through the year is planned for each of the islands of lanai and molokai 
meco completed the installation of a mw increment the second at maalaea in september  and the final increment of mw  which was originally expected to be installed in  is currently expected to be installed in the third quarter of meco s third irp is scheduled to be filed with the puc in october helco s irp 
in september  helco filed its second irp with the puc  and updated it in and 
on the supply side  helco s second irp focused on the planning for generating unit additions after near term additions 
the near term additions proposed in helco s second irp included installing two mw cts at its keahole power plant site the installation of which were delayed  but were put into limited commercial operation in may and june and proceeding in parallel with a ppa with hamakua energy partners  lp hep for a mw 
table of contents net dual train combined cycle dtcc facility which was completed in december 
helco has deferred the retirements of some of its older generating units 
helco s current plans are to install an mw heat recovery steam generator st in or earlier 
after the installation of st  the target date for the next firm capacity addition is the timeframe 
helco s third irp is scheduled to be filed with the puc by december  adequacy of supply 
heco 
as a result of load growth and other factors  heco s adequacy of supply letter filed in march concluded that generation reserve margins  although substantial  were lower than is considered desirable on oahu under the circumstances  and that there currently was an increased risk to generation reliability 
also  the letter stated that the risk of having generation related customer outages would be higher if the peak reduction impacts of planned energy efficiency dsm programs  load management programs or chp installations fall short of achieving their forecasted benefits 
this situation is expected to continue  if the peak demand continues to grow as forecasted  at least until  which is the earliest that heco expects to be able to install its planned combustion turbine 
the letter also indicated that heco was working on plans to implement a number of potential interim mitigation measures  such as installing portable leased  distributed mw generating units at substations or other sites which were installed in the fourth quarter of and initiating a customer demand response program to supplement its load management programs for which heco plans to request approval in the first half of 
heco did not experience actual generation shortfalls causing customer load shedding in  in part because peak loads were lower than forecast in the second half of heco s adequacy of supply letter filed in march indicates that heco s latest analysis estimates the reserve capacity shortfall to be between mw and mw in the to period  which is significantly larger than the to mw reserve capacity shortfall projected in the adequacy of supply letter 
the increase in projected reserve capacity shortfall is largely due to the lower projected availability of existing generating units  and a reduction in the projected impacts from planned peak reduction measures 
generating units may be entirely or partially unavailable to serve load during scheduled overhaul periods and other planned maintenance outages  or when they trip or are taken out of operation or their output is de rated due to equipment failure or other causes 
while the availability rates for generating units on oahu remain better than those of comparable units on the us mainland  the availability rates have declined in and based on this experience  the manner in which the units must be operated when there is a reserve capacity shortfall  and the increasing ages of the units  heco expects this situation to continue in the near term and is forecasting lower availability rates than were used in the analyses 
to mitigate the projected reserve capacity shortfalls and to increase generating unit availability going forward  heco is continuing to plan and implement mitigation measures  such as installing additional distributed generators at substations or other sites  seeking approval for additional load management and other demand reduction measures  and pursuing efforts to improve the availability of generating units 
heco will operate at lower than desired reliability levels and take steps to mitigate the reserve capacity shortfall situation until the next generating unit is installed 
until sufficient generating capacity can be added to the system  heco will experience a higher risk of generation related customer outages 
given the magnitude of the projected reserve capacity shortfall  heco also will evaluate the need to file an application with the puc for approval to add more firm capacity over and above the puc application filed in june for a simple cycle combustion turbine 
meco 
meco s adequacy of supply letter filed in march indicated that meco s maui island system should have sufficient installed capacity to meet the forecasted loads 
however  in december  meco s maalaea unit  a mw diesel generator suffered an equipment failure and the unit is not expected to be available for service until approximately june until maalaea unit returns to service  the maui island system at times may not have sufficient capacity in the event of an unexpected outage of the largest unit 
meco will implement appropriate mitigation measures to overcome insufficient reserve capacity situations 
helco 
helco s adequacy of supply letter filed in february indicated that helco s generation capacity for the next three years  through  is sufficiently large to meet all reasonably expected demands for service and provide reasonable reserves for emergencies 

table of contents collective bargaining agreements each of the electric utilities entered into a new four year collective bargaining agreement in with the union which represents approximately of electric utility employees 
see collective bargaining agreements in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
legislation and regulation congress and the hawaii legislature periodically consider legislation that could have positive or negative effects on the utilities and their customers 
for example  although it is currently stalled in a house senate conference committee  comprehensive energy legislation is still before congress that could increase the domestic supply of oil as well as increase support for energy conservation programs and mandate the use of renewables by utilities 
energy policy act of on august   the president signed into law the energy policy act of the act 
the act provides billion in tax incentives over a year period designed to boost conservation efforts  increase domestic energy production and expand the use of alternative energy sources  such as solar  wind  ethanol  biomass  hydropower and clean coal technology 
ocean energy sources  including wave power  are identified as renewable technologies 
section of the act authorizes a study by the us department of energy of hawaii s dependence on oil  however  that provision is subject to appropriation  as is million authorized under section for a sugar cane ethanol program in hawaii 
incentives also include tax credits and shorter depreciable lives for many assets associated with energy production and transmission 
the act s primary direct impact on heco and its subsidiaries is currently expected to be the reduction in the depreciable tax life  from years to years  of certain electric transmission equipment placed into service after april  public utility holding company act of act and public utility holding company act of act 
the repeal of the act  effective february   eliminates significant federal restrictions on the scope  structure and ownership of electric utilities 
some believe that the repeal will result in increased institutional ownership of and private equity and hedge fund investments in public utilities  increased consolidation in the industry  more federal energy regulatory commission ferc oversight  and additional diversification by electric utilities 
the increased oversight by ferc results in part from the adoption of the act  which provides for ferc access to the books and records of utility holding companies and  absent exemptions or waivers  imposes certain record retention and accounting requirements on public utility holding companies 
hei and heco have filed a notification claiming a waiver of such requirements as single state public utility holding companies 
regulation and oversight of heco and its subsidiaries by the puc  however  remains unchanged 
renewable portfolio standard 
the hawaii legislature adopted a law that required the utilities to meet a renewable portfolio standard rps of by december  heco  helco and meco are permitted to aggregate their renewable portfolios in order to achieve these standards 
the electric utilities met this standard with over of the utilities consolidated electricity sales for from renewable resources as defined under the rps law 
the hawaii legislature amended the rps law to require electric utilities to meet a renewable portfolio standard of by december   by december   by december   and by december  in  the electric utilities attained over of sales from renewable sources 
the puc has to determine if an electric utility is not able to meet the standard in a cost effective manner or due to circumstances beyond its control 
if such a determination is made  the utility is relieved of its responsibility to achieve the standard for that period of time 
the puc also may provide incentives to encourage electric utility companies to exceed their rps or to meet their rps ahead of time  or both 
the rps law also directs the puc  by december   to develop and implement a utility ratemaking structure  which may include  but is not limited to  performance based ratemaking pbr  to provide incentives that encourage hawaii s electric utility companies to use cost effective renewable energy resources found in hawaii to meet the rps  while allowing for deviation from the standards in the event that the standards cannot be met in a cost effective manner  or as a result of circumstances beyond the control of the utility which could not have been reasonably anticipated or ameliorated 
on november   the puc transmitted an initial concept paper  electric utility rate design in hawaii  describing the puc s intended methodology for fulfilling the legislative mandate to formulate an electric utility rate design by december   that enables the achievement of rps  encourages investments in renewable 
table of contents energy facilities  conforms to the existing regulatory regime  which is cost of service regulation  or to alternative regulatory regimes  such as pbr  and provides utilities an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return 
the overall process envisioned by the puc is the conduct of three sets of workshops two sets of which have been completed  and the creation of a document that forms the basis of a set of rules to be adopted in a conventional rulemaking process to follow  providing input to the puc s decisions on electric utility ratemaking 
on july   the puc transmitted a second concept paper scp authored by economists incorporated ei  proposals for implementing renewable portfolio standards in hawaii  which identified incentive regulation ir mechanisms  including renewable energy credit trading  alternative compliance fees  penalties and positive incentives 
subsequently  other ir mechanisms were proposed 
management cannot predict the outcome of this process 
the electric utilities continue to pursue a three pronged renewable energy strategy a promote the development of cost effective  commercially viable renewable energy projects  b facilitate the integration of intermittent renewable energy resources  and c encourage renewable energy research  development  and demonstration projects eg  photovoltaic energy and the electronic shock absorber for wind generation 
they are also conducting integrated resource planning to evaluate the increased use of renewables within the electric utilities service territories 
among the various ways that the electric utilities support renewable energy are solar water heating and heat pump programs and the negotiation and execution of purchased power contracts with nonutility generators using renewable sources eg  refuse fired  geothermal  hydroelectric and wind turbine generating systems 
heco filed and received a patent in february for an electronic shock absorber esa that addresses power fluctuations from wind resources 
an esa demonstration system has been installed and is currently being tested at helco s lalamilo wind farm 
heco has sought protection of intellectual property rights in its esa technology  including a portfolio of us and international patents and patent filings 
heco has an intellectual property license agreement with the party constructing the esa demonstration system 
management cannot predict the amount of royalties heco may receive from the sale of esas in the future 
in december  heco formed an unregulated subsidiary  rhi  with initial approval to invest up to million in selected renewable energy projects 
rhi is seeking to stimulate renewable energy initiatives by prospecting for new projects and sites and taking a passive  minority interest in third party renewable energy projects greater than mw in hawaii 
since  rhi has periodically solicited competitive proposals for investment opportunities in qualified projects 
to date  rhi has signed a conditional investment agreement for a small scale landfill gas to energy project on oahu 
rhi has also signed a framework agreement for evaluation of three wind projects and two pumped storage hydroelectric projects on three islands 
project investments by rhi will generally be made only after developers secure the necessary approvals and permits and independently execute a ppa with heco  helco or meco  approved by the puc 
net energy metering 
hawaii has a net energy metering law  which requires that electric utilities offer net energy metering to eligible customer generators ie  a customer generator may be a net user or supplier of energy and will make payment to or receive credit from the electric utility accordingly 
the legislature amended the net energy metering law by expanding the definition of eligible customer generator to include government entities  increasing the maximum size of eligible net metered systems from kilowatts kw to kw  and limiting exemptions from additional requirements for systems meeting safety and performance standards to systems of kw or less 
these amendments could have a negative effect on electric utility sales 
however  based on experience under the kw limit and assessment of market opportunity for kw applications  management does not expect any such effect to be material 
other legislation 
a number of bills on energy were introduced in the hawaii state legislative session 
the majority of measures contained in these bills do not negatively affect the electric utilities  and the electric utilities support many of the measures that would encourage the more efficient use of energy and the use of hawaii s renewable energy resources 
the electric utilities also are actively engaged in deliberations before the legislature on matters that may affect them if adopted  such as bills that would direct the puc to review and consider alternatives to the current energy cost adjustment clause  require the outsourcing of demand side management programs  require the use of long term fixed price power purchase contracts for renewable energy generators  or 
table of contents modify the renewable portfolio standards law 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the outcome of those deliberations 
for a discussion of environmental legislation and regulations  see certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition consolidated environmental matters below 
other developments to evaluate the technical feasibility of the broadband over power line bpl technology and its applications  heco completed a small scale trial of the bpl technology 
based on the favorable results of the trial  heco is proceeding with a pilot in an expanded residential commercial area in honolulu  which is expected to run through at least the second quarter of bpl enabled utility applications being evaluated include distribution system line monitoring  advanced remote metering  residential direct load control and monitoring of distribution substation equipment 
although its evaluation will be focused primarily on utility applications of bpl  heco is also evaluating broadband information services that might potentially be provided by other service providers 
in october  the federal communications commission fcc released a report and order that amended and adopted new rules for access broadband over power line systems access bpl and stated that an fcc goal in developing the rules for access bpl are therefore to provide a framework that will both facilitate the rapid introduction and development of bpl systems and protect licensed radio services from harmful interference 
currently  there are no puc regulations for electric utility applications of bpl systems

these lines of credit are principally maintained by heco to support the issuance of commercial paper  but also may be drawn for general corporate purposes 
accordingly  the lines of credit are available for short term liquidity in the event a rating agency downgrade were to reduce or eliminate access to the commercial paper markets 
while each of the lines contain customary conditions that must be met in order to draw on them  none of heco s line of credit agreements contain clauses that would affect access to the lines by reason of a ratings downgrade  nor do they have broad material adverse change clauses that could affect access to the lines in the event of any material adverse event so long as any such event is timely disclosed 
as of december   the lines were unused

bank executive overview and strategy when asb was acquired by hei in  it was a traditional thrift with assets of billion and net income of about million 
asb has grown by both acquisition and internal growth since and ended with assets of billion and net income of million  compared to assets of billion as of december  and net income of million in excluding a million after tax charge for franchise taxes for prior years due to an adverse tax ruling  net income would have been million in see bank franchise taxes below 
the quality of asb s assets  the interest rate environment and the strategic transformation of asb have impacted and will continue to impact its financial results 
due to improved asset quality resulting from the strength in the hawaii economy and the real estate market  asb recognized a million after tax reversal of allowance for loan losses during despite a billion increase in its average balances of loans 
asb s allowance as a percentage of average loans was at the end of  compared to and at the end of and  respectively 
this ratio falls between the benchmark ratios for national banks and thrifts  which is appropriate because asb s large residential mortgage portfolio is typical of a thrift and asb has added commercial and commercial real estate loans typical of commercial banks 
the allowance is adjusted continuously through the provision for loan losses to reflect factors such as charge offs  outstanding loan balances  loan grading  external factors affecting the national and hawaii economy  specific industries and sectors and interest rates  and historical and estimated loan losses 

table of contents asb has been facing a challenging interest rate environment that has pressured its net interest margin 
the federal reserve bank s rate increases since mid have led to higher short term interest rates  while  during the same period  long term interest rates have remained low  resulting in an inverted yield curve at year end 
the higher short term interest rates have put upward pressure on deposit rates  while the low long term interest rates have held down asset yields  putting downward pressure on net interest margin 
if the current interest rate environment persists  the potential for compression of asb s margin will continue to be a concern 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  asb uses simulation analysis to measure net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
asb then employs strategies to limit the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
asb s key strategies include attracting and retaining low cost deposits  which enables asb to replace other borrowings and reduce funding costs  diversifying its loan portfolio with higher yielding  shorter maturity loans or variable rate loans such as commercial  commercial real estate and consumer loans  which also creates a more diversified income stream for the bank  investing in mortgage related securities with short average lives  and lengthening the maturities of costing liabilities in a lower interest rate environment  which has stabilized the cost of other borrowings as interest rates have risen 
asb has been undergoing a transformation  involving four major lines of business  to become a full service community bank serving both consumer and commercial customers 
two have been completed commercial real estate and mortgage banking  and a third is nearing completion commercial banking 
the remaining transformation involving retail banking is intended to make asb s retail area more customer centric  rather than product centric 
the transformation project will require continued investment in people and technology 
in addition to these transformation projects  asb will continue to invest in projects and opportunities that will build core franchise value and add to earnings growth and returns 
additionally  the banking industry is constantly changing and asb is continuously making the changes and investments necessary to adapt and remain competitive 
asb s ongoing challenge is to increase revenues faster than expenses

the following table presents a reconciliation of asb s net income to net income excluding the million charge in and including additional bank franchise taxes in prior periods as if asb had not taken a dividends received deduction on income from its reit subsidiary 
management believes the adjusted information below presents asb s net income on a more comparable basis for the periods shown

taking into account the adjustments in the table above  asb s net income would have increased compared to bank operations earnings of asb depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on costing liabilities 
as discussed above  if the current interest rate environment persists  the potential for compression of asb s net interest margin will continue to be a concern

net interest income before reversal of allowance for loan losses for increased by million  or  when compared to strong organic growth in loans and deposits and the ability to keep deposit cost low enabled asb to offset margin compression pressure from a flattening yield curve  which inverted near year end 
net interest margin increased from in to in due to growth in the loan portfolio and higher yields in the loan and mortgage related securities portfolios funded by strong deposit growth 
the increase in the average loan portfolio balance was helped by the continued strength in the hawaii economy and real estate market 
the decrease in the average investment and mortgage related securities portfolios was due to the reinvestment of excess liquidity into loans

growth in the loan portfolio and mortgage related securities were funded by strong deposit growth 
the increase in average loan portfolio balance was due to a strong hawaii real estate market and low interest rates 
the increase in the average investment and mortgage related securities portfolios was due to the reinvestment into short term investments of excess liquidity resulting from an inflow of deposits 
on january   asb became aware that the methodology it was using to amortize premiums and discounts on its mortgage related securities portfolio was not in strict conformance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
specifically  asb determined that its method for estimating the cumulative impact of revised effective yield following the provisions of paragraph of sfas no 
when considering prepayments no longer approximated the results from a strict application of these provisions 
this resulted in over amortization of net premiums

fhlb of seattle business and capital plan in december  the fhlb of seattle signed an agreement with its regulator  the federal housing finance board finance board  to adopt a business and capital plan to strengthen its risk management  capital structure and governance 
in april  the fhlb of seattle delivered a proposed three year business plan and capital management plan to the finance board  and issued a press release stating that it anticipates minimal to no dividends in the next few years while it implements its new business model 
no dividends were received by asb from the fhlb of seattle during the fourth quarter of and the last three quarters of subject to the impact of legislation being considered by congress discussed below under legislation and regulation  member access to the fhlb of seattle funding and liquidity is expected to continue unimpeded during implementation of the three year plan 

table of contents legislation and regulation congress is considering legislation to revamp oversight of government sponsored enterprises gses 
this legislation would abolish the office of federal housing enterprise oversight regulator of fannie mae and freddie mac and the federal housing finance board regulator of the fhlb  create a new regulatory agency to oversee gses  and invest in this new agency the authority  among other things  to place limitations on non mission assets  to establish prudent management and operation standards for gses concerning matters such as the management of asset and investment portfolio growth  to impose prompt corrective action measures on a gse in the event of under capitalization  and to exercise oversight enforcement powers 
by possibly restricting gse asset growth  if enacted  this legislation could potentially limit the availability of advances from the fhlb of seattle to asb and sale of loans to fannie mae 
asb believes  however  that if this legislation is adopted and implemented in these ways  its results will not be materially adversely affected because asb has access to other funding sources and secondary markets to sell its loans 
asb is subject to extensive regulation  principally by the office of thrift supervision ots and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
depending on its level of regulatory capital and other considerations  these regulations could restrict the ability of asb to compete with other institutions and to pay dividends to its shareholders 
see the discussions below under liquidity and capital resources and certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition bank 
liquidity and capital resources december change change dollars in millions assets available for sale investment and mortgage related securities investment in stock of federal home loan bank of seattle loans receivable  net deposit liabilities securities sold under agreements to repurchase advances from fhlb as of december   asb was the third largest financial institution in hawaii based on assets of billion and deposits of billion

table of contents asb believes that a satisfactory regulatory capital position provides a basis for public confidence  affords protection to depositors  helps to ensure continued access to capital markets on favorable terms and provides a foundation for growth 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that are not well capitalized to compete on the same terms as well capitalized institutions  such as by offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions

the following is a discussion of certain of these factors 
see also forward looking statements above and item a 
risk factors 
consolidated economic conditions 
because its core businesses are providing local electric utility and banking services  hei s operating results are significantly influenced by the strength of hawaii s economy  which in turn is influenced by economic conditions in the mainland us particularly california and asia particularly japan as a result of the impact of those conditions on tourism 
see economic conditions above 
competition 
the electric utility and banking industries are competitive and the company s success in meeting competition will continue to have a direct impact on the company s financial performance 
electric utility 
although competition in the generation sector in hawaii has been moderated by the scarcity of generation sites  various permitting processes and lack of interconnections to other electric utilities  heco and its subsidiaries face competition from ipps and customer self generation  with or without cogeneration 
in  the puc issued an order instituting a proceeding to identify and examine the issues surrounding electric competition and to determine the impact of competition on the electric utility infrastructure in hawaii 
in october  the puc closed the competition proceeding and opened investigative proceedings on two specific issues competitive bidding and dg to move toward a more competitive electric industry environment under cost based regulation 
competitive bidding proceeding 
the stated purpose of the competitive bidding proceeding is to evaluate competitive bidding as a mechanism for acquiring or building new generating capacity in hawaii 
the current parties participants in the competitive bidding proceeding include the consumer advocate  heco  helco  meco  kauai island utility cooperative and a renewable energy organization 
the issues to be addressed in the proceeding include the benefits and impacts of competitive bidding  whether a competitive bidding system should be developed for acquiring or building new generation  and revisions that should be made to integrated resource planning 
if it is determined that a competitive bidding system should be developed  issues include how a fair system can be developed that ensures that competitive benefits result from the system and ratepayers are not 
table of contents placed at undue risk  what the guidelines and requirements for prospective bidders should be  and how such a system can encourage broad participation 
the puc stated it would consider related matters on a case by case basis pending completion of the competitive bidding and dg proceedings 
statements of position by  information requests to  and responses by the parties participants were filed in march through august the puc held panel hearings in december the parties will engage in working sessions to discuss a competitive bidding framework and file a joint submission by march  identifying areas of agreement and disagreement for the puc s review and consideration 
after the filing of briefs  oral arguments are expected to be presented to the puc in may management cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or its effect on the ability of the electric utilities to acquire or build additional generating capacity in the future 
distributed generation proceeding 
the electric utilities have been expanding their use and consideration of dg resources to meet the energy needs of the utility systems 
utility sited dg has been deployed to provide peaking capacity and to defer the need for transmission system infrastructure 
the utilities have also been pursuing the possibility of offering utility owned  customer sited combined heat and power chp systems to large customers to produce electricity and thermal energy  which is generally used in hawaii to heat water and  through an absorption chiller  drive an air conditioning system 
the electric energy generated by these systems is usually lower in output than the customer s load  which results in the customer s continued connection to the utility grid to make up the difference in electricity demand and to provide back up electricity 
incremental generation from such customer sited chp systems and other forms of dg is intended to complement traditional central station power  as part of the electric utilities plans to meet their forecasted load growth 
in october  the puc opened the dg proceeding to determine the potential benefits and impact of dg on hawaii s electric distribution systems and markets and to develop policies and a framework for dg projects deployed in hawaii 
in april  the puc issued an order in the dg proceeding defining issues related to planning eg  who should own and operate projects and the roles of the electric utilities and puc  impacts eg  on the transmission and distribution systems  power quality and reliability  the use of fossil fuels and utility costs and implementation eg  issues concerning matters to be considered to allow a dg facility s interconnection with the utility s grid  appropriate rate design and cost allocation issues  and revisions that should be made to puc and utility rules and practices 
hearings were held in december prior to opening of the investigative dg proceeding  the electric utilities filed an application for approval of chp tariffs  under which they would own  operate and maintain customer sited  packaged chp systems and certain ancillary equipment pursuant to standard form contracts with eligible commercial customers 
this chp tariff application and a helco application for approval of an agreement with a customer for a utility chp project were suspended by the puc until  at a minimum  the matters in the dg proceeding were adequately addressed 
on january   the puc issued its d o in the dg proceeding 
in the d o the puc indicated that its policy is to promote the development of a market structure that assures dg is available at the lowest feasible cost  dg that is economical and reliable has an opportunity to come to fruition and dg that is not cost effective does not enter the system 
with regard to dg ownership  the d o affirmed the ability of the electric utilities to procure and operate dg for utility purposes at utility sites 
the puc also indicated its desire to promote the development of a competitive market for customer sited dg 
in weighing the general advantages and disadvantages of allowing a utility to provide dg services on a customer s site  the puc found that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages 
however  the puc also found that the utility is the most informed potential provider of dg and it would not be in the public interest to exclude the heco utilities from providing dg services at this early stage of dg market development 
therefore  the d o allows the utility to provide dg services on a customer owned site as a regulated service when the dg resolves a legitimate system need  the dg is the least cost alternative to meet that need  and it can be shown that  in an open and competitive process acceptable to the puc  the customer operator was unable to find another entity ready and able to supply the proposed dg service at a price and quality comparable to the utility s offering 
the d o also requires the electric utilities to establish reliability and safety requirements for dg  establish a non discriminatory dg interconnection policy  develop a standardized interconnection agreement to streamline the dg application review process  establish standby rates based on unbundled costs associated with providing each 
table of contents service ie  generation  distribution  transmission and ancillary services  and establish detailed affiliate requirements should the utility choose to sell dg through an affiliate 
on march   the electric utilities filed a motion for clarification and or partial reconsideration requesting that the puc clarify how the three conditions under which electric utilities are allowed to provide regulated dg services at customer owned sites will be administered  in order to better determine the impacts the conditions may have on the electric utilities dg plans 
bank 
the banking industry in hawaii is highly competitive 
asb is the third largest financial institution in hawaii  based on assets  and is in direct competition for deposits and loans  not only with the two larger institutions  but also with smaller institutions that are heavily promoting their services in certain niche areas  such as providing financial services to small and medium sized businesses  and national organizations offering financial services 
asb s main competitors are banks  savings associations  credit unions  mortgage brokers  finance companies and securities brokerage firms 
these competitors offer a variety of lending  deposit and investment products to retail and business customers 
the primary factors in competing for deposits are interest rates  the quality and range of services offered  marketing  convenience of locations  hours of operation and perceptions of the institution s financial soundness and safety 
to meet competition  asb offers a variety of savings and checking accounts at competitive rates  convenient business hours  convenient branch locations with interbranch deposit and withdrawal privileges at each branch and convenient automated teller machines 
asb also conducts advertising and promotional campaigns 
the primary factors in competing for first mortgage and other loans are interest rates  loan origination fees and the quality and range of lending and other services offered 
asb believes that it is able to compete for such loans primarily through the competitive interest rates and loan fees it charges  the type of mortgage loan programs it offers and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides to individual borrowers and the business community 
asb has been expanding its traditional consumer focus to be a full service community bank and has been diversifying its loan portfolio from single family home mortgages to higher yielding  shorter duration consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the origination of consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans involves risks and other considerations different from those associated with originating residential real estate loans 
for example  the sources and level of competition may be different and credit risk is generally higher than for mortgage loans 
these different risk factors are considered in the underwriting and pricing standards and in the allowance for loan losses established by asb for its consumer  commercial and commercial real estate loans 
in recent years  there has been significant bank and thrift merger activity affecting hawaii  including the merger in of the holding companies for the state s th and th largest financial institutions based on assets 
management cannot predict the impact  if any  of these mergers on the company s future competitive position  results of operations or financial condition 
us capital markets and interest rate environment 
changes in the us capital markets can have significant effects on the company 
for example volatility in us capital markets can affect the fair values of assets available to satisfy retirement benefits obligations 
the company estimates that consolidated retirement benefits expense  net of amounts capitalized and income taxes  will be million in as compared to million in  partly as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on the discount rate used to determine retirement benefit liabilities 
volatility in us capital markets may negatively impact the fair values of investment and mortgage related securities held by asb 
as of december   the fair value and carrying value of the investment and mortgage related securities held by asb were billion 
interest rate risk is a significant risk of asb s operations 
asb actively manages this risk  including managing the relationship of its interest sensitive assets to its interest sensitive liabilities 
federal government monetary policies and low interest rates have resulted in high mortgage refinancing volume in and as well as accelerated prepayments of loans and securities 
the federal reserve began increasing rates in  while longer term interest rates have not increased significantly  causing a flattening of the yield curve 
this type of interest rate environment typically puts downward pressure on asb s net interest margin 
as of december   the company had no floating rate long term debt outstanding 
as of december   consolidated hei had million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of and maturities ranging from to days 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

table of contents technological developments 
new technological developments eg  the commercial development of fuel cells or distributed generation or significant advances in internet banking may impact the company s future competitive position  results of operations and financial condition 
limited insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  the company purchases insurance coverages eg  property and liability coverages to protect itself against loss of or damage to its properties and against claims made by third parties and employees for property damage or personal injuries 
however  the protection provided by such insurance is limited in significant respects and  in some instances  the company has no coverage 
for electric utility examples  see limited insurance in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
asb also has no insurance coverage for business interruption nor credit card fraud 
certain of the company s insurance has substantial deductibles or has limits on the maximum amounts that may be recovered 
insurers also have exclusions or limitations of coverage for claims related to certain perils including  but not limited to  mold and terrorism 
if a series of losses occurred  such as from a series of lawsuits in the ordinary course of business each of which were subject to the deductible amount  or if the maximum limit of the available insurance were substantially exceeded  the company could incur losses in amounts that would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
environmental matters 
hei and its subsidiaries are subject to environmental laws and regulations that regulate the operation of existing facilities  the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances 
these laws and regulations  among other things  require that certain environmental permits be obtained as a condition to constructing or operating certain facilities 
obtaining such permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays 
also  these laws and regulations may be amended from time to time  including amendments that increase the burden and expense of compliance 
management believes that the recovery through rates of most  if not all  of any costs incurred by heco and its subsidiaries in complying with environmental requirements would be allowed by the puc 
the heco  helco and meco generating stations operate under air pollution control permits issued by the doh and  in a limited number of cases  by the epa 
the legislature passed legislation that clarifies that the accepting agency or authority for an environmental impact statement is not required to be the approving agency for the permit or approval and also requires an environmental assessment for proposed waste to energy facilities  landfills  oil refineries  power generating facilities greater than mw and wastewater facilities  except individual wastewater systems 
this legislation could result in an increase in project costs 
the entire electric utility industry has been affected by the amendments to the clean air act caa  changes to the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone  and adoption of a naaqs for fine particulate matter 
further significant impacts may occur if currently proposed legislation  rules and standards are adopted 
for discussions of the ongoing honolulu harbor environmental investigation  the july regional haze rule amendments and section b of the federal clean water act  see environmental regulation in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that a significant environmental liability will not be incurred by the electric utilities 
prior to extending a loan secured by real property  asb conducts due diligence to assess whether or not the property may present environmental risks and potential cleanup liability 
in the event of default and foreclosure of a loan  asb may become the owner of the mortgaged property 
for that reason  asb seeks to avoid lending upon the security of  or acquiring through foreclosure  any property with significant potential environmental risks  however  there can be no assurance that asb will successfully avoid all such environmental risks 
electric utility regulation of electric utility rates 
the rates the electric utilities are allowed to charge for their services  and the timeliness of permitted rate increases  are among the most important items influencing their financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the puc has broad discretion over the rates the electric utilities charge and other matters 
any adverse decision by the puc concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates  the authorized returns on equity or rate base found to be reasonable  the potential consequences of exceeding or not meeting such returns  or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding could have a material adverse 
table of contents affect on the company s and heco s consolidated results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
upon a showing of probable entitlement  the puc is required to issue an interim d o in a rate case within months from the date of filing a completed application if the evidentiary hearing is completed subject to extension for days if the evidentiary hearing is not completed 
there is no time limit for rendering a final d o 
interim rate increases are subject to refund with interest  pending the final outcome of the case 
through december   heco and its subsidiaries had recognized million of revenues with respect to interim orders regarding certain integrated resource planning costs and an oahu general rate increase  which revenues are subject to refund  with interest  if and to the extent they exceed the amounts allowed in final orders 
the consumer advocate has objected to the recovery of million before interest of the million of incremental irp costs incurred by the utilities during the period  and the puc s decision is pending on this matter 
in addition  heco and meco incurred approximately million of incremental integrated resource planning costs for  for which the consumer advocate has not yet stated its position 
see most recent rate requests heco above for a discussion of the status of the current heco rate case 
management cannot predict with certainty when the final d o in the current heco rate case or when d os in future rate cases will be rendered or the amount of any interim or final rate increase that may be granted 
further  the increasing levels of o m expenses including increased retirement benefit costs  increased capital expenditures  or other factors could result in the electric utilities seeking rate relief more often than in the past 
the rate schedules of each of the electric utilities include energy cost adjustment clauses under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
in puc decisions approving the electric utilities fuel supply contracts  the puc affirmed the electric utilities right to include in their respective energy cost adjustment clauses the stated costs incurred pursuant to their respective new fuel supply contracts  to the extent that these costs are not included in their respective base rates  and restated its intention to examine the need for continued use of energy cost adjustment clauses in rate cases 
while there was no opposition to the continuation of the clause by the parties in the pending heco rate case  there can be no assurance concerning actions the puc may take in its final order in the pending heco rate case or otherwise in the future with respect to these clauses 
in addition  the state legislature is currently considering legislation which would direct the puc to review and consider alternatives to the current energy cost adjustment clause and  at this time  it is not possible to predict the outcome of those deliberations 
until such time  the electric utilities will continue to recover their fuel contract costs through their respective energy cost adjustment clauses to the extent the costs are not recovered in their base rates 
fuel oil and purchased power 
the electric utilities rely on fuel oil suppliers and ipps to deliver fuel oil and power  respectively 
see fuel contracts and power purchase agreements ppas in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company estimates that of the net energy generated and purchased by heco and its subsidiaries in will be generated from the burning of oil 
purchased kwhs provided approximately of the total net energy generated and purchased in compared to in and in failure or delay by the electric utilities oil suppliers and shippers to provide fuel pursuant to existing supply contracts  or failure by a major independent power producer to deliver the firm capacity anticipated in its power purchase agreement  could interrupt the ability of the electric utilities to deliver electricity  thereby materially adversely affecting the company s results of operations and financial condition 
heco generally maintains an average system fuel inventory level equivalent to days of forward consumption 
helco and meco generally maintain an inventory level equivalent to one month s supply of both medium sulfur fuel oil and diesel fuel 
the electric utilities major sources of oil  through their suppliers  are in china  vietnam and the far east 
some  but not all  of the electric utilities power purchase agreements require that the ipps maintain minimum fuel inventory levels and all of the firm capacity power purchase agreements include provisions imposing substantial penalties for failure to produce the firm capacity anticipated by those agreements 

table of contents other operation and maintenance expenses 
other operation and maintenance expenses increased  and for  and  respectively  when compared to the prior year 
this trend of increased operation and maintenance expenses is expected to continue in as the electric utilities anticipate higher demand side management expenses that are passed on to customers through a surcharge and therefore do not impact net income and integrated resource planning expenses  higher employee benefits expenses  primarily for retirement benefits and higher production expenses  primarily to meet higher demand levels and load growth set in and sustained in the timing and amount of these expenses can vary as circumstances change 
for example  recent overhauls have been more expensive than in the past due to the larger scope of work necessary to maintain the aging equipment  which has experienced heavier usage as demand has increased to current levels 
until an overhaul is fully underway  it is possible that the maintenance costs for a generating unit may be significantly higher than originally planned 
increased operation and maintenance expenses were among the reasons heco filed a request with the puc in november to increase base rates 
in september  heco received interim rate relief see most recent rate requests 
other regulatory and permitting contingencies 
many public utility projects require puc approval and various permits eg  environmental and land use permits from other agencies 
delays in obtaining puc approval or permits can result in increased costs 
if a project does not proceed or if the puc disallows costs of the project  the project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
two major capital improvement utility projects  the keahole project and the east oahu transmission project  have encountered opposition and have been seriously delayed although ct and ct at keahole are now operating

bank regulation of asb 
asb is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the department of treasury  ots and the fdic  and is subject to reserve requirements established by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
regulation by these agencies focuses in large measure on the adequacy of asb s capital and the results of periodic safety and soundness examinations conducted by the ots 
asb s insurance product sales activities  including those conducted by asb s insurance agency subsidiary  bishop insurance agency of hawaii  inc  are subject to regulation by the hawaii insurance commissioner 
capital requirements 
the ots  which is asb s principal regulator  administers two sets of capital standards minimum regulatory capital requirements and prompt corrective action requirements 
the fdic also has prompt corrective action capital requirements 
as of december   asb was in compliance with ots minimum regulatory capital requirements and was well capitalized within the meaning of ots prompt corrective action regulations and fdic capital regulations  as follows asb met applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements noted in parentheses as of december  with a tangible capital ratio of  a core capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
asb met the capital requirements to be generally considered well capitalized noted in parentheses as of december  with a leverage ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
the purpose of the prompt corrective action capital requirements is to establish thresholds for varying degrees of oversight and intervention by regulators 
declines in levels of capital  depending on their severity  will result in increasingly stringent mandatory and discretionary regulatory consequences 
capital levels may decline for any number of reasons  including reductions that would result if there were losses from operations  deterioration in collateral values or the inability to dispose of real estate owned such as by foreclosure 
the regulators have substantial discretion in the corrective actions they might direct and could include restrictions on dividends and other distributions that asb may make to its shareholders and the requirement that asb develop and implement a plan to restore its capital 
under an agreement with regulators entered into by hei when it acquired asb  hei could be required to contribute to asb up to an additional million of capital  if necessary to maintain asb s capital position 

table of contents examinations 
asb is subject to periodic safety and soundness examinations and other examinations by the ots 
in conducting its examinations  the ots utilizes the uniform financial institutions rating system adopted by the federal financial institutions examination council  which system utilizes the camels criteria for rating financial institutions 
the six components in the rating system are capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk 
the ots examines and rates each camels component 
an overall camels rating is also given  after taking into account all of the component ratings 
a financial institution may be subject to formal regulatory or administrative direction or supervision such as a memorandum of understanding or a cease and desist order following an examination if its camels rating is not satisfactory 
an institution is prohibited from disclosing the ots s report of its safety and soundness examination or the component and overall camels rating to any person or organization not officially connected with the institution as an officer  director  employee  attorney  or auditor  except as provided by regulation 
the ots also regularly examines asb s information technology practices  and its performance as related to the community reinvestment act measurement criteria 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended  addresses the safety and soundness of the deposit insurance system  supervision of depository institutions and improvement of accounting standards 
pursuant to this act  federal banking agencies have promulgated regulations that affect the operations of asb and its holding companies eg  standards for safety and soundness  real estate lending  accounting and reporting  transactions with affiliates and loans to insiders 
fdic regulations restrict the ability of financial institutions that fail to meet relevant capital measures to engage in certain activities  such as offering interest rates on deposits that are significantly higher than the rates offered by competing institutions and offering pass through insurance coverage ie  insurance coverage that passes through to each owner beneficiary of the applicable deposit for the deposits of most employee benefit plans ie   per individual participant  not  per plan 
as of december   asb was well capitalized and thus not subject to these restrictions 
qualified thrift lender status 
asb is a qualified thrift lender qtl under its federal thrift charter and  in order to maintain this status  asb is required to maintain at least of its assets in qualified thrift investments  which include housing related loans including mortgage related securities as well as certain small business loans  education loans  loans made through credit card accounts and a basket not exceeding of total assets of other consumer loans and other assets 
savings associations that fail to maintain qtl status are subject to various penalties  including limitations on their activities 
in asb s case  the activities of hei  heidi and hei s other subsidiaries would also be subject to restrictions  and a failure or inability to comply with those restrictions could effectively result in the required divestiture of asb 
as of december   approximately of its assets were qualified thrift investments 
federal thrift charter 
the gramm leach bliley act of the gramm act permitted banks  insurance companies and investment firms to compete directly against each other  thereby allowing one stop shopping for an array of financial services 
although the gramm act further restricted the creation of so called unitary savings and loan holding companies ie  companies such as hei whose subsidiaries include one or more savings associations and one or more nonfinancial subsidiaries  the unitary savings and loan holding company relationship among hei  heidi and asb is grandfathered under the gramm act so that hei and its subsidiaries will be able to continue to engage in their current activities so long as asb maintains its qtl status 
under the gramm act  any proposed sale of asb would have to satisfy applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and potential acquirers of asb would most likely be limited to companies that are already qualified as  or capable of qualifying as  either a traditional savings and loan association holding company or a bank holding company  or as one of the newly authorized financial holding companies permitted under the gramm act 
material estimates and critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change include the amounts reported for investment securities  property  plant and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  contingencies and litigation  income taxes  regulatory assets and liabilities  electric utility revenues  variable interest 
table of contents entities vies  and allowance for loan losses 
management considers an accounting estimate to be material if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the assumptions selected could have a material impact on the estimate and on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
for example  in  a significant change in estimated income taxes occurred as a result of a tax appeal court decision see asb state franchise tax dispute and settlement in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management has identified the following accounting policies it believes to be the most critical to the company s financial statements that is  management believes that the policies below are both the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and currently require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management has reviewed the material estimates and critical accounting policies with the hei audit committee 
for additional discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated investment securities 
debt securities that the company intends to and has the ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity securities and reported at amortized cost 
marketable equity securities and debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
marketable equity securities and debt securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and temporary losses excluded from earnings and reported in aoci 
for securities that are not trading securities  declines in value determined to be other than temporary are included in earnings and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
the specific identification method is used in determining realized gains and losses on the sales of securities 
asb owns one investment security a federal agency obligation  private issue mortgage related securities and mortgage related securities issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  government national mortgage association gnma and federal national mortgage association fnma  all of which are classified as available for sale 
asb obtains market prices for investment and mortgage related securities from a third party financial services provider 
the prices of these securities may be influenced by factors such as market liquidity  corporate credit considerations of the underlying collateral  the levels of interest rates  expectations of prepayments and defaults  limited investor base  market sector concerns  and overall market psychology 
adverse changes in any of these factors may result in additional losses 
as of december   asb had mortgage related securities issued by fhlmc  gnma and fnma valued at billion and private issue mortgage related securities valued at billion 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are reported at cost 
self constructed electric utility plant includes engineering  supervision  and administrative and general costs  and an allowance for the cost of funds used during the construction period 
these costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to property  plant and equipment when construction is completed and the facilities are either placed in service or become useful for public utility purposes 
upon the retirement or sale of electric utility plant  no gain or loss is recognized 
the cost of the plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation 
amounts collected from customers for cost of removal expected to exceed salvage value in the future are included in regulatory liabilities 
heco and its subsidiaries evaluate the impact of applying emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  to their new ppas  ppa amendments and other arrangements they enter into 
a possible outcome of the evaluation is that an arrangement falls within the scope of eitf and results in its classification as a capital lease  which could have a material effect on heco s consolidated balance sheet  as a significant amount of capital assets and lease obligations would need to be recorded 
management believes that the puc will allow recovery of property  plant and equipment in its electric rates 
if the puc does not allow recovery of any such costs  the electric utility would be required to write off the disallowed 
table of contents costs at that time 
see the discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements concerning costs recorded for ct and ct at keahole and the east oahu transmission project 
pension and other postretirement benefits obligations

contingencies and litigation 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to environmental matters 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments in or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual case or proceeding often with the assistance of outside counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach in dealing with these matters  such as a change in settlement strategy 
in general  environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense  unless it is probable that the puc would allow such costs to be recovered in future rates  in which case such costs would be capitalized as regulatory assets 
also  environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity  or improve the safety or efficiency of property  the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination  or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale 
see environmental regulation in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the honolulu harbor investigation 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management periodically evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from tax experts 
management believes that the company s provision for tax contingencies is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect the company s current and deferred income tax amounts 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
electric utility regulatory assets and liabilities 
the electric utilities are regulated by the puc 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  the company s financial statements reflect assets  liabilities  revenues and costs of heco and its subsidiaries based on current cost based rate making regulations 
the actions of regulators can affect the timing of recognition of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
regulatory liabilities represent amounts collected from customers for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
as of december   regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets amounted to million and million  respectively 
regulatory liabilities and regulatory assets are itemized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environment 
because current rates include the recovery of regulatory assets existing as of the last rate case and rates in effect allow the utilities to earn a reasonable rate of return  management believes the regulatory assets as of 
table of contents december  are probable of recovery 
this determination assumes continuation of the current political and regulatory climate in hawaii  and is subject to change in the future 
management believes heco and its subsidiaries operations currently satisfy the sfas no 
criteria 
if events or circumstances should change so that those criteria are no longer satisfied  the electric utilities expect that the regulatory assets would be charged to income and the regulatory liabilities would be credited to income or refunded to ratepayers 
in the event of unforeseen regulatory actions or other circumstances  however  management believes that a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position may result if regulatory assets have to be charged to expense without an offsetting credit for regulatory liabilities or if regulatory liabilities are required to be refunded to ratepayers 
electric utility revenues 
electric utility revenues are based on rates authorized by the puc and include revenues applicable to energy consumed in the accounting period but not yet billed to customers 
as of december   revenues applicable to energy consumed  but not yet billed to customers  amounted to million 
revenue amounts recorded pursuant to a puc interim order are subject to refund  with interest  pending a final order 
also  the rate schedules of the electric utilities include energy cost adjustment clauses under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power  and the relative amounts of company generated power and purchased power 
see regulation of electric utility rates above 
consolidation of vies 
in december  the fasb issued revised fin no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
the company evaluates the impact of applying fin r to its relationships with ipps with whom the electric utilities execute new power purchase agreements or execute amendments of existing power purchase agreements 
a possible outcome of the analysis is that heco or its subsidiaries  as applicable may be found to meet the definition of a primary beneficiary of a vie the ipp which finding may result in the consolidation of the ipp in heco s consolidated financial statements 
the consolidation of ipps could have a material effect on heco s consolidated financial statements  including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities  and  if such a consolidated ipp were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity  the potential recognition of such losses 
the electric utilities do not know how the consolidation of ipps would be treated for regulatory or credit ratings purposes 
see general consolidation consolidation of vies in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
bank allowance for loan losses 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   asb s allowance for loan losses was million and asb had million of loans on nonaccrual status 
in  asb s reversal of allowance for loan losses was million 
although management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate  the actual loan losses  provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses may be materially different if conditions change eg  if there is a significant change in the hawaii economy  and material increases in those amounts could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial position

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hei the company manages various market risks in the ordinary course of business  including credit risk and liquidity risk 
the company believes the electric utility and other segments exposures to these two risks are not material as of december  credit risk for asb is the risk that borrowers or issuers of securities will not be able to repay their obligations to the bank 
credit risk associated with the lending portfolios is controlled through asb s underwriting standards  loan rating of commercial and commercial real estate loans  on going monitoring by loan officers  credit review and quality control functions in these lending areas and adequate allowance for loan losses 
credit risk associated with the securities portfolio is mitigated by asb s asset liability management process  experienced staff working with analytical tools  monthly fair value analysis and on going monitoring and reporting such as investment watch reports and loss sensitivity analysis 
see allowance for loan losses above 
liquidity risk for asb is the risk that the bank will not meet its obligations when they become due 
liquidity risk is mitigated by asb s asset liability management process  on going analytical analysis  monitoring and reporting information such as weekly cash flow analyses and maintenance of liquidity contingency plans 
the company is exposed to some commodity price risk primarily related to its fuel supply and ipp contracts 
the company s commodity price risk is substantially mitigated so long as the electric utilities have their current energy cost adjustment clauses in their rate schedules 
see discussion of the energy cost adjustment clauses in certain factors that may affect future results and financial condition electric utility regulation of electric utility rates 
the company currently has no hedges against its commodity price risk 
because the company does not have a large portfolio of trading assets  the company is not exposed to significant market risk from trading activities 
however  until the company sell its shares of hoku a hawaii fuel cell company that completed its initial public offering in august  fluctuations in the market price of the shares will impact the company s net income 
the company s current exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material 
the company considers interest rate risk to be a very significant market risk as it could potentially have a significant effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition  especially as it relates to asb  but also as it may affect the discount rate used to determine pension liabilities  the market value of pension plans assets and the electric utilities allowed rates of return 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of the company s earnings to adverse movements in interest rates 

table of contents bank interest rate risk the company s success is dependent  in part  upon asb s ability to manage interest rate risk 
asb s interest rate risk profile is strongly influenced by its primary business of making fixed rate residential mortgage loans and taking in retail deposits 
large mismatches in the amounts or timing between the maturity or repricing of interest sensitive assets or liabilities could adversely affect asb s earnings and the market value of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of significant changes in the level of interest rates 
many other factors also affect asb s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  and competition for loans or deposits 
asb s asset liability management committee alco  whose voting members are officers and employees of asb  is responsible for managing interest rate risk and carrying out the overall asset liability management objectives and activities of asb as approved by the asb board of directors 
alco establishes policies under which management monitors and coordinates asb s assets and liabilities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the use of rate lock commitments on loans held for sale and forward sale contracts to manage some interest rate risk associated with asb s residential loan sale program 
management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis with an emphasis on measuring changes in net interest income nii and the market value of interest sensitive assets and liabilities in different interest rate environments 
the simulation analysis is performed using a dedicated asset liability management software system enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation cmo database 
the simulation software is capable of generating scenario specific cash flows for all instruments using the specified contractual information for each instrument and product specific prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage related securities 
nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pre tax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios 
nii sensitivity is measured as the change in nii in the alternate interest rate scenarios as a percentage of the base case nii 
the base case interest rate scenario is established using the current yield curve and assumes interest rates remain constant over the next twelve months 
the alternate scenarios were created by assuming immediate and sustained parallel shocks of the yield curve in increments of basis points 
at the end of  the timing of the interest rate changes in the alternate scenarios for nii sensitivity analysis was modified from instantaneous interest rate changes to rate ramps or gradual interest changes 
while the magnitude of the interest rate changes in the alternate scenarios remains the same  the timing of the changes is gradual  and accomplished by moving the yield curve in a parallel fashion  over the next twelve month period 
this change was made because gradual rate changes more closely reflect historical patterns of interest rate movements  and are therefore more useful in measuring and managing nii sensitivity 
as of december   nii sensitivity results are shown under both instantaneous rate shocks and rate ramps 
the simulation model forecasts scenario specific principal and interest cash flows for the interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the nii is calculated for each scenario 
key balance sheet modeling assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis include the size of the balance sheet remains relatively constant over the simulation horizon and maturing assets or liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments in order to maintain the current mix of the balance sheet 
in addition  assumptions are made about the prepayment behavior of mortgage related assets  future pricing spreads for new assets and liabilities  and the speed and magnitude with which deposit rates change in response to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
asb s net portfolio value npv ratio is a measure of the economic capitalization of asb 
the npv ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value of asb to the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets 
net portfolio value represents the theoretical market value of asb s net worth and is defined as the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected cash flows from existing liabilities plus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio is calculated by asb pursuant to guidelines established by the ots in thrift bulletin a 
key assumptions used in the calculation of asb s npv ratio include the prepayment behavior of loans and investments  the possible distribution of future interest rates  future pricing spreads for assets and liabilities and the rate and balance behavior

typically  if the value of asb s assets grows relative to the value of its liabilities  the npv ratio will increase 
conversely  if the value of asb s liabilities grows relative to the value of its assets  the npv ratio will decrease 
the npv ratio is calculated in multiple scenarios 
as with the nii simulation  the base case is represented by the current yield curve 
alternate scenarios are created by assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve in increments of basis points 
the npv ratio sensitivity measure is the change from the npv ratio calculated in the base case to the npv ratio calculated in the alternate rate scenarios 
the sensitivity measure alone is not necessarily indicative of the interest rate risk of an institution  as institutions with high levels of capital may be able to support a high sensitivity measure 
this measure is evaluated in conjunction with the npv ratio calculated in each scenario 
asb s interest rate risk sensitivity measures as of december  and constitute forward looking statements and were as follows december change in nii change in nii npv ratio npv ratio sensitivity change in nii npv ratio npv ratio sensitivity gradual change instantaneous change instantaneous change change in interest rates basis points base change from base case in basis points 
not performed due to the low level of interest rates as of december  management believes that asb s interest rate risk position as of december  represents a reasonable level of risk 
under the instantaneous rate shock scenarios  the december  nii profile is slightly more sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to the nii profile on december  in the basis point scenario  nii falls relative to the base case because expectations of faster prepayments and lower reinvestment rates causes the yield on assets to decline faster than the cost of liabilities  which do not fall as much because the current low level of rates on existing liabilities limits the amount by which they can decline 
asb s base npv ratio as of december  was higher than on december   primarily as a result of changes in the composition of the balance sheet and changes in the level and shape of the yield curve 
during  asb s funding mix shifted  as higher costing wholesale borrowings were replaced with lower cost deposits 
this contributed to the increase in asb s npv ratio 
asb s npv ratio sensitivity measures as of december  were comparable to the measures as of december  the computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes on the nii sensitivity  npv ratio  and npv ratio sensitivity analyses is based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  balance changes and pricing strategies  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
to the extent market conditions and other factors vary from the assumptions used in the simulation analysis  actual results may differ materially from the simulation results 
furthermore  nii sensitivity analysis measures the change in asb s twelve month  pre tax nii in alternate interest rate scenarios  and is intended to help management identify potential exposures in asb s current balance sheet and formulate appropriate strategies for managing interest rate risk 
the simulation does not contemplate any actions that asb management might undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
further  the changes in nii vary in the twelve month simulation period and are not necessarily evenly distributed over the period 
these analyses are for analytical purposes only and do not represent management s views of future market movements  the level of future earnings  or the timing of any changes in earnings within the twelve month analysis horizon 
the actual impact of changes in interest rates on nii will depend on the magnitude and speed with which rates change  actual changes in the asb s balance sheet  and management s responses to the changes in interest rates

heco heco and its subsidiaries manage various market risks in the ordinary course of business  including credit risk and liquidity risk  but management believes their exposures to these two risks are not material as of december  heco and its subsidiaries are exposed to some commodity price risk primarily related to its fuel supply and ipp contracts 
heco and its subsidiaries commodity price risk is substantially mitigated so long as they have their current energy cost adjustment clauses in their rate schedules
