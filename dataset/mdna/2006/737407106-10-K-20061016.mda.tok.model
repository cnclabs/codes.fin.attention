item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we develop  manufacture  and market medical devices for mechanical thrombectomy in native coronary arteries and coronary bypass grafts  leg arteries and in kidney dialysis access grafts and native fistulas 
our primary product  the angiojet rheolytic thrombectomy system angiojet system uses miniaturized waterjet technology  which enables interventional cardiologists  interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons  and other specialists to remove blood clots throughout the body 
the proprietary angiojet system consists of a drive unit capital equipment  a disposable pump set that delivers pressurized saline to a catheter  and a variety of disposable catheters that are specifically designed for particular clinical indications 
the angiojet coronary catheter is a class iii medical device and is marketed in the us under an approved pma 
the angiojet av access and peripheral arterial catheters are class ii devices and are marketed in the us under cleared k submissions 
we expect us angiojet system sales to grow primarily through obtaining additional fda approved product uses  introduction of new catheter models for existing indications  introduction of angiojet system related products  more face time selling to existing accounts  peer to peer selling  and the publication of clinical performance and cost effectiveness data 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include accounts of possis medical  inc and all wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and applied our best judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
our most critical accounting policies are those described below 
application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenues associated with angiojet drive units that are maintained at customer locations are recognized  and title and risk of loss on those drive units is transferred to the customer when we receive a valid purchase order from the customer 
revenue is not recognized for angiojet drive units that are maintained at customer locations as evaluation drive units 
we do not lease angiojet drive units 
revenues associated with products that are shipped to customers from our facilities are recognized  and title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  when a valid purchase order is received and the products are received at the customer s location 
provisions for returns are recorded in the same period the related revenues are recognized 
revenue recognition for drive unit extended warranties is amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the warranty period that is generally twelve months 
allowance for returns trade receivables are reduced by an allowance for items that may be returned in the future 
the allowance requires us to make estimates at the time the account receivable is recorded concerning the likelihood of returns 
the estimate is based upon our historical product return experience  customer complaint rates  information received from our customers and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we review  on a quarterly basis  the actual returns for the previous quarter and evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for future returns 
although we believe the amount of the allowance for returns is appropriate  actual returns incurred could differ from our original estimate  requiring adjustments to the allowance 
allowance for doubtful accounts substantially all of our trade receivables are due from health care facilities located in the united states 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the age of the outstanding receivables and the payment history and creditworthiness of each customer 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
although we believe the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate  nonpayment of accounts could differ from our original estimate  requiring adjustments to the allowance 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in order to determine the market value of inventory  on a quarterly basis  we assess the inventory quantities on hand to estimate future usage and sales and  if necessary  set up an obsolescence reserve for inventory deemed excess or obsolete to estimate market value 
although we believe the amount of the reserve for inventory obsolescence is appropriate  the amount of our inventory that becomes obsolete may differ from our original estimate  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
warranty reserve we provide a one year limited warranty on our angiojet system drive unit and a limited warranty on angiojet system disposable products 
we establish a warranty reserve at the time products are sold that is based upon historical frequency of claims relating to our products and the cost to replace disposable products and to repair drive units under warranty 
we evaluate the adequacy of the warranty reserve on a quarterly basis 
although we believe the amount of the warranty reserve is appropriate  given our historical experience  if actual claims incurred differ from the original estimate  we would be required to adjust the reserve 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record deferred tax assets primarily from federal and state net operating loss carryovers and from research and development tax credit carryovers and to the extent the utilization of those loss carryovers and credits is doubtful  we record an allowance against the deferred tax assets 
generally  during periods of sustained profitability no allowance is recorded unless there is a specific credit that cannot be applied before it expires  or a loss in a jurisdiction that cannot be applied in other jurisdictions 
we became profitable starting in fiscal and have remained profitable since 
in fiscal  we increased the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset to  because of research and development tax credits that may exceed the limits imposed by federal and state tax jurisdictions on use of credits and that may therefore not be realizable in future years 
stock based compensation on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based compensation  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings 
on august  we adopted sfas no 
r  and elected the modified prospective transition method 
this method permits us to apply the new requirements on a prospective basis 
our net income for fiscal  reflected stock based compensation expense of   after tax  or per diluted share 
below is a table showing the effects on sfas r on our fiscal statement of income and comparing it to fiscal and statements of income 
the following table compares our statement of income and comprehensive income as reported in accordance with gaap with a pro forma  non gaap statement of income and comprehensive income for fiscal that eliminates the effect of sfas r on the statement of income and comprehensive income 
as reported amounts include stock compensation as reported under sfas prior to revision 
in addition  fiscal and fiscal is included for comparison purposes

non gaap general accepted accounting principles disclosures in our selected financial data  management s discussion and analysis  and notes to consolidated financial statements  we make reference to non gaap general accepted accounting principles financial measures income per common share before income taxes we believe that this non gaap financial measure is useful to investors because of the complexity of the application of accounting for tax assets and credits and the effect on our net income of the allowance against the deferred tax allowance and the recovery of that allowance 
income per share before taxes  presented in conjunction with the gaap income per share  allows investors to consider operating performance independent of these complexities 
it is especially useful for fiscal and  when we had an unusual tax benefit due to the reduction of the tax valuation allowance 
sfas r various line items in our income statement  including net income before taxes  net income after tax  net income per share  cost of medical products  operating expenses including selling  general and administrative  and research and development  and provision for income taxes  without adjustment for compensation charges resulting from sfas r 
these measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative for  generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non gaap measures used by other companies 
possis believes that the presentation of non gaap net income  non gaap net income per share data  and other non gaap line items from the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income  when shown in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures  provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations 
possis further believes that where the adjustments used in calculating non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share are based on specific identified charges that impact different line items in the statements of income including cost of medical products  selling  general and administrative and research and development expense  that it is useful to investors to know how these specific line items in the statements of income are affected by these adjustments 
in particular  as possis begins to apply sfas r  it believes that it is useful to investors to understand how the expenses associated with the application of sfas r are reflected in its consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

revenue us product sales for fiscal decreased  or  to  compared to  in fiscal us product sales for fiscal decreased  or  to  compared to  in fiscal the main factor in the revenue decrease during fiscal and is the negative impact from the results of the aimi post marketing study impacting our coronary  or long catheter sales 
fiscal was also effected by higher than normal sales force turnover 
as of july   we had a total of  domestic angiojet system drive units in the field  compared to  and  at the end of the previous two fiscal years 
during fiscal  we sold approximately  catheters and pump sets versus approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal this represents a percent decrease in fiscal and an percent decrease in fiscal in unit catheter sales from the previous years 
we sold angiojet system drive units in fiscal  drive units in fiscal and drive units in fiscal although the angiojet system drive unit sales resulted from continuing customer acceptance of our coronary and peripheral catheter product lines  they also reflect the negative effects of the aimi study on coronary cath lab purchases 
we employ a variety of flexible drive unit sale programs  including outright sale and various evaluation programs 
the purchasing cycle for the angiojet system drive unit varies depending on the customer s budget cycle and is normally approximately six months from the beginning of the marketing cycle 
we have signed contracts with eight purchasing groups to increase market penetration 
these purchasing groups evaluate and screen new medical technologies  and negotiate pre determined discounts on behalf of their members  and 
by working with these purchasing groups  we are placed on their recommended vendor list  and in some instances receive marketing support from the purchasing group supported by a marketing fee that we pay 
these discounts and marketing fees have been offset by the increase in our sales to the member hospitals of the purchasing group 
there has been no material negative effect on our margins due to these discounts and marketing fees 
the discounts reduce gross revenue on the income statement  while marketing fees are included in selling  general and administrative expense on the income statement 
foreign sales of the angiojet system were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in sales is primarily due to the introduction of the spiroflex  xmi rx  xmi and xvg catheters and the increase in drive unit sales in the european market 
limited foreign sales are primarily due to cost constraints in overseas markets 
cost of medical products cost of medical products increased  to  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher production overhead on lower units produced combined with an increase in compensation charges under sfas r of  offset by the reduction in angiojet unit sales 
cost of medical products decreased  to  in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to reduction in revenue offset by higher production overhead costs 
gross profit decreased by  to  or percent of product sales  in fiscal from  or percent of product sales in fiscal gross profit decreased  in fiscal from  or percent of product sales in fiscal the decrease in the gross profit margin in fiscal and was primarily due to lower revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense increased  to  or percent of product sales  in fiscal from  or percent of product sales in fiscal the primary factors for the expense increase for fiscal was sfas r stock based compensation charges which contributed  or over half of the overall increase 
we also had increased expenditures in fiscal  however  in marketing  clinical study  and in the proportionate amount of salary  incentives and benefits for field sales personnel resulting from turnover 
selling  general and administrative expense increased  to  or percent of product sales  in fiscal compared to  or percent of product sales in fiscal the primary factors for the expense increase in fiscal were the additional expenses associated with the growth in the sales force  increased employee medical benefit costs  increase in sarbanes oxley related professional fees  increase in executive benefit plan expenses  increase in depreciation  increase in software expenses  and an increase in building rent and operating costs 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in expenses associated with marketing clinical trials  a reduction of incentives  a decrease in sales materials and sales demos  a decrease in outside services and a decrease in contract labor 
we currently have a us sales force of approximately eighty employees and expect that will be sufficient to grow sales and service our current customer base for the angiojet system through fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses increased  to  or percent of product sales  in fiscal compared to  or percent of product sales in fiscal the increase was primarily due to sfas r impact of  overall research and development expenses would have decreased by  excluding the impact of sfas r 
the level of research and development is dependent on the timing of expenses incurred for various research and development projects including the new drive unit  an associated project to combine the pump and catheter  spiroflex and spiroflex vg catheters and the guarddog distal occlusion guidewires 
research and development expenses increased  to  or percent of product sales  in fiscal compared to  or percent of product sales in fiscal the increase was largely due to the timing of expenses incurred for various research and development projects including the new drive unit  an associated project to combine the pump and catheter  dvx peripheral catheter  and projects relating to the improvement of the rapid exchange catheter and the distal occlusion guidewires 
we believe that research and development expenses for angiojet system applications and related products will decrease in fiscal over fiscal levels 
research and development expense levels are dependent upon the continuing development of its current products and investment in the development of new angiojet system thrombectomy applications and related products including clinical trials to support regulatory filings 
interest income interest income increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  and increased  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increases are due to the investing of excess cash and cash equivalents in an enhanced cash management portfolio of marketable securities and to the recent interest rate increases 
we expect interest income to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to positive operating cash flows 
loss on sale of securities loss on sales of securities was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in the losses were due to interest rate increases that reduced the fair market value of the investments in marketable securities 
future gains and losses on the sale of securities is primarily dependent on interest rate fluctuations 
provision for income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  or approximately percent of income before income taxes  for fiscal we recorded a provision for income taxes of  and  or approximately percent and percent of income before income taxes  for fiscal and  respectively 
for fiscal our effective tax rate was percent on a gaap basis and percent as adjusted to exclude the impact of sfas r 
the increase in the gaap effective tax rate in the current year is attributable to the treatment of incentive stock options or iso s under sfas r 
unless there is a disqualifying disposition  we are not entitled to a deduction upon exercise of an iso and although sfas r now requires us to recognize expense over the vesting period  there is no offsetting tax benefit 
in contrast  we are entitled to a deduction  and tax benefit  upon exercise of non qualified stock options 
approximately percent of our outstanding options at this time are iso s so the impact is significant 
during fiscal  we determined that the scope of our operations caused us to have nexus in states in which we had not previously filed corporate state income tax returns 
we filed the appropriate corporate state income tax returns in these states  including returns for prior years  to obtain the appropriate net operating loss carry forwards 
we expensed an additional  of corporate state income tax expense relating to the filing of these state corporate income tax returns during fiscal we increased our deferred tax asset by an additional  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  as a result of the tax benefit from exercise of disqualified stock options that are recorded directly in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity 
in fiscal  we performed a study of our research and development tax credit for the fiscal years through this analysis resulted in a net increase in the company s net research and development tax credits that can be carried forward of  the valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset was increased by  in fiscal to  of this allowance   relates to research and development tax credits that may not be realizable 
an additional  valuation allowance was established in fiscal that relates to the capital loss carryover 
effects of inflation inflation and changes in prices had very little effect on our net revenue and net income from operations for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately  at july  compared to  at july  the primary factor in the increase was cash provided by operations of  which was partially offset by the repurchase of company s stock for  and capital expenditures of  during fiscal  we generated  of cash from operating activities  which resulted primarily from  net income  depreciation of  a decrease in deferred tax assets of  stock based compensation expense of  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  these cash sources were partially offset by increases in inventories of  and in prepaid expenses and other assets of  depreciation includes company owned drive units at customer locations  as well as property and equipment 
the decrease in the deferred tax asset was due to the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards to offset current taxes payable 
the stock based compensation includes the expensing of stock options under sfas r 
the increase in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to the timing of the payments  including an increase in accrued compensation which was paid subsequent to year end 
inventory increased due to the introduction of new products in fiscal the increase in prepaid expenses is primarily due to increase in deposits with inventory vendors 
we used  in investing activities in fiscal this includes the net purchase of marketable securities of  and the purchase of  of property and equipment 
we used  of cash in financing activities in fiscal  which resulted from the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for  offset partially by the cash received in connection with the exercise of stock options for  during fiscal  we generated  of cash from operating activities  which resulted primarily from  net income  depreciation of  a decrease in deferred tax assets of  and a decrease in accounts receivable of  these sources of cash from operations were partially offset by cash used to fund an increase in inventories of  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  depreciation includes company owned drive units at customer locations  as well as property and equipment 
the decrease in the deferred tax asset was due to the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards to offset current taxes payable 
the  decrease in receivables was due to decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal inventory increased as we built additional units to meet the anticipated increase in demand of the angiojet system that was not realized because of the negative impact of the aimi post marketing study results 
the decrease in trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to the timing of the payments 
we used  of cash in investing activities during fiscal this includes proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of  and the purchase of  of property and equipment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we primarily invest our excess cash in a professionally managed  institutional fixed income portfolio of short duration 
the market risk on a diversified portfolio of relatively short duration is minimal  while enhancing returns above money market levels

our foreign product sales are in us dollars usd except for product sales in germany  which are in euro s 
the german product sales were minimal during fiscal we have a foreign bank account in which the german product sales receipts are deposited and immediately transferred to the operating bank account in the united states 
the balance in the german bank account was zero as of july
