item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this form k 
overview third wave technologies  inc is a leading molecular diagnostics company 
we believe our proprietary invader chemistry  a novel  molecular chemistry  is easier to use  cost effective  and enables higher testing throughput 
these and other advantages conferred by our chemistry are enabling us to provide clinicians and researchers with superior molecular solutions 
more than clinical laboratory customers are using third wave s molecular diagnostic reagents 
other customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic research centers and major health care providers 
third wave has received clearance from the us food and drug administration for its invader ugta molecular assay 
the invader ugta molecular assay is cleared for use to identify patients who may be at increased risk of adverse reaction to the chemotherapy drug camptosar irinotecan by detecting and identifying specific mutations in the ugta gene that have been associated with that risk 
camptosar  marketed in the united states by pfizer  inc  is used to treat colorectal cancer and was relabeled recently to include dosing recommendations based on a patient s genetic profile 
the company also markets a growing number of products  including analyte specific reagents asrs 
these asrs allow certified clinical reference laboratories to create assays to perform hepatitis c virus genotyping  inherited disorders testing eg  factor v leiden  and a host of other mutations associated with genetic predispositions and other diseases 
the company has developed or plans to develop a menu of molecular diagnostic products for clinical applications that include genetic testing  pharmacogenetics  and women s health 
the company also has a number of other invader products including those for research  agricultural and other applications 
our financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in the demand for our products  timing of new product introductions and deliveries made during the quarter  the timing of research  development and grant revenues  and increases in spending  including expenses related to our product development submissions for fda clearances or approvals and intellectual property litigation 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories  equipment and leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery which is generally when the title passes to the customer  provided that the company has completed all performance obligations and the customer has accepted the products 
customers have no contractual rights of return or refunds associated with product sales 
consideration received in multiple element arrangements is allocated to the separate units based upon their relative fair values 
grant and development revenues consist primarily of research grants from agencies of the federal government and revenue from companies with which the company has established strategic alliances  the revenue from which is recognized as research is performed 
payments received which are related to future performance are deferred and recorded as revenue when earned 
grant payments designated to purchase specific assets to be used in the performance of a contract are recognized as revenue over the shorter of the useful life of the asset acquired or the contract 
license and royalty revenue includes amounts earned from third parties for licenses of the company s intellectual property and are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements 
license revenues are generally recognized upon receipt unless the company has continuing performance obligations  in which case the license revenue is recognized ratably over the period of expected performance 
restructuring and other charges the restructuring and other charges resulting from the restructuring plan in the third quarter of was recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges  and financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the restructuring charge was comprised primarily of costs to consolidate facilities  impairment charges for abandoned leasehold improvements and equipment to be sold or abandoned  prepayment penalties related mainly to capital lease obligations on equipment to be sold or abandoned  and other costs related to the restructuring 
in calculating the cost to consolidate the facilities  we estimated the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the leases are terminated and the amount  if any  of sublease receipts for each location 
this required us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site 
to form our estimates for these costs  we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
estimates were also used in our calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that was held for sale 
these estimates were formed based on recent history of sales of similar equipment and market conditions 
our assumptions on the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  and the offsetting sublease receipts may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 

table of contents long lived assets impairment equipment  leasehold improvements and amortizable identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
for assets held and used  if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset or group of assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets 
for assets removed from service and held for sale  we estimate the fair market value of such assets and record an adjustment if fair value less costs to sell is lower than carrying value 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the annual impairment test was completed in the quarters ended september    and derivative instruments we sell products in a number of countries throughout the world 
during  and  we sold certain products with the resulting accounts receivable denominated in japanese yen 
prior to  we purchased foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with collections of receivables denominated in foreign currencies in the normal course of business 
these derivative instruments had maturities of less than one year and were intended to offset the effect of transaction gains and losses 
there were no contracts outstanding at december  or december  contracts outstanding at december  represented a combined us dollar equivalent commitment of approximately million 
the changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the loss or gain on the hedged asset relating to the risk being hedged are recorded currently in earnings 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because of process improvements or technology advancements  the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future need  or estimates of shelf lives may change 
we currently consider all inventory that we expect will have no activity within one year as well as any additional specifically identified inventory to be subject to a provision for excess inventory 
we also provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as changing manufacturing processes and technologies 
at december   our inventory reserves were  or of our million total gross inventories 
stock based compensation expense we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options when granted 
on january  we adopted sfas no 
r as a result of which in future periods we will recognize expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their fair values 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall cash position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged and  due to their short term nature  are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
due to the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any negative impact on the realized value of our investment portfolio 
to reduce foreign exchange risk  we selectively use financial instruments 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets 
from time to time we may purchase forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against the effects of such fluctuations 
at december   we did not hold any forward foreign exchange contracts 
our policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for profit 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in the notes to the financial statements
