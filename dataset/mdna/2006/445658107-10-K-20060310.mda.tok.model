item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of items  uncertainties  assumptions and risks associated with these statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following workers compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers compensation  vehicular collisions  and accidents and cargo claims 
most insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured 
the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates 
during  we were self insured for essentially million of our claims for personal injury and property damage and million for workers compensation claims 
effective january   the self insured portion of our claims exposure for personal injury  property damage and workers compensation was reduced to  our claims accrual policy for all self insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as legal  economic and regulatory factors 
our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim 
the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature  timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available 
accordingly  we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability 
this process involves the use of loss development factors based on our historical claims experience 
in doing so  the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
we do not discount our estimated losses 
at december   we had an accrual of approximately million for estimated net claims 
in addition  we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums 
at december   we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately million  which represented pre funded claims and premiums 
we are also substantially self insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors  trailers and containers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements 
in addition  we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short term rental arrangements 
revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade in value 
we had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at december  we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or trade in values for certain new equipment 
we have utilized these trade in values as well as other operational information  such as anticipated annual miles  in accounting for depreciation expense 
if our tractor supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for trade in values  it could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
we have not identified any impairments to our existing assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported 
accordingly  a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 
year in review our financial results for calendar year represented the fourth consecutive year of record revenues and earnings driven by good to excellent performance from each of our segments 
our net earnings of million  or per diluted share  were up over the million  or 
per diluted share  earned in fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the transportation industry during our fuel cost per gallon averaged above levels 
however  due to our fuel surcharge programs and the support and understanding of our customers  we were able to recover the majority of our higher fuel costs 
freight demand during the first half of was not as strong as the comparable period of  but volume levels improved during the last half of our dcs and jbt segments contributed most significantly to our higher level of profitability in while increases in the size of the dcs and jbt tractor fleets accounted for a portion of the increases in operating income  our continued focus on capacity management and revenue per tractor was the primary factor driving improved net earnings 
capacity management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight and individual dedicated arrangements to determine whether business that is generating low or negative margins can be replaced by different business with better margins 
we also continually analyze our business to ensure we are charging a fair price for all services that we provide 
primarily due to our capacity management actions and rate increases which offset non fuel cost increases  our revenue per tractor excluding fuel surcharges increased and in our dcs and jbt segments  respectively 
our jbi segment revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  also increased in while these rate increases were the best our intermodal segment has experienced in several years  we did start to incur higher railroad purchased transportation expense 
our jbi operating income was clearly reduced by the bni arbitration charge 
the third quarter arbitration charge of million included million that related to freight movements 
we also incurred significant legal fees in and associated with this arbitration process 
excluding the effects of the million arbitration charge that related to freight movements  our jbi segment would have reported an increase in operating income  compared with the decrease of 
we continued our focus on safety during although our actual insurance and safety costs were slightly higher than  we were able to duplicate the fine performance we saw in in terms of dot accidents per million miles and dot preventable accidents per million miles 
one significant result of our industry leading safety results over the past several years was the establishment of a multi year  deductible limit in our primary casualty and workers compensation insurance coverage 
this new deductible limit was effective january   and compares with million for casualty and million for workers compensation in our consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was  compared with in and in the current year was the second consecutive time in over years that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 
we re initiated paying a quarterly cash dividend of 
in early and increased our dividend to 
in december and to 
in december we also announced plans in december to repurchase up to million of our common stock and announced an additional million repurchase program in april results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of percentage change operating revenues between years vs 
vs 
operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits rents and purchased transportation fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses general and administrative expenses  net of gains communication and utilities arbitration settlement total operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense equity in loss of associated company earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings compared with consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues rose to billion in  a increase over we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance and revenue growth requires that fuel surcharge fsc revenue  which can fluctuate significantly between reporting periods  be excluded when making revenue comparisons 
significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of million in  compared with million in this fsc revenue impacted our year to year comparison 
if fsc revenues were excluded from both years  the increase of revenue over was 
this increased level of revenue  excluding fsc  was primarily a result of rate increases  our capacity management actions and a small increase in the size of our tractor fleet 
jbt segment revenue per loaded mile excluding fsc in averaged higher than  while dcs s revenue per tractor excluding fsc rose in over a nearly increase in jbi load volume also contributed to our higher levels of revenue 
consolidated operating expenses our total consolidated operating expenses increased over the combination of the increase in revenue over and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our operating ratio increasing slightly to from in the total cost of salaries  wages and employee benefits increased in over  primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation 
rents and purchased transportation costs rose in  primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies  related to jbi growth 
fuel and fuel taxes expense was up in  primarily due to higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to recognize and adjust revenue charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change 
it is difficult to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel tax expense or the change of fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads  dray carriers and other third parties 
these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 
while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases  partly due to empty miles run and engine idling time  we were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was partly a result of higher new tractor purchase prices and an approximately increase in the size of our company owned tractor fleet 
operating supplies and expenses rose in  partly a result of higher trailing equipment maintenance  tires and tolls costs 
a number of states have recently raised their rates for highway and bridge tolls 
the significant increase in general and administrative expenses reflects higher driver recruiting and testing costs  legal and professional fees related to our arbitration proceeding  and charitable contributions 
in october  we announced a gift to the university of arkansas that represented approximately million 
also included in the general and administrative expense category  we recognized a million net gain on the disposition of assets in  compared with a million gain in the arbitration settlement expense incurred during was due to the arbitration decision that was discussed earlier 
we accrued approximately million of interest expense during related to an irs contingency 
our effective income tax rate was in and in income tax expense in  included a contingent tax liability of million  including accrued interest  related to the irs s challenge of certain sale and leaseback transactions that closed in we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate for calendar year the equity in loss of associated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 
segments we operated three business segments during calendar year the operation of each of these businesses is described in footnote the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment

if the amount of fsc revenue were excluded from both years  jbt revenue rose over the average tractor count in was essentially the same as however  revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  was above this higher level of revenue per loaded mile was offset by approximately lower tractor utilization 
current year revenue growth was also up due to additional outsourced freight activity 
operating income of our jbt segment climbed to million in  from million in the significant increase in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  accounted for the majority of this operating income improvement 
jbi segment jbi segment revenue grew by  to billion in  from billion in if fsc revenue were excluded from both years  segment revenue increased over a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a increase in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc 
in addition  load volume increased over the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix 
operating income in our jbi segment declined to million in  from million in as previously described  a million arbitration settlement paid to bni during the third quarter of reduced jbi operating income 
in addition  this settlement also resulted in higher rail purchased transportation expense effective october  these costs more than offset the impact of higher rates and volume in the segment 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew to million in  from million in the increase in fuel surcharge revenue in significantly impacted this comparison 
if we exclude fuel surcharge revenue from both years  dcs segment revenue rose over this increase in revenue resulted from a combination of a increase in the average tractor count and a increase in net revenue per tractor  excluding fsc 
these increases were partly offset by a decline in revenue related to freight delivered by third party carriers 
the majority of these movements were billed by us to the customer in in  a larger portion of these movements were billed directly to our customer by the third party carrier 
operating income rose to million in  compared with million in similar to  we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts  identifying opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets 
financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure helped ensure that new business during generated appropriate financial returns 
we also remained focused on cost controls and raised rates when appropriate 
these efforts have improved our dcs segment operating ratio to in from in compared with overview of our consolidated net earnings for calendar year totaled a record million 
this compares with our previous record net earnings of million in diluted earnings per share were 
in  also a record number  compared with 
in the average number of diluted shares outstanding in was approximately higher than the comparable number in consolidated operating revenues were billion in  an increase of over the billion in each of our business segments contributed to our improved financial results in while the overall economy and level of freight activity were not particularly strong during  a number of factors contributed to our improved level of earnings 
we continued our focus on capacity management  as well as individual load and lane profitability 
a number of new proprietary technology tools and increased management focus allowed us to reduce the amount of unprofitable lanes and freight and to properly charge for equipment and services provided to customers 
in addition  the levels of available capacity in the industry were reduced by significant increases in insurance  fuel  equipment and driver compensation costs 
the availability of qualified drivers also limited carriers ability to expand the size of their fleets 
jbt segment jbt segment revenue was million in  up over the million in higher fsc revenue in impacted this comparison 
if the amount of fsc revenue were excluded from both years  jbt segment revenue rose over the average tractor count in declined from however  revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  was above  offsetting the decrease in the tractor fleet and enhancing operating income 
revenue growth was also up approximately from outsourced freight activity 
operating income of the jbt segment rose to million in  from million in the significant increase in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  accounted for the majority of this operating income improvement 
in addition  lower jbt accident and workers compensation costs positively impacted operating income 
jbi segment jbi segment revenue grew by  to billion in  from million in higher fsc revenue in impacted this comparison 
if fsc revenue were excluded from both years  jbi segment revenue increased over a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a increase in loads 
revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  was above levels 
the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of freight mix changes 
operating income in the jbi segment increased to million in from million in the increase in jbi operating income levels was partly a result of the higher revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  increased load volume and lower revenue equipment ownership costs  partly offset by higher rail and dray purchased transportation expenses 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew over to million in  from million in the higher level of fsc revenue in impacted this comparison 
if fsc revenue were excluded from both years  dcs segment revenue rose over the average number of trucks in the dedicated fleet increased nearly in the additional revenue growth in was primarily a result of a increase in net revenue per tractor 
operating income increased to million in versus million in during  we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets 
we also implemented cost controls and raised rates as appropriate 
these efforts improved our dcs segment operating ratio to in from in consolidated operating expenses total operating expenses increased in over  while operating revenues increased 
the combination of the change in these two categories resulted in our operating ratio improving by basis points to in  from in as previously mentioned  increases in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  and lower casualty and workers compensation claims costs were two of the more significant factors driving these changes 
we also increased the number of ics in our jbt and dcs fleets to  at december   from at the end of when we replace company operated tractors and driver employees with ics  certain costs such as salaries  wages  employee benefits and fuel are reduced and other costs such as purchased transportation increase 
the expense category of salaries  wages and employee benefits declined to of revenue in from in and the total expense dollars only increased from  compared with the increase in revenue 
while we did increase compensation levels for many of our drivers in  these increases were partly offset by lower workers compensation costs 
the number of company drivers at december   was approximately equal to the number at the end of the increase in rents and purchased transportation was primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies  related to jbi business growth  and to the continued expansion of our ic fleets 
fuel cost per gallon was approximately higher in over this increase in fuel costs and slightly lower fuel efficiency accounted for the increase in fuel costs 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to adjust charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change 
if fuel costs change rapidly  we may experience some financial impact from timing differences between financial reporting periods 
we were able to recover substantially all of our increased fuel costs experienced in calendar year we have no contract or derivative programs in place to hedge changes in fuel costs 
the decline in insurance and claims expense was primarily due to lower accident and claims experience in as mentioned above  we have continued to focus on safety throughout our entire organization 
the category of general and administrative expenses includes driver recruiting and testing  legal and professional fees  and bad debt expense 
gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions are also classified in the general and administrative category 
we experienced a net gain of approximately  on revenue equipment and other dispositions in  compared with a million loss in our net interest expense declined to million in from million in we continued to reduce our debt and capitalized lease obligations during and paid off all our remaining balance sheet debt and capital leases as of december  our continued improvement in net earnings and strong cash flow allowed us to pay off this debt 
our effective income tax rate was in  compared with in income tax expense in reflects a contingent tax liability of million  including accrued interest expense  related to certain sale and leaseback transactions that closed in income tax expense in reflected the reversal of million of non cash tax benefits taken in early related to these sale and leaseback transactions 
see risk factors for additional information on this matter 
our and income tax rates are also higher than statutory federal and state rates  primarily due to our driver per diem plan 
this plan generates net benefits to most of our eligible drivers and to the company 
however  it does result in an increase in our effective income tax rates 
the equity in loss of associated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results for transplace  inc tpi 
effective january   we increased our interest in tpi to approximately  from in jbht s financial exposure is limited to its approximate million investment in tpi since we have not made any additional commitments or guaranteed any of tpi s financial obligations 
liquidity and capital resources we generate significant amounts of cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in our continued improvement in net earnings from to has enhanced net cash from operations 
the decline in cash provided by operating activities was partly due to larger federal income tax payments and an increase in accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities in was reduced relative to by the change in deferred income taxes  which in turn  was a result of reduced tax depreciation expense 
the use of cash for trade accounts payable was partly due to timing differences of payments for insurance premiums 
cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment 
the higher level of cash used in investing activities during was a result of delayed tractor purchases in early  while we were testing the new epa compliant engines  and our decision in late to commence purchasing tractors that were under capital lease arrangements 
we paid million in to purchase tractors that were previously under capital lease programs 
at december   we had no revenue equipment on capital leases 
net cash used in financing activities during reflects the repurchase of million of our common stock 
we utilized cash to pay down debt and to purchase revenue equipment off capital leases in and we borrowed million during  primarily to fund stock repurchases and the payment of dividends 
selected balance sheet data as of december working capital ratio current maturities of long term debt and lease obligations millions total debt and capitalized lease obligations millions total debt to equity total debt as a percentage of total capital from time to time  our board of directors authorizes the repurchase of our common stock 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during the years through as previously mentioned  the board  in december  authorized the purchase of up to million of our common stock during the next year 
we commenced repurchases of our common stock in january on april   our board authorized the purchase of an additional million of our common stock over the next five years 
liquidity our need for capital typically has resulted from the acquisition of revenue equipment required to support our growth and the replacement of older revenue equipment with new  late model equipment 
we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions 
we have  during the past few years  obtained capital through a secondary common stock offering  revolving lines of credit and cash generated from operations 
we have also periodically utilized capital and operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 
since late  we have been acquiring tractors and trailing equipment primarily under purchase and operating lease arrangements  and we anticipate purchasing our revenue equipment in the foreseeable future 
we are currently committed to spend approximately million  net of expected proceeds from sale or trade in allowances  on revenue equipment and acquisition of new facilities and property in we are authorized to borrow up to million under our current revolving line of credit  which expires in april at december   we had a million balance outstanding under that agreement 
while we do anticipate some need to borrow additional amounts on our revolver during  we believe that our liquid assets  cash generated from operations and revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our revolving line of credit does not contain ratings triggers that would accelerate payments or amounts due under the agreement 
we have spent approximately million on stock repurchases during calendar year we have authorization to spend an additional million to repurchase our common stock through off balance sheet arrangements we have no capitalized lease arrangements at december  our only off balance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and facilities 
as of december   we had approximately  trailers and  containers chassis that were subject to operating leases  and we had approximately million of obligations remaining under these leases

r  share based payments 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas no 
r eliminated the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize in their financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  such as stock options  based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the cost will be based on the fair value at the grant date of the award and will be recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the adoption of sfas no 
r requires us to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of outstanding share based payments 
this expense must be based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
it will also require the benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on january  upon adoption  we will use the modified prospective method and therefore will not restate our prior period results 
sfas no 
r will apply to new share based awards and to unvested stock options outstanding on the effective date 
based on our current understanding of sfas no 
r  we believe this new accounting standard will reduce our calendar year net earnings by between three and four cents per share 
while this estimate represents the financial impact of shared based payments outstanding at december   we are unable to predict the impact of any share based payments granted subsequent to december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had million of debt outstanding at december   under our revolving line of credit 
the interest rate applicable to this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor 
our earnings would be affected by changes in these short term interest rates 
risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near term adverse increase in short term interest rates 
at our current level of borrowing  a one percent increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by million 
we have no interest rate derivatives in place at december   to mitigate this risk 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
