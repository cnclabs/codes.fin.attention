management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company rtw  inc rtw provides disability and absence management services  directed today primarily at workers compensation to i employers insured through our wholly owned insurance subsidiary  american compensation insurance company acic and its wholly owned insurance subsidiary  bloomington compensation insurance company bcic  ii self insured employers on a fee for service basis  iii state sponsored assigned risk plans on a percent of premium basis  iv other insurance companies  and v to agents and employers on a consulting basis  charging hourly fees through rtw and its absentia sm division 
acic offers guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance to employers located primarily in minnesota  michigan and colorado and is licensed in twenty three states 
bcic began underwriting business in october and offers guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance to selected employers only in minnesota 
collectively  we  our and us refer to rtw  acic  bcic and absentia in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we developed two proprietary systems to manage disability i id  designed to quickly identify early those injured employees who are likely to become inappropriately dependent on disability system benefits  and ii the rtw solution  rapid intervention in and intensive management of potentially high cost injuries  designed to lower employers disability costs and improve productivity by returning injured employees to work as soon as safely possible 
we support these proprietary management systems with state of the art technology and talented employees dedicated to our vision of transforming people from absent or idle to present and productive 
our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in minnesota and operated primarily in minnesota  michigan and colorado in  and absentia serviced customers in six states in and expanded to states by december  on april   am best co 
best affirmed the financial strength rating of b very good  secure for acic and revised its outlook to positive from stable 
the rating reflects our improved capitalization and profitability over the last three years 
acic increased its statutory capital and surplus to million at december  and million at december  from million at december  as a result of profitability in and we believe that our b rating from am best may create a barrier in certain circumstances for us as there are agents and employers that will only do business with insurers rated a or better

we expect to grow premiums in force opportunistically as we expand to areas outside our traditional markets 
we also anticipate that premium rates will decrease slightly in as the markets in which we operate continue to become more competitive 
we will focus on insurance profitability by i writing new business in niches that are less sensitive to soft market pricing  ii aggressively managing and closing claims  
table of contents iii reviewing policy profitability at renewal and removing unprofitable accounts  and iv aggressively managing policy acquisition costs 
we expect to increase non insurance revenue significantly in as we continue to provide services to employers insured through the minnesota assigned risk plan and add new customers 
general and administrative expenses will increase as we i continue to hire and position for the future  and ii grow service revenue 
in the following pages  we take a look at the  and operating results for items in our consolidated statements of income and also explain key consolidated balance sheet accounts in greater detail 
results of operations total revenues our total revenues include premiums earned  net investment income  net realized investment gains losses and service revenue 
the following table summarizes the components of our revenues and premiums in force s year ended december  gross premiums earned premiums ceded premiums earned net investment income realized investment gains losses realized investment gains realized investment losses net realized investment gains service revenue total revenues premiums in force by region at year end minnesota colorado michigan total premiums in force premiums in force and gross premiums earned premiums on workers compensation insurance policies are our largest source of revenue 
premiums earned are the gross premiums earned by us on in force workers compensation policies  net of the effects of ceded premiums under reinsurance agreements 
the premium we charge a policyholder is a function of the policyholder s payroll  industry and prior workers compensation claims experience 
in underwriting a policy  we receive policyholder payroll estimates for the ensuing year 
we record premiums written on an installment basis matching our billing to the policyholder and earn premiums on a daily basis over the life of each insurance policy based on the payroll estimate 
we record the excess of premiums billed over premiums earned for each policy as unearned premiums on our balance sheet 
when a policy expires  we audit policyholder payrolls for the policy period and adjust the estimated payroll to its actual value 
the result is a final audit adjustment recorded to premiums earned when the adjustment becomes known 
final audit premiums recognized during the period include billed final audit premiums plus or minus the change in estimate for premiums on unexpired and expired unaudited policies 

table of contents our premiums in force decreased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  premiums in force in our minnesota  colorado and michigan regions decreased million  million and million  respectively  at the end of compared to the end of average premiums in force decreased to million in from million in but increased from million in premiums in force decreased in as we focused on maintaining adequate pricing and declined business where we could not get a price that gave us an appropriate opportunity to earn a profit 
we are in the midst of a soft cycle in the insurance market 
we write to achieve an expected profit  no matter what our competitors do 
in and  we were able to grow our business while gaining appropriate pricing on our policies written 
our average annual premium per policy increased to  in from  in and  in our gross premiums earned decreased to million in from million in this decrease resulted primarily from i the decrease in average premiums in force  offset by  ii a slight increase in final audit premiums which increased gross premiums earned by million in compared to million in our gross premiums earned increased to million in from million in this increase resulted primarily from i the increase in average premiums in force  offset by  ii an increase in final audit premiums which increased gross premiums earned by million in compared to a  increase in premium rates on renewing policies decreased an average of in  compared to increases of and in and  respectively 
the decrease reflects heightened price competition due to the soft insurance market cycle in the markets in which we write premiums 
premiums ceded reinsurance agreements enable us to share certain risks with other insurance companies 
we purchase reinsurance to protect us from potential losses in excess of the level we are willing to accept 
we expect the companies to which we have ceded reinsurance to honor their obligations 
in the event that these companies are unable to honor their obligations to us  we will be required to pay the underlying obligations ourselves 
we are not aware of any developments with respect to any of our reinsurers that would result in our current reinsurance balances becoming uncollectible 

table of contents under our excess of loss reinsurance policies  we pay reinsurers to limit our per incident exposure and record this cost to premiums ceded as a reduction of gross premiums earned 
in minnesota  we are required to purchase excess of loss coverage for our minnesota policies from the minnesota workers compensation reinsurance association wcra 
we purchased reinsurance for in our states other than minnesota from four reinsurers 
the following table summarizes our reinsurance coverage all losses ceded on a per occurrence basis covers losses per occurrence in excess of limited to minnesota wcra  statutory limit various reinsurers wcra  statutory limit various reinsurers wcra  statutory limit various reinsurers other states various reinsurers  million  excluding acts of terrorism various reinsurers  million  excluding acts of terrorism various reinsurers  million  excluding acts of terrorism premiums ceded to reinsurers increased to million in from million in as a percent of gross premiums earned  premiums ceded increased to in from in the increase in premiums ceded reflects a rate increase for excess of loss reinsurance coverage in all regions in the rates we are charged are lower for minnesota risks compared to our other states risks 
premiums ceded to reinsurers increased to million in from million in the increase in premiums ceded resulted primarily from i our cost for excess of loss reinsurance coverage increased substantially in all regions in  ii gross premiums earned in increased from  and iii the results include a  decrease in excess of loss premiums ceded  resulting from a change in estimated reinsurance cost for the wcra compared to a  increase in excess of loss premiums ceded in outlook the outlook for premiums in force  gross premiums earned and premiums ceded include the following factors we expect increased price competition in the markets in which we operate  which will exert downward pressure on premium pricing on new and renewal policies as national and regional carriers focus on writing and retaining workers compensation insurance 
we expect to add new agency relationships in and terminate some that are not performing well 
we expect growth in premiums in force in as we expand our underwriting niche  write multi state policies and begin leveraging unused licenses  our gross premiums earned will move in the same direction as our premiums in force  lagging slightly as premiums are earned over the term of the insurance policy  and we continue to limit our exposure to large losses by purchasing excess of loss reinsurance for losses in excess of  in all our regions in the cost of excess of loss reinsurance has decreased slightly or remained the same for all regions in  however  because of a shift in premiums earned to higher reinsurance cost states  we expect premiums ceded under excess of loss policies to increase as a percent of gross premiums earned in when compared to the results attained for net investment income and net realized investment gains losses net investment income includes earnings from our investment portfolio  reduced by expenses incurred in managing the portfolio 
our net 
table of contents realized investment gains losses  displayed separately on our accompanying consolidated statements of income  include gains and losses from sales of securities 
we currently invest entirely in us domiciled investment grade taxable and tax exempt fixed maturity investments and classify our investments as available for sale 
our primary investment objective is to maintain a diversified  high quality  fixed investment portfolio structured to maximize our after tax net investment income without taking inappropriate credit risk 
for further discussion of investments  see the investments section of this management s discussion and analysis 
at december   we were invested entirely in us domiciled investment grade taxable fixed maturity investments 
we added us domiciled investment grade tax exempt fixed maturity investments in to take advantage of the tax benefits of those securities and interest rate spreads 
we held cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
in order to reduce the near term interest rate risk on the portfolio  we built our cash position throughout and by holding cash received on mortgage backed security prepayments and through sales of securities expecting interest rates would rise in during  we began to invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents into longer maturing  fixed rate securities 
we intend to hold our available for sale investments to maturity 
net investment income increased to million in from million in in late  yields on short maturity instruments began to improve 
this improvement continued throughout and resulted in a relatively flat yield curve 
the yield curve change benefited our yields on cash and cash equivalents 
later in the year  we further enhanced our net investment income realized on cash and cash equivalents by structuring a cash ladder to improve yields without taking undue risk 
total invested assets investments  cash and cash equivalents increased from million at december  to million at december  our book investment yield  excluding cash and cash equivalents  decreased to at december  from at december  as maturities occurred and pay downs on mortgage backed securities occurred  we decreased our average maturity and duration to minimize interest rate risk 
the investment yields realized in future periods will be affected by yields attained on new investments 
net investment income decreased to million in from million in this decrease in net investment income resulted from the decrease in our average book interest rates during and was partially offset by the increase in assets invested  to million in from million in interest rates at december  were at approximately the same levels as december approximately million of mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio were repaid earlier than expected due to consumer mortgage refinancing and normal repayment patterns that occurred in an additional million of other securities matured during the funds that became available could not be reinvested at comparable rates  causing the book investment yield to decline from our book investment yield  excluding cash and cash equivalents  declined to at december  from at december  in  and  we sold certain securities within the portfolio to take advantage of favorable interest rates and realized net investment gains totaling   and  respectively 
outlook we expect that income from our investment portfolio for will be affected by the following we expect interest rates to increase in the timing of any such rate increases is unknown at this time 
we intend to invest our excess cash into higher yielding investments in as rates increase  we expect that short term interest rates on cash and cash equivalents will increase in as the federal reserve board increases its rates  our investment in tax exempt municipal bonds will reduce net investment income and favorably affect net income as investment yields will be lower on a pre tax basis but will be higher on a tax adjusted basis  cash flows for are expected to be affected by decreases in cash flows resulting from claim payments on claims from and prior years offset by cash flows from our premiums and service revenue  
table of contents recognition of realized investment gains and losses will depend on sales of our investments  if any  to meet our short term cash requirements or as we reposition our portfolio to further manage our portfolio returns 
we do not anticipate selling any securities in  and new and renegotiated reinsurance treaties may affect our future cash flow and future net investment income 
service revenue service revenue includes revenues for services that are i billed as a percent of premium of insurance policies issued by non affiliated third party insurers  ii billed based on the number and type of claims serviced  iii billed on an hourly basis based on direct activity  or iv billed based on contract duration 
our customers include the minnesota workers compensation assigned risk plan arp  self insured employers  other insurance companies  insurance agents and local governmental units 
service revenue grew to million in from  in and  in annualized service revenue was million at december  annualized service revenue represents the estimated total value of service contracts that are in place at any point in time 
outlook service revenue will increase significantly in due to the following in march  we were awarded a three year contract to service of the arp 
we are paid a fee based on a percent of the premium we service and began servicing new arp business on july  and renewal arp business on september  during  we continued to ramp up our servicing of this contract  achieving a full share in september the total annual premium in the arp at december  is approximately million  which decreased from million at december  we expect the total annual premium in the arp to continue to decrease slightly during  which will exert downward pressure on our related revenue  offset by being at a full servicing rate for the entire year  and we continue to market our alternative products aggressively inside and outside the regions in which we currently operate 
we expect service revenue will increase as new customers become aware of and purchase these services 
the ultimate effect on service revenue is unknown at this time 
total expenses our expenses include claim and claim settlement expenses  policy acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses and income taxes 
claim and claim settlement expenses claim expenses refer to medical and indemnity benefits that we paid or expect to pay to claimants for past events we insured 
the costs of investigating  resolving and processing these claims are referred to as claim settlement expenses 
we record these expenses  net of amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts  to claim and claim settlement expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
claim and claim settlement expenses are our largest expense and result in our largest liability 
we establish reserves that reflect our estimates of the total claim and claim settlement expenses we will ultimately have to pay under our workers compensation insurance policies 
these include claims that have been reported but not yet settled and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
for further discussion of reserve determination  see the unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables sections of this management s discussion and analysis 
the number of estimated ultimate claims by accident year decreased to approximately  in from  in and  in  correlating directly to the decrease in gross earned premiums 
the gross and net average estimated cost per claim which includes both claim and claim settlement expenses totaled approximately  and  in compared to  and  in and  and  in  respectively 
the and increases in gross and net average estimated cost per claim  when compared to the data  is primarily the result of increases in claim severity  offset by our improved ability to manage cases and claims 
the trend of increasing severity is attributable to a combination of factors that include increasing medical and indemnity costs reimbursements to injured workers for lost wages per claim and a decline in the number of claims being reported over the last several years 
the declining frequency 
table of contents of claims contributes to the increasing severity trend because the frequency decline has been concentrated in less expensive claims claims involving less time off from work and less severe injuries 
at december   the number of claims reported but unpaid open claims and the approximate average gross and net reserves on the claims occurring in the following accident years were average gross average net open claims reserve reserve the average gross and net reserves per claim are less in than in and as the open claims include newly reported claims from the last half of  including many with much lower severity that have not had time to close  as well as new claims that are incurred but not yet reported 
the remaining open claims from and are primarily claims with significant injury characteristics resulting in the increase in outstanding average gross and net reserves per claim 
compared to claim and claim settlement expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percent of premiums earned  claim and claim settlement expenses decreased to in from in these changes are due to the following the decrease in gross premiums earned as discussed above under premiums in force and gross premiums earned  the results include a million decrease in prior accident years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results  which include a million decrease in prior accident years reserves 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i our ability to manage and close claims has improved over our historical experience  ii the re underwriting of our book of business has resulted in claims with profiles different than experienced historically  and iii our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is volatile due to our relatively limited fourteen year historical claim data and our small claim population  and claim costs continued to reflect increasing medical and indemnity costs in accident year as compared to accident year resulting from inflationary pressures 
compared to claim and claim settlement expenses increased to million in from million in as a percent of premiums earned  claim and claim settlement expenses increased to in from in these changes are due to the following the increase in gross premiums earned as discussed above under premiums in force and gross premiums earned  the results include a million decrease in prior accident years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses compared to the results  which include a million decrease in prior accident years reserves 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i our ability to manage and close claims has improved over our historical experience  ii the re underwriting of our book of business has resulted in claims with profiles different than experienced historically  and iii our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is volatile due to our relatively limited historical claim data and our small claim population  and claim costs continued to reflect increasing medical and indemnity costs in accident year as compared to accident year resulting from inflationary pressures 

table of contents outlook we expect that claim and claim settlement expenses will be affected by the following factors claim costs will continue to be affected by i increases in medical and indemnity costs resulting from inflationary changes  ii severity experienced in current and future periods in our policyholder base  iii changes resulting from increases in operating efficiency and effectiveness realized through enhancements to our internal processes and procedures  including changes to our proprietary computer systems  and iv legislative changes that affect benefits payable under workers compensation laws  increases decreases in premium rates will have a direct affect on gross premiums earned without a corresponding effect on claim and claim settlement expenses  ultimately affecting claim and claim settlement expense as a percent of premiums earned 
legislative changes in estimated loss costs  increased competition and changes in customer loss experience may offset or eliminate the effect of any rate improvement  and continued application of our claims management technology and methods to all open claims 
the ultimate effect of the above factors on claim and claim settlement expenses is unknown at this time 
policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs are costs directly related to writing an insurance policy and include commissions  state premium taxes  underwriting personnel costs and expenses  sales and marketing costs and other underwriting expenses  less ceding commissions received from our reinsurers 
ceding commissions are amounts that reinsurers pay to us for placing reinsurance with them 
the following table summarizes policy acquisition costs s year ended december  commission expense premium tax expense other policy acquisition costs direct policy acquisition costs ceding commission on excess of loss reinsurance total policy acquisition costs under certain of our excess of loss reinsurance policies  the reinsurer returns a portion of the premiums we cede as ceding commissions to reimburse us for our cost of placing and managing policies 
ceding commissions received under excess of loss reinsurance policies totaled million in compared to million in and million in these ceding commissions reduced our policy acquisition costs 
excluding the effect of ceding commissions  policy acquisition costs were million in  million in and million in as a percent of gross premiums earned  direct policy acquisition costs were in compared to in and in the changes in  and reflect the following gross premiums earned decreased in compared to resulting in a corresponding decrease in policy acquisition costs  commission expense decreased to of gross premiums earned in from in and in the decreased commission rates are the result of the decrease in our new business in relative to and and the focus on reducing the commissions we pay 
in all of our markets  we believe the commission rates we pay are marketplace competitive  premium tax expense paid to states was of gross premiums earned in  of gross premiums earned in and of gross premiums earned in  and other policy acquisition costs consist of personnel and overhead costs  various state and regulatory assessments related to second injury funds and mandatory state pools  payroll audit vendor costs and 
table of contents the net effect of assigned risk plan activity in the states in which we operate 
other policy acquisition costs were affected by the following i in  we recorded a  increase in other policy acquisition costs reflecting a re allocation of prior year mandatory reinsurance pool expenses  compared to a  increase recorded in and a million increase recorded in  and ii a general change related to the increase or decrease in gross premiums earned 
excluding the mandatory pool re allocation discussed above  other policy acquisition costs as a percentage of gross premiums earned were in  in and in outlook we expect that policy acquisition costs in will be affected by the following our commission expense will continue to be affected by how much new business we write relative to renewal business as we pay higher commissions on new policies  premium tax accrual rates will remain relatively constant at approximately in  and other underwriting expenses will continue to be affected by pool reimbursements offset by pool disbursements  the effect of which is not known at this time 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include personnel costs  office rent  certain state administrative charges based on premiums and other costs and expenses not specific to claim and claim settlement expenses or policy acquisition costs 
all costs associated with our service business are included in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and million in as a percent of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in and in these changes reflect the following general and administrative expenses increased in from levels 
significant changes include i we added staff and other general and administrative expenses to deliver the services associated with the service revenue increase to million in from  in  ii bonus expense was million in compared to million in  and iii bad debt expense was  in compared to a benefit of  in  principally due to customer bankruptcies in our michigan region  and  general and administrative expenses decreased in from levels 
significant changes include i the reversal of a previously recorded contingent reinsurance commission resulting in  in expense in  ii bonus expense was million in compared to  in  iii bad debt expense was  lower in  and iv we operated with fewer average headcount in compared to outlook we expect that general and administrative expenses will be affected by the following our contract to manage the arp business and continued growth in our service revenue will require staff additions and increase our general and administrative expense  we will make appropriate investments in infrastructure to position us for future growth of our service revenue and to continue to support and enhance our core insurance operations  although we have no current plans to open additional offices in  if growth opportunities warrant opening a new office  we will evaluate the opportunity as presented  and all expenses will continue to be aggressively managed and reduced where appropriate 
income taxes we incur federal income taxes on our combined service organization rtw and absentia operations and insurance operations acic and bcic 
we incur state income taxes on the results of our service organization s operations and incur premium taxes in lieu of state income taxes for our insurance operations 
in certain instances  we may incur state income taxes on our insurance operations 
additionally  certain provisions of the internal revenue code adversely affect our taxable income by accelerating recognition and payment of income taxes 
adjustments to book income generating current tax liabilities 
table of contents include limitations on the deductibility of unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses  limitations on the deductibility of unearned premium reserves and limitations on deductions for bad debt reserves 
in assessing our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider recent operating results  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
at december   we established a million valuation allowance allowance against deferred tax assets resulting in a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
this allowance decreased by million to million at december  as a result of the income we earned in and federal tax refunds totaling million resulting from a change in federal tax law 
this allowance was further decreased by million in to million as a result of the income we earned in and our analysis of projected taxable income 
we eliminated the deferred tax valuation allowance and recorded a million benefit to income taxes in income tax expense for does not include a benefit from reducing the valuation allowance since it was fully utilized in prior years 
we expect our deferred tax assets at december  to be realized as a result of future income and the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences 
after adjusting for the valuation allowance benefit recorded in and  income tax expense was million for compared to million for and million for as a percent of income before income taxes  the income tax expense before any benefit from reducing the allowance was of the income before income taxes in compared to in and in the income tax expense percentages for  and have been affected by i our income from operations  ii the amount of municipal bond income we have earned  iii adjustments for changes in estimates from prior periods that have affected the year to year comparison of income tax expense  and iv changes in taxable net income from our insurance subsidiaries which are subject to only federal income taxes 
outlook income tax expense will vary based on i our results of operations  ii the amount of tax exempt income we earn  and iii the growth of our service revenue 
the ultimate change is unknown at this time 
investments our portfolio of fixed maturity securities at december  included us government securities  mortgage backed securities  municipal securities  commercial paper and asset backed securities 
our portfolio is managed by an independent investment manager to maximize our after tax net investment income without taking inappropriate credit risk 
in  and  we sold certain securities within the portfolio to take advantage of favorable interest rates and realized net investment gains totaling   and  respectively 
we conservatively manage our fixed maturity portfolio  investing only in investment grade bbb or better rating from standard and poor s securities of us domiciled issuers 
all securities in our portfolio were rated aaa  aa or a at december  we do not invest in derivative securities 
operating cash flows consist of the deficit or excess of premiums collected over claim and claim settlement expenses paid  reduced by payments for reinsurance premiums  as well as service revenue collected and other operating expenses paid 
investment cash flows consist of income on existing investments and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
our investment portfolio increased million to million at december  from million at december  during and  interest rates declined  leading to significant mortgage refinancing by consumers  resulting in significant prepayment or early redemption of our mortgage backed securities 
in order to reduce the near term interest rate risk on the portfolio  we built our cash position throughout by holding cash received on mortgage backed security pre payments and through sales of securities  expecting that interest rates would rise in during  we began to invest a portion of our cash and cash equivalents into longer maturing  fixed rate securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared to million at december  we expect that cash will decrease and investments will increase in as we continue to invest available cash into additional fixed income securities 

table of contents we record investments on our balance sheet at fair value  with the corresponding appreciation or depreciation from amortized cost recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
because value is based on the relationship between the portfolio s stated yields and prevailing market yields at any given time  interest rate fluctuations can have a swift and significant impact on the carrying value of these securities 
as a result of classifying our securities as available for sale  and thus carrying them at fair value  we expect to encounter adjustments in shareholders equity as market interest rates and other factors change 
at december   we had a million net unrealized loss on investments at december  compared to a  net unrealized gain at december  unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses relate solely to our insurance operations 
our absentia division and service business does not bear claim risk for its customers and carries no unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
at december   net reserves totaled million and included the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses of million net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses of million 
the net reserve at december  totaled million and included the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses totaling million net of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses of million 
accounting for workers compensation insurance operations requires us to estimate the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses reserves and the related reinsurance recoverables  together  the net reserves at each balance sheet date 
our reserves at december  represent the estimated total unpaid cost of claim and claim settlement expenses that cover events that occurred in and prior years 
these reserves reflect our estimates of the total costs of claims that were reported  but not yet paid  and the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
for reported claims  we establish reserves on a case basis 
for ibnr claims  we calculate the difference between i projected ultimate claim and claim settlement expenses as determined using generally accepted actuarial standards  and ii case reserves and carry the difference as an ibnr reserve 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr claims  we estimate the ultimate net reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
the amount by which estimated net reserves  measured subsequently by reference to payments and additional estimates  differ from those originally reported for a period is known as development 
development is unfavorable deficient when losses ultimately settle for more than the levels at which they were reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims 
development is favorable redundant when losses ultimately settle for less than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reducing loss reserves on open claims 
favorable or unfavorable development of loss reserves is reflected in earnings in the year realized 
both internal and independent external actuaries review our net reserves for adequacy on a periodic basis 
these reviews assume that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current events and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
when reviewing net reserves  actuaries analyze historical data and estimate the effect of various factors on estimated ultimate reserves including i trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of medical and wage inflation  ii estimates of trends in claims frequency and severity  iii our and industry historical loss experience  and iv legislative enactments  legal developments and changes in social and political attitudes 
variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events  including changes in claims handling procedures  economic inflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the effect of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual redundancy or deficiency is affected by many factors 
additionally  there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the loss and the time it is actually reported to the insurer 
due to our commencing operations in  we have limited historical data to estimate our reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid 
table of contents claim and claim settlement expenses 
accordingly  we supplement our experience with external industry data  as adjusted  to reflect anticipated differences between our results and the industry 
estimating the effect that inflation will have on the ultimate cost of claims is a major risk factor in our workers compensation reserve estimates 
future earnings will be affected by reserve development associated with any changes in our inflation assumptions 
estimates for the and accident years represent the majority of the net reserves of the uncertainty because these claims have the lowest proportionate amount of paid loss as of december  our reserve estimates are most sensitive to changes in the assumption about inflation for the and accident years 
each one percent increase or decrease in the inflation rate for each of these accident years would increase or decrease our net loss reserve estimates at december  by approximately  our independent actuary provides us with an annual actuarial opinion regarding the acceptable range for adequate statutory reserves based on generally accepted actuarial guidelines 
we record our net reserves by considering a range of estimates bounded by the high and low point of the range 
within that range  we record our best estimate 
at december   we established recorded reserves in the upper end of the actuary s range based on our historical loss reserve development 
the ultimate actual liability may be higher or lower than reserves recorded 
our reserves are primarily undiscounted  however  we discounted reserves for selected claims that have fixed and determinable future payments at rates ranging from to in and the discount rates are subject to change as market interest rates change 
we use the same rates for us generally accepted accounting principles gaap as we do for statutory accounting practices sap in determining our liability 
we also reduce the unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses for estimated amounts of subrogation 
we continually monitor loss development trends and data to establish adequate premium rates and to determine reasonable reserve estimates 
reserves that are based on estimates are inherently uncertain and represent a significant risk to the business 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by continually improving and refining our workers compensation claims processing practices and by continual monitoring through actuarial estimation methods 
after taking into account all relevant factors  we believe our reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses and reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses at december  are adequate to cover the ultimate net costs of claim and claim settlement expenses at that date 
the ultimate cost of claim and claim settlement expenses may differ materially from the established reserves  particularly when claims may not be settled for many years 
establishing appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following two tables reconcile the beginning and ending insurance reserves  displayed individually for each of the last three years 

table of contents the following table sets forth reserves on a gross before reinsurance basis s year ended december  gross reserves for claim and claim settlement expenses gross reserves for claim and claim settlement expenses  beginning of year provision increases decreases for claim and claim settlement expenses current year prior years total provision payments for claim and claim settlement expenses current year prior years total payments gross reserves for claim and claim settlement expenses  end of year the following table sets forth reserves on a net after reinsurance basis s year ended december  net reserves for claim and claim settlement expenses net reserves for claim and claim settlement expenses  beginning of year plus deferred retrospective reinsurance gain  beginning of year provision increases decreases for claim and claim settlement expenses current year prior years total provision payments for claim and claim settlement expenses current year prior years total payments less deferred retrospective reinsurance gain  end of year net reserves for claim and claim settlement expenses  end of year 
table of contents the following gross loss reserve development table sets forth the change  over time  of gross reserves established for claim and claim settlement expenses at the end of the last ten years 
the table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both current and prior years s december  s loss reserve development gross reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses paid cumulative as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later reserves re estimated as of end of year one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later initial reserves in excess of less than re estimated reserves amount percent the table above represents the development of balance sheet gross reserves for through the upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded reserves as of the end of each succeeding year 
the lower portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded gross reserves  based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is either increased or decreased as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
the initial reserves in excess of less than re estimated reserves amount and percent rows represent the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
for example  the reserve developed a million net deficiency over the course of the succeeding years 
in evaluating this information  it should be noted that each amount includes the total of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  the amount of redundancy deficiency to losses settled in  but incurred in  is included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency amounts in  and this table does not present accident or policy year development data  which certain readers may be more accustomed to analyzing 
conditions and trends that have affected development of the reserves in the past 
table of contents may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
the following net loss reserve development table sets forth the change  over time  of net reserves established for claim and claim settlement expenses at the end of the last ten years 
the table is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both current and prior years s december  loss reserve development gross reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses reinsurance recoverables net reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses paid cumulative as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later reserves re estimated as of end of year one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later initial reserves in excess of less than re estimated reserves amount percent the table above represents the development of balance sheet net reserves for through the top three rows of the table reconcile gross reserves to net reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years 
the upper portion of the table shows the cumulative amount paid with respect to the previously recorded reserves as of the end of each succeeding year 
the lower portion of the table shows the re estimated amount of the previously recorded net reserves  based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year 
the estimate is either increased or decreased as 
table of contents more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years 
for example  for the calendar year valued as of december   we paid million of the currently estimated million of claim and claim settlement expenses that were incurred through the end of thus  the difference  an estimated million of claim and claim settlement expenses incurred through  remained unpaid as of december  the initial reserves in excess of less than re estimated reserves amount and percent rows represent the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years 
for example  the reserve developed a million net deficiency over the course of the succeeding years 
the net amount has been included in income and the changes have been recorded in the period identified 
the cumulative net deficiencies in and are the result of reserve development inherent in the uncertainty in establishing reserves and anticipated loss trends 
as discussed above  due to our relatively limited historical claim data and small claim population  our estimate of the liability for net reserves is difficult and volatile 
as discussed further below  the reserve redundancy in is the result of accrual reversals resulting from changes in methods of assessing second injury funds  lower frequency in claims reported from the estimate at december   and reductions in amounts expected to be incurred for our participation in mandatory state and national assigned risk pools 
in evaluating this information  it should be noted that each amount includes the total of all changes in amounts for prior periods 
for example  the amount of redundancy to losses settled in  but incurred in  will be included in the cumulative redundancy deficiency amounts in   and this table does not present accident or policy year development data  which certain readers may be more accustomed to analyzing 
conditions and trends that have affected development of the reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
the following table is derived from the net loss reserve development table and summarizes the effect of reserve re estimates  net of reinsurance  on calendar year operations for the same ten year period ended december  the total of each column details the amount of reserve re estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the re estimates are applicable 
the amounts in the total accident year column represent the cumulative reserve re estimate increase decrease for the indicated accident year s cumulative re estimates effect of reserve re estimates on calendar year operations for each accident pre year accident year total 
table of contents the results include a million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses 
our estimate for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses decreased in due to the following i our ability to manage and close claims has improved over our historical experience  ii the re underwriting of our book of business has resulted in claims with profiles different than experienced historically  and iii our estimate of the liability for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses is volatile due to our relatively limited fourteen year historical claim data and our small claim population 
the results include a million decrease in prior years reserves for unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses

liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of our operations 
capital resources represent those funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations 
our primary sources of cash from operations are insurance premiums collected  reimbursements under reinsurance contracts  service revenue collected and net investment income 
our primary cash requirements consist of payments for i claim and claim settlement expenses  ii reinsurance  iii policy acquisition costs  iv general and administrative expenses  v capital expenditures  and vi income taxes 
we generate cash from or use cash in operations based on timing differences between the receipt of premiums and the payment of claim and claim settlement expenses 
selected reinsurance retention levels also use cash as a result of pre funding premiums under the policies or provide cash upon reimbursement of claim payments 
in and  reinsurance reimbursements from our  to  excess of loss reinsurance agreement  which began in mid and ran off in  offset similar payments to claimants for those years 
this trend will continue in we further expect that cash and cash equivalents will decrease from levels reported at december  as we take advantage of the anticipated increase in interest rates to purchase fixed maturity investments 
available cash is invested in either short term cash and cash equivalents or longer term available for sale securities pending future payments for such expenses as medical and indemnity benefits and other operating expenses 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash  a money market fund that invests primarily in short term us government securities  commercial paper with maturities of three months or less and overnight repurchase agreements secured by us treasury or us government agency securities 
cash provided by operating activities was million for this is primarily a result of net income of million and an increase of million in unpaid claim and claim settlement expenses offset by an increase in amounts due from reinsurers of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million due primarily to million in purchases of securities offset by million in proceeds from sales of securities and million in maturities of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was  due to the exercise of stock options in our need for additional capital is primarily the result of regulations that require certain ratios of regulatory or statutory capital to premiums written in our insurance subsidiary as defined by state regulatory bodies and insurance rating agencies 
raising additional permanent capital would further reduce our ratio of premium to capital and provide a solid base for the future growth of our insurance subsidiary 
as an alternative to raising additional permanent capital  certain reinsurance contracts could be used on an interim basis that 
table of contents would have the effect of reducing the ratio of premiums to capital and surplus in acic to satisfy state regulatory requirements 
minnesota state insurance regulations limit distributions  including dividends  from our insurance subsidiary to us 
under minnesota insurance law regulating the payment of dividends  in any twelve month period  acic can pay a dividend to us from its earned surplus unassigned surplus not to exceed the greater of of acic s total surplus or acic s prior years net income reduced for realized capital gains net of income taxes 
at december   acic could pay a dividend to us totaling million without the approval of the minnesota department of commerce see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
acic has never paid a dividend to us  and we intend to retain capital in the insurance subsidiaries 
on september   our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase  from time to time  up to  of rtw  inc common stock 
no shares were repurchased under this program in or we repurchased  shares in for approximately  we repurchased these shares on the open market or through private transactions based upon market conditions and availability 
the repurchased shares will be used for employee stock option and purchase plans and other corporate purposes 
at december   investments with a market value of million were held as statutory deposits and pledged as collateral 
investments held as statutory deposits and pledged as collateral do not currently have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
we believe that cash flow generated by our operations and our cash and investment balances will be sufficient to fund continuing operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist solely of operating leases for our facilities 
future minimum base rental payments required under the leases  as of december   are as follows s interest rate risk our fixed maturity investments are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
we regularly evaluate interest rate risk in order to evaluate the appropriateness of our investments 
an increase of basis points in prevailing interest rates would reduce the fair value of our interest rate sensitive instruments by approximately million 
the effect of interest rate risk on potential near term fair value was determined based on commonly used models 
the models project the impact of interest rate changes on factors such as duration  prepayments  put options and call options 
fair value was determined based on the net present value of cash flows or duration estimates  using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios 
naic risk based capital standards the national association of insurance commissioners naic has risk based capital standards to determine the capital requirements of a property and casualty insurance carrier based upon the risks inherent 
table of contents in its operations 
these standards require computing a risk based capital amount that is compared to a carrier s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset risk  insurance underwriting risk  credit risk  and off balance sheet risk 
these standards provide for regulatory intervention when the percent of total adjusted capital to authorized control level risk based capital is below certain levels 
based upon the risk based capital standards  our percent of total adjusted capital is in excess of authorized control level risk based capital 
regulation our insurance subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation by governmental agencies in the states in which we operate  and will be subject to such regulation in any state in which we provide workers compensation products and services in the future 
state regulatory agencies have broad administrative power with respect to all aspects of our business  including premium rates  benefit levels  policy forms  dividend payments  capital adequacy and the amount and type of investments 
these regulations are primarily intended to protect covered employees and policyholders rather than the insurance company 
both the legislation covering insurance companies and the regulations adopted by state agencies are subject to change 
at december   acic was licensed to do business in twenty three states while bcic was licensed only in minnesota 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb finalized fasb staff position fsp emerging issues task force eitf issue a and issued re titled fsp statement of financial accounting standard sfas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the fsp provides guidance on the recognition of impairments deemed other than temporary 
fsp is effective for other than temporary impairment analysis conducted in periods beginning after december  we believe that our current policy for other than temporary impairments complies with fsp accordingly  the adoption of this standard has not had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award ie  the requisite service period  which is usually equal to the vesting period 
in accordance with the transitional guidance given in the statement  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service period has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas no 
for either recognition or pro forma disclosure requirements 
in april  the securities and exchange commission delayed the effective date of implementing sfas no 
r until fiscal years beginning after june  we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop 
sop provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than those specifically described in fas  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
sop defines an internal replacement as a modification in product benefits  features  rights or coverages that occurs by the exchange of a contract for a new contract  or by amendment  endorsement  or rider to a contract  or by election of a feature or coverage within a contract 
sop is effective for internal replacements occurring in the fiscal year beginning after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the company only issues workers compensation insurance policies  which are a statutory coverage and are not subject to internal 
table of contents replacement or modification in product benefits  features  right or coverages 
the company does not expect the impact of adoption sop to have a significant effect on operations  financial condition or liquidity
