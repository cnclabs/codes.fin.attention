adjustment to previously issued financial statements we are filing this annual report on form k for the year ended june  with adjustments to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended july  and july  and the related disclosures 
this form k also includes adjustments to selected financial data as of and for the years ended june  and june   which is included in item we have adjusted our consolidated financial statements for the years ended july  and july   as well as the selected financial data for the years ended june  and june   to record additional non cash stock based compensation expense  and related tax accruals  resulting from stock options granted during fiscal years to that were incorrectly accounted for under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our decision to adjust our financial statements was based on the facts obtained from an independent investigation into our stock option accounting that was conducted under the direction of a special committee special committee of our board of directors 
the board created the special committee  which was composed solely of independent directors  to conduct a voluntary  company initiated review of matters related to past stock option grants  including the timing of such grants and associated documentation 
the special committee reviewed all option grants of the company during the period from july  through june  the review period 
the special committee reviewed corporate records and electronic documentation and interviewed current and former employees and directors 
the special committee presented its investigative findings and recommendations to the board of directors and our independent auditors  kpmg llp 
at the completion of its investigation  the special committee identified  and our management concurred  that the appropriate measurement date for option grants made on separate grant dates during the period from fiscal through fiscal differed from the originally stated grant dates for such awards 
because the prices at the originally stated grant dates were  in of such instances  lower than the prices on the appropriate measurement dates for such grants  our management determined we should have recognized stock based compensation expense and additional tax expense in our historical financial statements for these grants 
for the remaining grants  since the prices at the originally stated grant dates were at or above the prices on the appropriate measurement dates for such grants  we determined that no accounting adjustment should be made for these grants 
key findings from the special committee s investigation include found no evidence that anyone manipulated the grant documentation or grant dates in order to avoid compensation expense or other financial statement impacts 
found no misconduct by any member of our current management team 
for grants made during the period from fiscal through fiscal  our stock price at the appropriate measurement date was higher than the price on the originally stated grant dates 
as a result  we should have recognized stock based compensation expense and additional tax expense in our historical financial statements for these grants 
based on these findings  we have determined we should have recognized approximately million of stock based compensation and tax related expenses 
approximately million  before tax related expenses  of these additional expenses were attributable to annual employee stock option grants made by the compensation committee in november and and a special employee grant made in march for which there was inadequate or no support for selection of the grant dates  and the grant dates were at a low price in the relevant period 
these grants were made by unanimous written consent of the compensation committee of our board 
the special committee concluded that the annual employee stock option grant made in november was intentionally dated with hindsight at a low price 
while improper  no evidence was found that this action was taken to avoid compensation expense or other financial statement impacts 

table of contents approximately million  before tax related expenses  of these additional expenses were attributable to annual employee stock option grants made in september and for these grants  acting at a meeting  the compensation committee approved specific grants for section b officers and an overall budgeted number of shares for grants to employees that were not section b officers to be allocated by later management action 
the allocation of awards to employees that were not section b officers was not completed with finality by the grant date 
approximately million  before tax related expenses  additional expenses were attributable to grants involving a variety of administrative errors  including errors in administration of grants to new hires and in connection with promotions  and errors in supporting documentation 
we determined that the cumulative pre tax non cash stock based compensation expense resulting from revised measurement dates was approximately million for fiscal years to this additional compensation expense relates to stock options covering approximately million shares 
additionally  we have recorded million in tax related expenses resulting from the recharacterization of incentive stock options to non qualified stock options for fiscal years to the following table summarizes the impact of the related adjustments in millions years ended june  july  july  fiscal years to total stock based compensation expense tax related expenses total the following table reflects the consolidated income statement classification of the additional stock based compensation and tax related expenses related to the adjustment for fiscal years to cost of revenue research and development expense selling  general and administrative expense provision for income taxes total the adjustments reduce previously reported diluted earnings per share diluted eps by each for both of the years ended july  and july  given that we have concluded that the foregoing adjustments were not material to our historical consolidated financial statements  we have not amended  and do not intend to amend  any of our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the periods affected by the adjustments
