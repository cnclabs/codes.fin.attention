item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis provides qualitative and quantitative information about our financial performance and condition and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those statements 
this discussion consists of the following sections executive overview a description of our business  financial highlights from  information about industry trends and sources of revenues and operating costs  critical accounting policies and estimates a discussion of the accounting policies that are most important in understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the consolidated financial statements and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements  results of operations a summary of the components of our revenues by category and by network affiliation  a summary of other operating data and an analysis of our revenues and expenses for  and  including comparisons between years and expectations for  and liquidity and capital resources a discussion of our primary sources of liquidity  an analysis of our cash flows from or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  a discussion of our dividend policy and a summary of our contractual cash obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
executive overview we are one of the largest and most diversified television broadcasting companies in the united states 
we currently own  provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements lmas or provide  or are provided  sales services pursuant to outsourcing agreements to television stations in markets 
for the purpose of this report  these stations are referred to as our stations 
we currently have duopoly markets where we own and operate two stations within the same market 
we have nine lma markets where  with one exception  we own and operate one station in the market and provide programming and operating services to  or by  another station within the market 
in the remaining markets  we own and operate a single television station 
we believe that owning duopolies and operating stations under lmas enables us to accomplish two very important strategic business objectives increasing our share of revenues available in each market and operating television stations more efficiently by minimizing costs 
we constantly monitor revenue share and cost efficiencies and we aggressively pursue opportunities to improve both by using new technology and by sharing best practices among our station groups 
sinclair television group  inc stg  a wholly owned subsidiary of sinclair broadcast group  inc sbg  is the primary obligor under our existing bank credit agreement  as amended  the senior subordinated notes  due and the senior subordinated notes  due our class a common stock  class b common stock  the convertible debentures  due and the convertible senior notes  due remain obligations or securities of sbg and are not obligations or securities of stg 
highlights operating income increased in due to expense controls and greater efficiencies in our direct mail new business initiative  basic and diluted earnings per share were in versus earnings per share of  local time sales  excluding political  increased in as a result of our continued focus on new business initiatives including direct mail  retransmission fees increased million over  including a one time adjustment of million  and  based on current contracts  retransmission fee consideration is expected to be approximately million as a result of our efforts to monetize our retransmission agreements  ratings increases at our abc and fox stations have resulted in revenue share growth in many of our markets  we completed the sales of kovr tv cbs in sacramento  california and ksmo tv wb in kansas city  missouri during and we completed the sale of wemt tv fox in tri cities  tennessee in january we increased our annual dividend rate to per common share at the end of from per common share at the end of  we exchanged our convertible preferred stock for convertible debentures  due in june  we entered into a news share arrangement with wiat tv  the cbs affiliate in birmingham  alabama  in order to improve the performance of our news operations of our wb affiliate wtto tv  and we entered into a joint sales and services agreement with nexstar broadcasting in rochester  new york combining their cbs station with our fox station  in order to improve station performance 
we believe that all of these events will enhance shareholder value 
industry trends political advertising increases in even numbered years  such as  due to the advertising expenditures from candidates running in local and national elections 
in every fourth year  such as  political advertising is elevated further due to the presidential election  seasonal advertising increases in the second and fourth quarters due to the advertising expenditures related to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers  not all cable system operators and satellite providers pay for the analog or digital signals they receive from broadcasters  but we expect more operators and providers will be paying for these signals in the future as alternative competing video delivery providers increase  compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has significantly declined in recent years and may be eliminated in the future in lieu of alternative network and affiliate relationships  automotive related advertising is a significant portion of our total net revenues in all periods presented and these revenues have been trending downward in recent years and we expect this trend to modify in the federal communications commission fcc has mandated that beginning february   all broadcast television stations must broadcast using only a digital signal and will no longer be able to broadcast using an analog signal  the fcc has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi channel broadcasts 
we have announced that we plan to launch a second digital channel using wbff tv s digital signal in baltimore  maryland on may   and many broadcasters are enhancing upgrading their websites to use the internet to deliver rich media content  such as newscasts and weather updates  to attract advertisers 
sources of revenues and costs most of our revenues are generated from the transactional spot market rather than the traditional up front and scatter markets that networks access 
these operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers 
recently  we have begun to generate revenues from our retransmission fee arrangements  which has replaced the steady decline in revenues from television network compensation 
our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of gross broadcast revenue 
we believe this trend is the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  combined with a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and an increase in the number of competitive media outlets providing national advertisers multiple alternatives in which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of these increasing competitive media outlets for national advertisers include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative sales and marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to our advertisers 
our primary operating expenses are syndicated program rights fees  commissions on revenues  employee salaries  news gathering and station promotional costs 
amortization and depreciation of costs other than goodwill associated with the acquisition of our stations and interest carrying charges are significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  program contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  property and equipment  investments and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
advertising revenues  net of agency and national representatives commissions  are recognized in the period during which time spots are aired 
all other revenues are recognized as services are provided 
the revenues realized from station barter arrangements are recorded as the programs are aired at the estimated fair value of the advertising airtime given in exchange for the program rights 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from extending credit to our customers that are unable to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  a increase of the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december   would reduce net income available to common shareholders by approximately million 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to televise programming over contract periods  which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally equal to or shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross cash contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
the programming rights are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value nrv 
estimated nrvs are based on management s expectation of future advertising revenue  net of sales commissions  to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using a four year accelerated method or a straight line method  depending on the length of the contract 
program contract costs estimated by management to be amortized within one year are classified as current assets 
payment of program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not reflected by adjustments for amortization or estimated nrv 
if our estimate of future advertising revenues declines  then additional write downs to nrv may be required 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  broadcast licenses  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operating performance of our stations and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
we have determined our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires such assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis along with our goodwill 
we test our broadcast licenses and goodwill by estimating the fair market value of these assets for each of our markets using a combination of quoted market prices  observed earnings multiples paid for comparable television station  discounted cash flow models and appraisals 
we then compare the estimated fair market value to the book value of these assets to determine if an impairment exists 
our discounted cash flow model is based on our judgment of future market conditions within each designated marketing area  as well as discount rates that would be used by market participants in an arms length transaction 
future events could cause us to conclude that market conditions have declined or discount rates have increased to the extent that our broadcast licenses and or goodwill could be impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets relating to various federal and state net operating losses nol that are carried forward based on the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary book tax basis differences  alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income 
as of december   valuation allowances have been provided for a substantial amount of our available federal and state nols 
although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets  we believe that it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  or if there is a material change in our projected taxable income or if there is a change in our ability to use nol carryforwards due to changes in federal and state laws  we will make any necessary adjustments to the valuation allowance 
this may result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows 
management periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions and accrues amounts for tax contingencies 
based on these reviews  the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations  reserves are adjusted as necessary 
the resolution of audits is unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than that which has been provided by us 
we believe our reserves are adequate 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r as a revision to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas r on january  and we will use the modified prospective transition to account for future share based payments 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
this standard requires that all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  be recognized in the income statement as compensation expense based on their fair values 
on april   we accelerated the vesting of  stock options  which were all of our outstanding unvested options at that time 
we accelerated the vesting of these options to prevent recognizing an expense of approximately million pre tax in future periods in accordance with sfas r 
the acceleration of the vesting effectively resulted in a modification to the original options 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock based compensation  we recorded an immaterial compensation charge based on the intrinsic value of the awards as measured on the modification date 
sfas r will require us to recognize a compensation charge for our employee stock purchase plan 
for the years ended december   and  we estimate that this amount would have been million  million and million  respectively 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and we adopted it upon issuance 
fin provides that an asset retirement obligation is conditional when either the timing and or method of settling the obligation is conditioned on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf 
eitf addresses the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of the lease 
eitf was effective for reporting periods beginning after july  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows 
results of operations in general  this discussion is related to the results of our continuing operations  except for discussions regarding our cash flows which also include the results of our discontinued operations

additionally  any references to the first  second  third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended march  june  september and december  respectively  for the year being discussed 
broadcast revenues set forth below are the principal types of broadcast revenues from continuing operations received by our stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution of each type to our total gross broadcast revenues in millions years ended december  local regional advertising national advertising political advertising network compensation retransmission fee revenue a other station revenues gross broadcast revenues less agency commissions net broadcast revenues revenues realized from station barter arrangements other operating divisions revenues total revenues a retransmission fee revenue includes a one time adjustment of million 
our primary types of programming and their approximate percentages of net broadcast revenues from continuing operations were syndicated programming  network programming  news  direct advertising programming  sports programming  children s programming and other programming 
similarly  our five largest categories of advertising and their approximate percentages of net broadcast revenues were automotive  professional services  paid programming including religious programming  fast food and retail department stores 
other than schools  no other advertising category accounted for more than of our broadcast revenues in along with the industry  we have seen softness in the auto advertising category and we expect this to continue in no individual advertiser accounted for more than of our consolidated net broadcast revenues in the following table presents our time sales revenue from continuing operations  net of agency commissions  by network affiliates for the past three years in millions of stations percent of sales net time sales a percent change b vs

fox c wb d c abc upn d cbs c ind d e nbc total c a during  several of our stations switched affiliates 
we have restated the revenue from those stations in prior years for comparability

c during  we entered into agreements to sell our cbs station in sacramento  california and our wb station in kansas city  missouri 
during  we entered into an agreement to sell our fox station in tri cities  tennessee 
the time sales from these stations are not included in this table because they are accounted for as time sales from discontinued operations 
d in the fall of  our composition of network affiliates will change as a result of our recent agreement to air mynetworktv programming and the recent announcements about the merger of upn and the wb into a network to be called the cw

local revenues non political political total local national revenues non political political total national other revenues total broadcasting revenues net broadcast revenues 
from a revenue category standpoint  the year ended december   when compared to  was negatively impacted by a decrease of advertising revenues generated from the political  automotive  movies  telecommunications and food breakfast sectors  offset by increases in the services  schools and entertainment sectors 
automotive  our single largest category  representing of the year s net time sales  was down political revenues 
both local and national political revenues were the primary drivers of higher revenue in  compared to because was a presidential election year 
in fact  we own television stations in of the so called battleground states including multiple stations in ohio  florida and west virginia 
we expect political revenues to increase in from levels  but not to the extent of political revenues from since is not a presidential election year 
local revenues 
our revenues from local advertisers  excluding political revenues  increased during the year ended december  when compared to we continue to focus on increasing local advertising revenues through innovative sales and marketing strategies in our markets 
revenues from our new business initiatives increased by million during the year ended december  to million from million during we expect to continue our focus on new business revenues in additionally  during  we implemented an enhanced sales training course for all of our salespeople with a focus on local revenue sales 
we have continued these efforts throughout and will continue these efforts in national revenues 
our revenues from national advertisers  excluding political revenues  have continued to trend downward over time 
we believe this trend represents a shift in the way national advertising dollars are being spent and we believe it has recently begun accelerating 
advertisers in major categories like automotive  soft drink and packaged goods are shifting significant portions of their advertising budgets away from spot television into non traditional media  in store promotions and product placement in network shows 
we expect this trend to continue into other revenues and expenses 
our other revenues consist primarily of network compensation  revenues from retransmission agreements with cable and satellite providers  production revenues and revenues from our outsourcing agreements 
compared to  other revenues increased million during the year ended december  the increase in other revenues is primarily related to increased retransmission revenues which increased million in  excluding a one time adjustment of million 
we expect to experience similar growth in our retransmission revenues in we expect this growth to be partially offset by a reduction in our network compensation  although we cannot predict the extent of this reduction in light of the recent cw network merger announcement 
expense discussion and analysis the following table presents our significant expense categories for the three years ended december   and in millions percent change vs 
vs 
station production expenses station selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of program contract costs depreciation of property and equipment corporate general and administrative expenses amortization of definite lived intangible assets interest expense unrealized gain from derivative instruments gain on insurance settlement impairment of goodwill income tax provision station production expenses 
station production expenses decreased during the year ended december  compared to primarily due to decreases in costs related to lmas and outsourcing agreements of million 
in addition  there were also decreases in promotion expense due to cutbacks in promotional plans amounting to million  news costs of million  programming expenses of million  production expenses of million  music license fees of million and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
these decreases were offset by increases in engineering expenses of million  rating service fees of million  salary expense of million and fox inventory costs of million 
we do not expect similar decreases in costs related to existing lmas and outsourcing agreements in future periods and we expect a increase in total station production expense in station production costs increased in compared to as a result of news expense related to commencement of news central during in the greensboro  north carolina  milwaukee  wisconsin  tampa  florida  birmingham  alabama  las vegas  nevada and cincinnati  ohio markets of million  an increase in rating service fees of million  engineering expense of million  promotion expense of and other miscellaneous decreases of million  offset by a decrease in costs related to lmas and outsourcing agreements of million and programming expense of million 
station selling  general and administrative expenses 
station selling  general and administrative expense decreased during the year ended december  compared to as a result of decreases in sales expenses related to direct mailers of million  local and national sales representatives commissions of million  salary expense of million  workers compensation refunds of million  expenses related to an annual sales trip of million  bad debt expenses of million and electric expenses of million 
these decreases were offset by a one time adjustment of million to our self insured healthcare plan during the third quarter of  increases in expense for cunningham broadcasting corporation  a related party entity that we consolidate  of million and vacation expense of million 
we expect station selling  general and administrative expenses to increase about in in  we had an increase in sales and other expense related to our direct mail initiative of million  an increase in bad debt expense of million  an increase in vacation  salary and payroll taxes of million  an increase in local and national sales representatives commissions of million  an increase in insurance costs of million  an increase in trade expense of million  an increase in building rent and related expenses of million and miscellaneous increases of million compared to amortization of program contract costs 
the amortization of our programming costs has trended significantly downward since this is primarily because the costs to acquire syndicated programming had been declining 
we do not expect this trend to continue and we expect program contract amortization to return to levels during depreciation of property and equipment 
the depreciation of property and equipment has been increasing since these increases are primarily related to capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  as we have been completing the final phase of our digital build out 
additionally  during  a million impairment was recognized for certain capitalized software costs that became obsolete as a result of our conversion to a new revenue billing system during the second quarter of we expect to spend million in capital expenditures in and we expect depreciation expense to remain stable 
corporate general and administrative expenses 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent the costs to operate our corporate headquarters location 
such costs include  among other things  corporate departmental salaries  bonuses and fringe benefits  directors and officers life insurance  rent  telephone  consulting fees  legal  accounting and director fees 
corporate departments include executive  treasury  finance and accounting  human resources  technology  corporate relations  legal  sales  operations and purchasing 
corporate general and administrative expenses decreased during the year ended december  compared to as a result of decreases in salary and training expense related to open positions of million  consulting fees of million  sales promotion of million and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
these decreases were offset by an increase in expense of million related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as the million increase related to our charitable contributions to the sinclair relief fund  a related party charitable organization established in response to the disaster caused by hurricane katrina 
we expect corporate overhead expenses to increase to million in during the year ended december   corporate general and administrative expenses increased by million from due to increases in salary expense of million  training and education expenses of million  corporate relation costs of million and a million increase related to legal fees 
these were offset by decreases in consulting fees of million and other miscellaneous decreases of million 
amortization of definite lived intangible assets 
the amortization of definite lived intangibles has trended slightly downward since and we expect this trend to continue in amortization is decreasing slightly over time because a portion of our intangible assets becomes fully amortized each year 
interest expense 
interest expense presented in the financial statements is related to continuing operations 
interest expense decreased million during the year ended december  when compared to this decrease is related to the use of proceeds from television station sales to repay debt during  partially offset by rising interest rates on our floating rate debt and by the exchange of our convertible preferred stock for convertible debentures  which increased interest expense 
we expect interest expense to decrease in  assuming no changes in the current interest rate yield curve and no changes in our current debt levels 
interest expense decreased in by million as a result of the refinancing we did in the second quarter in an effort to reduce our overall interest costs 
derivative instruments 
we record gains and losses related to certain of our derivative instruments 
we entered into these instruments prior to implementing the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and due to the way they were structured  they did not qualify as effective hedges as that term is defined in the accounting guidance 
generally  when derivative instruments are not effective  the change in the fair value of the instruments is recorded in the statement of earnings for each year 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is primarily based on the future interest rate curves at the end of each year 
during the year ended december   the future interest rate curves reflected increasing interest rates and  therefore  we recorded an unrealized gain from derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations 
in and  the future interest rate curves also reflected increasing interest rates  resulting in an unrealized gain from derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations 
these derivative instruments expire on june   at which time  the fair value will equal zero 
therefore  during the first and second quarters of  the total net unrealized gain from these instruments will equal million 
gain on insurance settlement 
in the first quarter of  one of our towers in charleston  west virginia collapsed during a severe ice storm 
this tower was insured and we used the insurance proceeds to rebuild the tower and to replace the other assets that were destroyed by the collapse 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed substantially all of the construction of the new tower and placed it in service  and at that time we recognized a gain on insurance settlement of million 
in  we recognized a gain on insurance settlement of million related to rebuilding the tower and replacing the other assets that were destroyed by the collapse 
we do not expect any additional payments or gains related to this claim to occur in impairment of goodwill 
on a periodic basis  we test our goodwill for impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting rules 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
there was no impairment of goodwill to recognize in in  we recognized a loss of million related to an impairment of goodwill in one of our markets 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision for our pre tax income from continuing operations of million resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the income tax provision for our pre tax income from continuing operations of million resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to is primarily attributable to a one time loss of certain state net operating losses  net of applicable valuation allowances  resulting from a corporate restructuring  offset by the effect of an ohio tax law change 
we expect that the effective tax rate will be approximately in as of december   we have a net deferred tax liability of million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of million as of december  the increase in deferred taxes primarily relates to an increase in deferred tax liabilities associated with book and tax differences relating to the amortization of intangible assets and a decrease in deferred tax assets resulting from utilization of federal net operating losses to offset the gains on sale of several stations during other operating divisions revenue and expense during the year ended december   the other operating divisions revenue that related to g  our software development and consulting company increased by million to million or  from million for g s operating expenses increased by million to million for as compared to million for other operating divisions revenue related to our ownership interest in acrodyne increased by million to million or  from revenues of million in acrodyne s operating expenses increased by million to million for as compared to million for liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and availability under our bank credit agreement the bank credit agreement 
on may   we amended and restated the bank credit agreement  lowering our annual interest rate and outstanding balances 
the bank credit agreement  as in effect on december   includes a term loan a facility the term loan of million and a revolving credit facility the revolver of million maturing on december  and june   respectively 
scheduled payments on the term loan and revolver are calculated at the london interbank offered rate libor plus  with step downs tied to a leverage grid 
we have the right to terminate the term loan or revolver at any time without prepayment penalty 
the term loan is repayable in quarterly installments  amortizing as follows per quarter commencing march  to december per quarter commencing march  to december per quarter commencing march  and continuing through its maturity on december  availability under the revolver does not reduce incrementally and terminates at maturity 
we are required to repay the term loan and reduce the revolver with i of the net proceeds of any casualty loss or condemnation and ii of the net proceeds of any sale or other disposition of our assets in excess of million in the aggregate in any month period  to the extent not used to acquire new assets 
as of december   we had million in cash balances and negative working capital of approximately million 
we anticipate that cash flow from our operations and the revolver will be sufficient to continue paying dividends under our current policy and to satisfy our debt service obligations  capital expenditure requirements and working capital needs for the next year 
as of december   we had borrowed a million under our term loan and million under our revolver 
the remaining balance available under the revolver was million as of december  our ability to draw on our revolver is based on pro forma trailing cash flow levels as defined in our bank credit agreement 
for the year ended december   the entire million of current borrowing capacity was available under our revolver 
on april   we filed a million universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which will permit us to offer and sell various types of securities from time to time 
offered securities may include common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  depository shares or any combination thereof in amounts  prices and on terms to be announced when the securities are offered 
if we decide to offer any securities under our shelf registration  we intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to  the reduction  redemption or refinancing of debt or other obligations  acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital 
we have million of availability under this shelf registration  which expires on november  sources and uses of cash the following table sets forth our cash flows for the years ended december   and in millions net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows from used in investing activities capital expenditures station sales acquisitions sale of investments other net cash flows used in from financing activities issuance of debt repayment of debt dividend payments preferred stock redemption other operating activities net cash flows from operating activities decreased during compared to primarily as a result of television station sales during and the related cash tax payments as a result of the gains from the sales 
cash tax payments in were million as compared to million in cash tax payments in additionally  changes in our regular cash flows from operations resulted in net cash outflows of million in compared to net cash inflows of million in from similar operational changes 
interest payments decreased to million in compared to million in we expect to make million in interest payments in our program payments decreased to million in compared to million in we expect our program payments to continue to trend downwards in net cash flows from operating activities decreased during compared to primarily as a result of tax refunds of million received during most of these refunds were related to tax net operating losses from the tax return  which was filed in  that were carried back to offset gains on radio station sales in our interest payments were million in our program payments were million in investing activities net cash flows from investing activities increased significantly during compared to the net cash flows used in investing activities in the primary driver of this increase was cash from the sales of television stations of million and the sale of our investment in atlantic automotive for million 
the cash from station sales was offset by million cash paid related to the purchase options for wnab tv in nashville  tennessee and a cash payment of million related to the fcc license purchase option for wnys tv in syracuse  new york 
additionally  our cash payments for property and equipment decreased by million in  as compared to  primarily because we spent less on digital conversion costs 
for  we anticipate incurring approximately million of capital expenditures for station maintenance  equipment replacement and consolidation of building and tower needs in some markets 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under our bank credit agreement or an issuance of securities 
net cash flows used in investing activities decreased during compared to some of this decrease was related to cash from the sale of television stations of million in compared to million in cash paid in related to the purchase options of wnab 
additionally  our cash payments for property and equipment decreased by million in  as compared to  primarily because we spent less on digital conversion costs 
financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities increased significantly in compared to primarily because we utilized the cash from the sales of our television stations to repay debt

net cash flows used in financing activities increased in compared to primarily because our debt repayments to non affiliates and preferred securities redemption  net of debt issuance  were million in compared to million in additionally  we did not pay any dividends on our common stock in during  and  we paid million  million and million in dividends on our series d convertible preferred stock  respectively 
we will not incur these dividend payments in the future because we exchanged the convertible preferred stock for convertible debentures on june  for additional information  refer to note notes payable and commercial bank financing  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in may  we declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock for the first time in our company s history

the closing on the license assets is pending approval by the fcc 
we paid million of the license assets exercise price on december  if the fcc has not granted approval by december   we will be required to pay the remaining million to the unrelated third party 
we have determined that wnab continues to be a variable interest entity vie and that we remain the primary beneficiary of the variable interest as a result of the terms of our outsourcing agreement and our purchase option 
as a result  we continue to consolidate the assets and liabilities of wnab at their fair values  which have been adjusted to reflect an appraisal prepared in connection with the closing of the non license assets 
goodwill and fcc license book values were increased by million and million  respectively  upon the closing of the non license assets in may on may   we entered into a twelve month limited scope liquidity assurance with acrodyne communications  inc acrodyne  one of our majority owned subsidiaries

in connection with this liquidity assurance  we established a million line of credit for acrodyne 
interest on any unpaid indebtedness will be calculated on a daily basis at libor plus basis points per annum 
as of december   acrodyne had borrowed million under this line of credit 
we do not believe the liquidity assurance will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows and  therefore  we have not recorded any liability related to it

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we enter into derivative instruments primarily for the purpose of reducing the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt and to reduce the impact of changing fair market values on our fixed rate debt 
we account for derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
collectively  sfas 
for additional information on sfas  see note derivative instruments  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we held the following derivative instruments in millions pro forma fmv notional amount expiration date interest payable interest receivable fmv asset liability d rate increase e rate decrease e a june  to libor c a june  to libor c b march  libor c b march  libor c a these swap agreements do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas and  therefore  changes in their fair market values are reflected currently in earnings as an unrealized gain from derivative instruments 
we recorded an unrealized gain related to these instruments of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the instrument with a notional amount of million was amended on march   resulting in a removal of the termination option by the counterparty 
the instrument with a notional amount of million does not contain an option to terminate before it expires 
b these swaps are accounted for as hedges in accordance with sfas  therefore  changes in their fair market values are reflected as adjustments to the carrying value of the underlying debt being hedged 
c represents a floating rate based on three month london interbank offered rate libor 
d the fair market value fmv of the interest rate swap agreements is estimated by obtaining quotations from the international financial institutions party to each derivative contract 
the fair value is an estimate of the net amount that we would pay receive on december   if we cancelled the contracts or transferred them to other parties 
this amount was a liability of million on december  compared to a liability of million on december  this decrease in liability was a result of higher interest rates at the end of versus e represents the estimated pro forma fmv of each derivative instrument as of december  if current interest rates were higher by or lower by  which indicates the relative sensitivity of these instruments to changes in interest rates 
during may  we completed an issuance of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes 
under certain circumstances  we will pay contingent cash interest to the holder of the convertible notes during any six month period from january to july and from july to january  commencing with the six month period beginning january  the contingent interest feature is an embedded derivative which had a negligible fair value as of december  we are also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
as of december   we had senior subordinated notes totaling million and million and convertible senior bonds totaling million and million expiring in the years   and  respectively 
based on the quoted market price  the fair value of the notes and bonds was billion as of december  generally  the fair market value of the notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
we estimate that a increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the notes by million as of december  the estimates related to the increase or decrease of interest rates are based on assumptions for forecasted future interest rates 
the fair value of the notes and bonds was billion as of december  and at that time we estimated that a increase in prevailing interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of million in fair value 
this indicates that our exposure to risk from a change in interest rates has not materially changed since december
