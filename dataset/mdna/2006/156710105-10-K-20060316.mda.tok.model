table of contents the tables below show  for each of our four segments  our revenues from external customers and income before provision for income taxes in the periods indicated 
segment revenues from external customers in millions year ended december  advanced ceramic operations esk ceramics semicon associates thermo materials segment income before provision for taxes in millions year ended december  advanced ceramic operations esk ceramics semicon associates thermo materials we categorize our products into four market applications 
the table below shows the percentage contribution to our total sales of each market application in the different time periods 
year ended december  defense industrial automotive diesel commercial total the principal factors contributing to our recent growth in sales are increased demand by the us military for ceramic body armor that protects soldiers and our acquisition of esk ceramics in august the operations of esk ceramics have been consolidated with ours since september  after eliminating inter company sales  esk ceramics contributed million to our net sales during and million during recent military conflicts in iraq and afghanistan  as well as an increasingly unstable geopolitical climate and the heightened risk of international conflicts  have resulted in increased orders for our ceramic body armor in each year since we were awarded an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract by the us army in august with a maximum value of million 
through february  seven delivery orders totaling approximately million have been issued to us under this contract 
we have also received a number of other orders for ceramic body armor  not covered by the indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract  from the army and other branches of the us military 
based on our current backlog for ceramic body armor  we expect our shipments of ceramic body armor to be higher in fiscal year than in however  unless we receive additional orders under existing contracts or are successful in obtaining new contracts for ceramic body armor  our shipments of ceramic body armor will decline materially in from levels we expect to achieve in moreover  government contracts typically may be cancelled by the government at any time without penalty 
for the next several quarters  and perhaps longer  demand for ceramic body armor is likely to be the most significant factor affecting our sales 
although we believe that demand for ceramic body armor will continue for many years  the quantity and timing of government orders depends on a number of factors outside of our control  such as the amount of us defense budget 
table of contents appropriations and the level of international conflicts 
moreover  ceramic armor contracts generally are awarded in an open competitive bidding process 
therefore  our future level of sales of ceramic body armor will depend on our ability to successfully compete for and retain this business 
during the quarter ended march   the us military directed us to modify the specifications of the lightweight ceramic body armor that we had been manufacturing  from the version commonly referred to as sapi small arms protective insert  to a revised requirement commonly referred to as esapi enhanced small arms protective insert 
the revised requirement is more difficult to manufacture than the sapi version 
we have developed five new designs to meet the revised requirement  all of which have been approved by the government  and we intend to continue to develop additional  improved armor designs 
during the third and fourth quarters of  nearly all of the body armor we shipped consisted of our new designs that meet the revised requirement 
our esk ceramics subsidiary produces boron carbide powder  which serves as a starter ceramic powder in the manufacture of our lightweight ceramic body armor 
owning this source of our principal raw material  together with the recent and ongoing expansion of our manufacturing capacity for ceramic armor at our new lexington  kentucky plant and in our irvine  california facility  should allow us to fulfill current and anticipated demand for our ceramic body armor 
our order backlog was million as of december   and million as of december  orders for ceramic armor represented approximately million  or of the total backlog as of december   and approximately million  or of the total backlog as of december  we expect that substantially all of our order backlog as of december  will be shipped during our sales to customers located outside of the united states have varied in recent years  representing million  or of net sales in  million  or during and million  or in as a result of our acquisition of esk ceramics in august  our sales to customers located outside of the united states as a percentage of total sales increased substantially 
esk ceramics sales to customers located outside of the united states in the last four months of during which its operations were consolidated with ours  were million  or of the total million foreign sales  and million during  or of the total million foreign sales during we plan to increase our sales efforts in foreign countries  and our acquisition of esk ceramics will help us achieve this goal 
we currently have sales offices in germany  china  and england as well as commissioned independent sales representatives in other parts of europe and asia 
of our sales to customers located outside the united states  were denominated in us dollars during net sales 
our net sales consist primarily of revenues from the sale of products  which we recognize when the product is shipped to the customer 
cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales includes the cost of materials  direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead expenses 
our business requires us to maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead 
as a result  our gross profit  in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  is greatly impacted by our sales volume and the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
additionally  because many of our products are customized  we are frequently required to devote resources to sustaining engineering expenses  which we also include in cost of product sales and expense as incurred 
the cost of electricity comprises a significant portion of our cost of product sales 
in  we began expanding our high energy utilization silicon nitride manufacturing operations at our new facility in lexington  kentucky  where costs  particularly for electricity and occupancy  are lower than in california 
we have increased our manufacturing capacity for the production of body armor plates by adding two hot press lines at this new facility  and currently are in the process of installing one additional hot press line 
we chose this facility for the location of the hot press expansion for the same reasons lower cost of electricity and occupancy 
the cost of electricity for our manufacturing operations in the united states and europe was approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in  and approximately million  or as a percentage of cost of product sales in selling expenses 
our selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for direct sales and marketing employees  commissions for direct sales employees and for independent sales representatives  trade show expenses  rent for our sales offices  product literature  and travel and entertainment expenses 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  employee bonuses  which are computed quarterly and accrued in the quarter earned  professional service fees  rent for facilities and expenses for information technology 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  materials and supplies related to ongoing application engineering in response to customer requirements  and the research and development of new materials technology and products 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items from our financial statements for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  net sales cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses selling general and administration research and development income from operations other income expense income before provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the corresponding prior year period 
our advanced ceramic operations division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  an increase of million  or from the million in the prior year 
the primary reason for this improvement was the shipment of million of ceramic body and other armor components for defense customers  an increase of million  or from the million of net sales in the prior year 
this increase in net sales of armor was due to an increase in demand for lightweight body armor for military personnel  caused in part by the us army s change from sapi to e sapi armor plates 
net sales for our automotive diesel component product line  including cam rollers  were million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
the primary reason for this increase is that our customers are producing more heavy duty diesel truck engines 
however  we are aware that some of our customers are designing new engines that do not include our cam rollers and  as a result  our sales of cam rollers may decline when these engines are introduced starting in net sales of our orthodontic brackets product line were million  which was unchanged from the prior year 
our esk ceramics subsidiary had net sales for the year ended december  of million 
we completed the acquisition of esk ceramics on august  and began to consolidate its operations with ours as of september  esk ceramics contributed million to our net sales for the year ended december  our semicon associates division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million or  from the million in the prior year  also reflecting lower shipments of microwave and laser cathodes 
our thermo materials division had net sales for the year ended december  of million  a decrease of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
this decrease was due to several factors 
defense revenues decreased million  and sales of fused silica rollers decreased million  which were offset by an increase of million 
table of contents of crucibles sales  and an aggregate increase of million from sales of other product lines 
the decrease in sales of fused silica rollers was caused by severe price competition from chinese manufacturers who continued to reduce prices resulting in decreasing sales prices for our fused silica roller products 
gross profit 
our gross profit was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was the result of increased sales  particularly in sales of body armor  improved sales mix  higher operating leverage and a reduction in the cost of boron carbide  a key raw material used in the production of body armor  resulting from the acquisition of esk ceramics 
our advanced ceramic operations division posted gross profit of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the corresponding prior year period 
the reasons for the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales were consistent with those reasons described in the preceding paragraph for the year ended december  our esk ceramics subsidiary had a gross profit of million  equal to of net sales  for the year ended december  for comparative purposes  gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was the result of increased sales  particularly in sales of boron carbide  improved sales mix and higher operating leverage 
additionally  included in esk ceramics gross profit in the year ended december   are million of pre tax expenses related to the amortization of the backlog and expensing the step up of the inventory from the application of purchase accounting in connection with the acquisition 
our semicon associates division had gross profit of million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or from million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended december  was the result of increased productivity and reduced costs in the production of microwave cathodes and magnets 
our thermo materials division had gross profit of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or  compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
this decrease was due in part to a million decline in gross profit in our fused silica roller product line caused by severe price competition from chinese manufacturers 
selling expenses 
our selling expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year 
selling expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  esk ceramics contributed million  or of the million increase 
esk ceramics selling expenses currently are  and we expect them to continue to be  higher as a percentage of net sales than the other three divisions because esk ceramics sells in more foreign countries and has more customers 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  for the year ended december   esk ceramics contributed million  or of the increase 
increases in the number of employees and related personnel expenses primarily accounted for the remaining rise in general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses

research and development expenses  as a percentage of net sales  increased from for the year ended december  to of net sales for the year ended december  esk ceramics contributed million  or  of the increase in research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   expenses for the development of new armor designs contributed to a portion of the increase 

table of contents other income expense 
our net other expenses for the year ended december  was million  compared to net other income of million in the prior year 
the primary reason for the change was an increase in our interest expense  which was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
included in interest expense for the year ended december  was approximately million for the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs as we terminated our credit facility in december the increase in interest expense was also due to higher borrowing levels for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
we incurred debt to acquire esk ceramics in august the change in other income expense was also due to gains on currency transactions of million recognized in the year ended december  compared to gains from currency transactions of million in the year ended december  income before provision for income taxes 
our income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the million in the prior year 
our advanced ceramic operations division s income before provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior year

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparing these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements which begin on page f of this report 
in applying these policies  estimates and judgments affect the amounts at which accounts receivable and inventory and certain liabilities are recorded and the useful lives of property and equipment 
we apply our accounting policies on a consistent basis 
as circumstances change  they are considered in our estimates and judgments 
future changes in circumstances could result in changes in amounts at which assets and liabilities are recorded 
future changes could also affect the estimated useful levels of property and equipment  which could result in changes in depreciation expense  write offs or write downs of such assets 
sales recognition 
sales are recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered  and collection is reasonably assured 
management is required to make judgments about whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured 
we reduce revenue with reserves for estimated price concessions and sales returns 
allowances  which are recorded at the time revenue is recognized  in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  are based upon historical price concessions and sales returns 
we do not record a warranty reserve on the sale of our products 
for our largest product line  body armor  all of which is sold to the us government  each lot of body armor is tested at an independent laboratory and the lot cannot be released for shipment to the us government until positive test results are received by both the us government and us 
for our non body armor sales  we have experienced minimal claims from these types of sales 
additionally  due to the inherent nature  strength  durability and structural properties of ceramics  as well as a rigid quality control program that includes  for some of our customers  having the customer accept quality test results prior to shipment  we do not believe a warranty reserve is necessary 
accounts receivable 
we review our trade accounts receivables and our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of uncollectibility based on insolvency  disputes or other collection issues 
in addition  we routinely analyze the different aging categories and establish allowances based on the length of time receivables are past due based on contractual terms 
a write off will occur if the settlement of the account receivable is less than the carrying amount or we ultimately determine the balance will not be collected 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ materially from the amounts assumed in arriving at the allowance for doubtful accounts in the financial statements included in this report beginning on page f 
table of contents inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the write down of inventory for obsolete items is based on our estimate of the amount considered obsolete based on specific reviews of inventory items 
in estimating the allowance  we rely on our knowledge of the industry as well as our current inventory levels 
the amounts we will ultimately realize could differ from the estimated amounts 
inventory costs include the cost of material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flow over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flow discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other assets and liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date this statement is issued 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 as applicable  beginning in fiscal we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
in november  sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  was issued 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of fas provides guidance under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability 
the jobs act was enacted on october  fas states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement no 
we do not anticipate the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  as provided for in fas  we have not adjusted our tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
 which amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
defines a nonmonetary exchange as having commercial substance if the future cash flow of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  and shall be applied prospectively 
we adopted sfas no 
in the third quarter ended december   and its adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance and eliminates the alternative to use opinion s intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas no 
as originally issued 
under opinion  issuing stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
sfas no 
r requires all entities recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments eg stock options and restricted stock granted to employees 
this applies to all transactions involving the issuance of our own equity in exchange for goods or services  including employee services 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  all stock option awards to employees will be recognized as expense in the income statement  typically over any related vesting period 
sfas no 
r carried forward the guidance from sfas no 
for payment transactions with non employees 
the securities and exchange commission amended the compliance date on april   to require public companies to adopt the standard as of the beginning of the first annual period that begins after june  we will  therefore  be required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company anticipates adopting the modified prospective method and expects that the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on the company s operating expense of million for the year ended december  based on the outstanding unvested stock options at december  the company cannot estimate the impact of the company s operating expense of any additional stock options that may be granted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of high grade corporate and government securities with maturities of less than three years 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of stockholders equity 
average maturity of our investment portfolio is months  therefore  the movement of interest rates should not have a material impact on our balance sheet or income statement 
at any time  a significant increase decrease in interest rates will have an impact on the fair market value and interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical basis points and basis points adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve  which are representative of historical movements in the federal funds rate with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers our investment and is based on the weighted average maturity of our investments as of december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investment instruments of approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  similarly a hypothetical basis points adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our investments of approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  
table of contents actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuer of the securities may have the right to repurchase such securities 
we classify short term investments in current assets  as all such investments are available for current operations 
we are not exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt as it is fixed rate debt 
consequently  we do not utilize interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments regarding our debt 
foreign currency fluctuations we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management team to focus its attention on its core business operations 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges 
we measure the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
revenues  costs and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in stockholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income miscellaneous
