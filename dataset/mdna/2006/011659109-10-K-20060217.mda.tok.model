item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion of our fuel hedging activities 
while we do not currently anticipate a significant reduction in fuel availability  dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production  transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel 
in the event of significant hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas  there could be reductions in the production and or importation of crude oil and resulting price increases  which could adversely affect our business 
if there were major reductions in the availability of jet fuel  our business would be adversely affected 
mileage plan program all major airlines have developed frequent flyer programs as a way of increasing passenger loyalty 
alaska s mileage plan allows members to earn mileage by flying on alaska  horizon and other participating airlines  and by using the services of non airline partners  which include a credit card partner  a grocery store chain  a telephone company  hotels  and car rental agencies 
alaska is paid by non airline partners for the miles it credits to member accounts 
with advance notice  alaska has the ability to change the mileage plan terms  conditions  partners  mileage credits  and award levels or terminate the program 
mileage can be redeemed for free or discounted travel and for other travel industry awards 
upon accumulating the necessary mileage  members notify alaska of their award selection 
over of the free flight awards on alaska and horizon are subject to capacity controlled seating 
mileage plan accounts are generally deleted after three years of inactivity in that member s account 
as of december  and  alaska estimated that approximately million and million  respectively  round trip flight awards were eligible for redemption by mileage plan members who have mileage credits exceeding the  mile free round trip domestic ticket award threshold 
of those eligible awards  alaska estimated that approximately of those awards would ultimately be redeemed 
for the years   and  approximately   and  round trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on alaska and horizon 
those awards represent approximately   and for   and  respectively  of the total passenger miles flown on alaska and horizon 
for the years   and  approximately   and  respectively  round trip flight awards were redeemed and flown on airline partners 
for miles earned by flying on alaska and travel partners  the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards is recognized as a selling expense and accrued as a liability as miles are accumulated 
the incremental cost does not include a contribution to overhead  aircraft cost  or profit 
alaska also sells mileage credits to its non airline partners 
alaska defers a majority of the sales proceeds  and recognizes these proceeds as revenue when the award transportation is provided on alaska or another partner airline 
the deferred proceeds 
table of contents are recognized as passenger revenue for awards issued and flown on alaska or horizon and as other revenue net for awards issued and flown on other airlines 
at december  and  the deferred revenue and the total liability for providing free travel on alaska and horizon and for estimated payments to partner airlines was million and million  respectively  the majority of which is deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits 
revenue attributable to the mileage plan was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
other information seasonality and other factors our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year  because our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our operating income is generally lowest or loss the greatest during the first and fourth quarters due principally to lower traffic and sometimes due to adverse weather conditions  generally increases in the second quarter and generally reaches its highest level during the third quarter as a result of spring and summer vacation travel  including increased activity in the state of alaska 
in addition to passenger loads  factors that could cause our quarterly operating results to vary include changes in fuel  security and insurance costs  increases in personnel  marketing  aircraft ownership and other operating expenses to support our existing operation and anticipated growth  the timing and amount of maintenance expenditures  the timing and success of our growth plan as we increase flights in existing markets and enter new markets and pricing initiatives 
in addition  seasonal variations in traffic  the timing of various expenditures and weather affect our operating results from quarter to quarter 
many of our areas of operations experience inclement weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft  canceled flights and accommodating displaced passengers 
due to our geographic area of operations  we can be more susceptible to adverse weather conditions particularly in the state of alaska and in the pacific northwest than some of our competitors  who may be better able to spread weather related risks over larger route systems 
the results of operations in the air transportation business have also significantly fluctuated in the past in response to general economic conditions 
fare initiatives  fluctuations in fuel prices  labor actions and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern 
no material part of our business or that of our subsidiaries is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers 
consequently  the loss of our largest few customers would not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
insurance we carry insurance for passenger liability and property and aircraft damage in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice 
as a result of the events of september   aviation insurers have significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for third party liability for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events 
at the same time  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general 
although insurance rates have declined since that time  they are still somewhat above pre september levels and will likely remain there for the foreseeable future 

table of contents pursuant to authority granted in the air transportation safety and system stabilization act  the homeland security act of  as amended by the consolidated appropriations act   the government has offered  and we have accepted  war risk insurance to replace commercial war risk insurance through august  other government matters we have elected to participate in the civil reserve air fleet program  whereby we have agreed to make available to the federal government a certain number of aircraft in the event of a military call up 
the government would reimburse us for the use of such aircraft 
item a 
risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various uncertainties  such as global and industry instability  intense competition  volatile fuel prices  a largely unionized labor force  the need to finance large capital expenditures  government regulation  potential aircraft incidents and general economic conditions

item legal proceedings in may  the air line pilots association filed a lawsuit in federal district court in seattle to overturn the current labor contract covering alaska s pilots as established by an arbitrator  which was effective may  on july   alaska filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit 
on october   the district court granted alaska s motion to dismiss 
this matter is closed 
in march  alaska filed a lawsuit in federal district court in seattle against the international association of machinists iam seeking to compel arbitration of a dispute regarding the permissibility  under the collective bargaining agreement  of subcontracting of alaska s ramp service operation in seattle 
on may   the iam filed a counter claim against alaska alleging that alaska violated the railway labor act status quo and engaged in bad faith bargaining by  among other things  stating that it would subcontract the seattle ramp work if it could not reach agreement with the iam on an acceptable new labor contract 
on may   alaska subcontracted the ramp service operation in seattle  resulting in the immediate reduction of approximately employees represented by the iam 
shortly after this event  the iam filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to reverse the subcontracting by alaska 
that motion was heard and denied by a federal court judge on june  alaska filed a motion to dismiss the iam counterclaim 
the court dismissed the iam s status quo claim  and the bad faith bargaining claim to the extent it was based on the seattle ramp subcontracting as opposed to other conduct during the parties negotiations 
the court stated that the iam shall file an amended counterclaim by january   but the iam did not do so 
on february   the court entered an order directing the iam to show cause why its counterclaim should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute 
the iam submitted its response to the court s order to show cause on february   but the court has not yet issued a ruling on the matter

table of contents note a pursuant to item of regulation s k  we are providing disclosure of the reconciliation of reported non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a gaap basis 
the non gaap financial measures provide management the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without the cost of aircraft fuel including the gains and losses associated with our fuel hedging program where appropriate  the navigation fee refund  restructuring charges or adjustments thereto  and aircraft impairment charges 
because the cost and availability of aircraft fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control and we record changes in the fair value of our hedge portfolio in our income statement  it is our view that the measurement and monitoring of performance without fuel is important 
in addition  we believe the disclosure of financial performance without impairment and restructuring charges is useful to investors 
finally  these non gaap financial measures are also more comparable to financial measures reported to the department of transportation by other major network airlines

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policies are forward looking statements 
please consider our forward looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report s introductory cautionary note 
there can be no assurance that actual developments will be those anticipated by us 
actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of a number of factors  some of which we cannot predict or control 
for a discussion of our risk factors  see item a risk factors  beginning on page and risk factors beginning on page general alaska and horizon operate as airlines 
however  their business plans  competition  and economic risks differ substantially 
alaska is a major airline and principally serves destinations in the state of alaska and north south service between cities in the western us  canada and mexico 
alaska also provides east west service to cities  primarily from seattle 
it operates an all jet fleet  and its average passenger trip in was  miles 
horizon is a regional airline serving primarily the pacific northwest  northern california  and western canada 
it operates both jet and turboprop aircraft  and its average passenger trip in was miles 
year in review and current events improved revenue from industry wide fare increases  record load factors  and a increase in passenger traffic helped to define a positive story for  despite relatively flat capacity at alaska 
alaska s capacity was flat compared to the prior year due to actions taken in response to the operational difficulties described below 
horizon reported significant increases in passenger traffic  resulting in increased revenues  offset by slightly lower yield 
operating expenses per available seat mile increased at alaska to cents and at horizon to cents compared to although fuel prices dipped in the fourth quarter  fuel again hit record highs during and played a major part in the increase in unit costs 
at alaska  our unit costs excluding fuel  a navigation fee refund  restructuring and impairment charges increased to cents compared to this is primarily due to the capacity reduction during the summer and slightly higher non fuel operating costs 
compared to  horizon had a decrease in unit costs excluding fuel and impairment charges  coming in at cents 
overall  our operating results are positive considering the continued significant losses for the industry as a whole and several large carriers seeking bankruptcy protection in although revenues and pre tax income at alaska improved over the prior year  we faced operational difficulties during much of the year due to the combined effects of the labor and operational changes across our company during the result was operational performance that was well below our goal during much of the summer months 
however  we began to see improvement in on time arrivals and departures during much of september and october  although we again experienced seasonal declines in these metrics in the latter months of the year 
in order to improve our operational performance  we reduced our summer capacity from our original expectations through schedule reductions and the elimination of certain flights 
common stock offering in december  we completed an offering of million shares of our common stock  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting change effective january   we changed our method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls from the capitalize and amortize method to the direct expense method 
accordingly  effective january   we wrote off the net book value of our previously capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all aircraft in a charge totaling million pre tax million after tax 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further details 

table of contents restructuring charges in the first quarter of  we recorded asset impairment and rental charges of million related to our decision to terminate the lease at our oakland heavy maintenance base 
these charges are included in restructuring charges in the statements of operations 
as of december   there was no accrual remaining related to these charges 
during the second quarter of  we contracted out our seattle ramp operations to a third party 
this resulted in an immediate reduction of approximately employees 
we offered a severance package  substantially the same as the severance packages offered to other employees in late  to those affected by the subcontracting that included cash payments based on years of service  one year of medical coverage after the severance date and continued travel benefits for a period of time 
the labor group accepted the severance package in june and  as a result  we recorded a charge of million in the second quarter of offsetting these charges is a million adjustment related to changes in our estimated costs of medical coverage extended to impacted employees from current and prior restructuring efforts and a change in the number of employees affected since the original accruals were recorded  resulting in a net restructuring charge for the year of million million after tax 
the following table displays the activity and balance of the severance and related cost components of the company s restructuring accrual as of and for the year ended december  in millions accrual for severance and related costs balance at december  restructuring charges restructuring charge adjustments cash payments balance at december  labor costs and negotiations we executed new labor contracts with the alaska pilots  dispatchers and mechanics and with the horizon mechanics and dispatchers in through either the negotiation or arbitration process  as further described below despite ongoing negotiations  we were unable to reach a new agreement with the air line pilots association alpa and  therefore  pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement  submitted to binding arbitration during the first quarter of  the decision of which became effective on may  and becomes amendable on may  this agreement resulted in an average pilot wage reduction of 
during the second quarter of  we presented a contract offer to the international association of machinists iam  representing our ramp workers that was rejected by this work group 
we subcontracted our seattle ramp operations to a third party effective may  this resulted in an immediate reduction of approximately employees 
during the fourth quarter  alaska reached an agreement with the aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa resulting in a new four year contract covering alaska s approximately aircraft technicians 
this contract includes  among other items  a market based wage increase of approximately and a one time  bonus to each of the employees covered under the contract  which was paid in the fourth quarter of alaska also reached an agreement with the transport workers union twu in that resulted in a new five year contract covering alaska s dispatchers 

table of contents in october  horizon reached an agreement with the twu resulting in a new three year contract covering dispatchers at horizon 
during the fourth quarter of  horizon reached an agreement with amfa on a three year contract covering horizon s mechanics and fleet service agents 
we are pleased with the contracts that have been reached recently and we are continuing to negotiate with our other workgroups to reach agreement on contracts that would benefit both our employees and our shareholders 
none of the contract negotiations is at an impasse or has reached the day cooling off period required under the railway labor act that would trigger self help 
therefore  we currently believe the risk of a work stoppage is low 
mark to market fuel hedging gains beginning in the second quarter of  we lost the ability to defer  as a component of comprehensive income  recognition of any unrealized gain or loss on our fuel hedge contracts until the hedged fuel is consumed 
we lost this ability because the price correlation between crude oil  the commodity we use to hedge  and west coast jet fuel fell below required thresholds 
for more discussion  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the implications of this change are twofold first  our earnings are more volatile as we mark our entire hedge portfolio to market each quarter end and report the gain or loss in other non operating income or expense  even though the actual consumption will take place in a future period 
in times of rising fuel prices such as in  this will have the effect of increasing our reported net income or decreasing our reported net loss 
our mark to market gains recorded in for contracts that settle in future periods  net of the reclassification of previously recorded mark to market gains for settled hedges  were million million after tax 
second  to a large extent  the impact of our fuel hedge program will not be reflected in fuel expense 
in  we recorded gains from settled fuel hedges totaling million  but only million of that gain is reflected as an offset to fuel expense with the balance reported in other non operating income expense 
we have provided information on mark to market gains or losses  as well as calculations of our economic fuel cost per gallon on pages and we continue to believe that our fuel hedge program is an important part of our strategy to reduce our exposure to volatile fuel prices 
navigation fee refund in august  alaska recorded a net refund totaling million million after tax from the mexican government related to navigation fees paid in approximately million of the refund was recorded as a reduction to contracted services expenses and million was recorded as interest income 
this is compared to an million refund million after tax recorded during the third quarter of aircraft commitments on june   alaska airlines  inc entered into an aircraft purchase agreement with the boeing company to purchase b aircraft with deliveries beginning in january and continuing through april the purchase agreement includes options to purchase an additional aircraft with deliveries between july and april the order also includes rights to purchase an additional s under the same terms  except that purchase rights are not assigned specific delivery dates 
in december  of the purchase rights were converted to options with deliveries in and subsequent to year end  alaska converted one option and two purchase rights into firm orders for three additional b s to be delivered in and separate from the purchase agreement  alaska has negotiated operating lease agreements for two additional b aircraft to be delivered in late 
table of contents in october  horizon finalized an agreement to purchase bombardier q aircraft with delivery dates beginning in december and continuing through july this agreement  in part  replaced firm orders for seven crj aircraft that were to be delivered over the next several years 
this agreement also provides for an option to purchase up to an additional q aircraft 
in connection with the agreement  bombardier agreed to provide certain remarketing assistance for up to q aircraft currently leased by horizon for a fee as set forth in the agreement 
should horizon decide to sublease any or all of the q aircraft  it is reasonably likely that the sublease income  including any support from bombardier  would not be sufficient to cover our existing lease obligation and we would have an immediate recognition of the related loss on the sublease 
other events in october  alaska finalized a million variable rate  pre delivery payment facility to provide a portion of the pre delivery funding requirements of alaska s purchase of up to new boeing aircraft of which are firm orders under the current aircraft purchase agreement 
this facility will expire on august  and the interest rate is based on one month libor plus a specified margin 
any borrowings will be secured by the company s rights under the boeing purchase agreement 
we began daily non stop service from los angeles to mexico city in august and from seattle to dallas fort worth in september capacity outlook for  alaska and horizon expect capacity increases of approximately to and  respectively 
the expected capacity increase at alaska is due largely to the return of the full schedule and the introduction of new b aircraft in  with most of those coming later in the year 
horizon s expected capacity increase is due largely to the annualization of increasing capacity of the q fleet from to seats and to the four q aircraft that will be delivered in including two used qs to be delivered in february or march 
the addition of the aircraft deliveries in at both alaska and horizon will be used to increase frequency in our existing markets and  to a lesser degree  serve new markets 
alaska will continue to work toward operational excellence in to improve our on time performance  completion rates  baggage handling  and other important customer facing operational measures 
as part of this initiative  alaska will remain focused on improving the performance of the ramp services at the seattle tacoma international airport 

table of contents results of operations compared with our consolidated net loss for was million  or per diluted share  versus a consolidated net loss of million  or per diluted share  in our consolidated income loss before the accounting change for was million compared million in the results include certain items that impact the comparability of the years 
these items are discussed in the year in review and current events section beginning on page our results also include certain items that impact comparability  including severance charges of million million after tax  an impairment charge of million million after tax related primarily to our boeing c fleet  mark to market hedging gains  net of the reclassification of previously recorded mark to market gains for settled hedges  of million million after tax  and a navigation fee refund of million million after tax 
excluding those items  consolidated income before the accounting change would have been million in compared to million in the year over year improvement can be characterized by higher revenues  offset by slightly higher non fuel operating costs and significantly higher fuel costs 
financial and statistical data comparisons for alaska and horizon are shown on pages and  respectively 
on pages through  we have included a reconciliation of reported non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
alaska airlines revenues operating revenues increased million  or  during as compared to due to an increase in operating revenue per available seat mile rasm on relatively flat capacity 
the increase in rasm was driven by a increase in ticket yields that resulted from an increase in ticket prices designed to offset higher fuel prices  higher load factors  and higher freight  mail and other revenues 
the flat capacity is primarily a direct result of the reduction in our summer flight schedule that was announced in june  offset by the addition of three b aircraft during the year 
load factor increased percentage points to a record for  due primarily to an increase in passenger traffic 
the yield environment is currently strong 
in  yield improvement is expected to come from year over year increases in fares particularly in the first half of and  to a lesser extent  a new fee that will be charged to customers that book travel through our reservation call centers 
freight and mail revenues increased by million  or  compared to as a result of a mail contract we have in the state of alaska that began in the third quarter of and fuel surcharges added to our freight services during the third quarter of  offset by lower freight volumes 
other net revenues increased million  or  due largely to an increase in mileage plan revenues  resulting from higher award redemption on our partner airlines and an increase in cash receipts from miles sold  of which a portion is recognized immediately as other revenue and an increase in our revenues from service to dutch harbor  which is operated by a third party 
alaska airlines expenses in  total operating expenses increased million  or  compared to operating expenses per asm increased from cents in to cents in the increase in operating expenses is due largely to the significant increase in raw or into plane fuel costs and increases in aircraft maintenance  contracted services  landing fees and other rentals  and other  offset by declines in wages and benefits  food and beverage service  selling expenses  depreciation and amortization  restructuring charges  and the impairment charge in related to our boeing c fleet 
operating expenses per asm excluding fuel  the navigation fee refund  restructuring and impairment charges increased compared to our current estimates of costs per asm  excluding fuel for the first quarter and full year of  are cents and cents  respectively 

table of contents explanations of significant year over year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits decreased million  or  during compared to wages have been reduced by the following restructuring initiatives announced in late the reduction in pilot wages resulting from the new pilot contract that took effect in may during the second quarter of  we subcontracted our ramp services operation in seattle during  there were an average of  full time equivalents ftes  which is down by ftes from the average in a reduction in benefits costs due to the reduction in ftes and pension expense the year over year decline in wages and benefits was partially offset by the following a million increase in employee variable pay awards including profit sharing  operational performance rewards and performance based pay compared to a favorable million adjustment in related to the ultimate loss estimates for workers compensation overall  the reduction in wages and benefits costs are partially offset by increases in contracted services and maintenance expense due to the subcontracting of certain operations 
we expect to continue to see year over year declines in wages throughout  although to a lesser extent than in contracted services increased million  or  due largely to contracting out of the company s fleet service and ground support equipment and facility maintenance functions in the fourth quarter of  and the seattle ramp operations in may additionally  the navigation fee refund recorded in contracted services was million in compared to million in we expect that contracted services will increase in as we annualize the costs associated with the changes 
aircraft fuel increased million  or  due to a increase in the gaap fuel cost per gallon  offset by a decline in fuel gallons consumed 
during  alaska also realized million of gains from settled hedges  the majority of which are recorded in other non operating income expense 
the total gains from settled hedges represents of alaska s income before income taxes and the accounting change 
after including all gains from settled hedges recorded during the period  our economic  or net  fuel expense increased million  or  compared to our economic fuel cost per gallon increased over from to 
in the second quarter of  we entered into a fuel contract whereby the spread between crude oil prices and jet fuel prices is fixed for approximately one third of our fuel consumption through april this contract resulted in approximately million in savings for alaska during see page for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by alaska the economic cost per gallon  the cost per gallon on a gaap basis including hedging gains recorded in aircraft fuel and fuel cost per gallon excluding all hedging activities 
aircraft maintenance increased million  or  due largely to the performance of more airframe work and engine overhauls in compared to other factors causing the increase were our power by the hour maintenance agreement whereby we expense b engine maintenance on a flight hour basis  regardless of whether the work was actually performed during the period  the contracting out of related heavy maintenance to third parties  which resulted in a shift of costs from wages and benefits into aircraft maintenance  the change in our accounting policy regarding engine and airframe overhauls see note to our consolidated financial statements  as well as certain enhancements to aircraft interiors  systems and flight decks to assist with reliability improvement 
we expect maintenance costs to decline marginally in due to the timing of maintenance events and expected savings from process improvement initiatives 

table of contents aircraft rent increased million  or  due to the additional operating lease on a b that was delivered in march  offset by lower rates negotiated in on extended leases 
we expect aircraft rent to be slightly higher due to the addition of two new b aircraft in the fourth quarter of food and beverage service expense decreased million  or  due primarily to a reduction in the average cost per passenger meal  offset by higher transportation costs and an increase in the number of meals served resulting from our new mexico city and dallas flights 
selling expenses decreased million  or primarily due to a decline in the incentive payments to horizon for certain flying 
incentive payments to horizon are eliminated in consolidation 
excluding the intercompany payments  selling expenses increased by million as a result of higher codeshare fees and commissions resulting from the increase in revenues 
in  of air group ticket sales were made through traditional travel agents  compared to in in  of the ticket sales were made through alaska s internet web site compared to in depreciation and amortization decreased million  or 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the boeing c fleet  resulting in lower depreciation expense in future periods 
this is offset by the increased depreciation on two new owned aircraft delivered during we expect depreciation and amortization to increase in as we take delivery of several new b aircraft  the majority of which will be owned 
landing fees and other rentals increased million  or 
the increase reflects higher landing fee rates and increased rental costs  primarily in seattle  portland and los angeles  offset by fewer departures 
we expect landing fees and other rentals to be higher in as a result of higher departures and increased airport costs 
other expenses increased million  or  primarily reflecting increases in passenger remuneration  crew costs  supplies  and legal settlement costs  partly offset by lower insurance premiums 
additionally  in there were million in losses on disposal of assets compared to million in the current year 
we expect other expenses to decline slightly in due to lower insurance rates and passenger remuneration costs 
horizon air revenues in  operating revenues increased million  or compared to this increase is due largely to the increased capacity in both the horizon brand flying and contract flying for frontier airlines  which began in january  combined with the slight increase in operating revenues per available seat mile rasm 
the increase in rasm was primarily due to an increase in load factors  partially offset by a decline in ticket yields 
load factor increased percentage points to for  due primarily to the increase in passenger traffic outpacing the increase in capacity 
the increases in passenger traffic and capacity are primarily due to increased contract flying with frontier  the harmonization flying with alaska  the addition of one crj in and four additional seats on each of our qs 
contract flying with frontier represented approximately of passenger revenues and of capacity  during compared to and  respectively  in horizon air expenses operating expenses for increased million  or  compared to operating expenses per asm increased compared to operating expenses per asm excluding fuel and impairment charges decreased compared to our estimates of costs per asm excluding fuel for the first quarter and full year of are cents and cents  respectively 

table of contents explanations of significant year over year changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits increased million  or  reflecting a slight increase in the average number of employees and wages per employee  a new performance based incentive program for all employees  and the move to a new paid time off program resulting in a one time charge related to the transition 
contracted services increased million  or  due primarily to the increase in contract flying with alaska that results in higher payments to non horizon employees for ground handling services 
aircraft fuel increased million  or  due to a increase in the gaap fuel cost per gallon 
during  horizon also realized million of gains from settled hedges  the majority of which are recorded in other non operating income expense 
the total gains from settled hedges represents of horizon s pre tax income 
after including all gains from settled hedges recorded during the period  the economic  or net  fuel expense increased million  or  over our economic fuel cost per gallon increased from in to in see page for a table summarizing fuel cost per gallon realized by horizon the economic cost per gallon  the cost per gallon on a gaap basis including hedging gains recorded in aircraft fuel and fuel cost per gallon excluding all hedging activities 
aircraft maintenance expense increased million  or  primarily due to a higher number of engine overhauls and propeller work for the q fleet and fewer aircraft covered by warranty 
we expect maintenance expense to increase substantially in due to the timing of maintenance events and the increased number of aircraft that are exiting their warranty periods 
aircraft rent decreased million  or  primarily due to lower rents on extended leases  return of one aircraft on a short term lease and fewer leased engines 
selling expenses are up million  or  from due primarily to an increase in credit card and other commissions resulting from higher revenues 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  primarily due to the addition of one crj at the end of the first quarter of and a q in the third quarter of landing fees and other rentals increased million  or 
higher landing fees are a result of significant rate increases in several of our key airports  increased departures and new markets being served 
consolidated nonoperating income expense net nonoperating income was million in compared to million in interest income increased million due primarily to improved returns and a slightly larger average marketable securities portfolio in  offset by a larger interest payment in related to the navigation fee refund 
interest expense increased million due to interest rate increases on our variable rate debt and the changes to some of our variable rate debt agreements to slightly higher fixed rate agreements 
capitalized interest increased million from million in to million in this increase is due to the significant increase in deposits for future flight equipment resulting from our new aircraft purchase agreements for boeing and bombardier q aircraft 
fuel hedging gains include million in gains from fuel hedging contracts settled in compared to million in in addition  fuel hedging gains include net mark to market gains on unsettled hedge contracts  net of the reclassification of previously recorded mark to market gains for settled hedges  of million in and million in consolidated income tax expense benefit our consolidated effective income tax rate on pre tax income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change for was compared to an effective income tax rate of on a pre tax loss in due to 
table of contents the magnitude of nondeductible expense  such as employee per diem costs  relative to a marginal pre tax profit or loss  a relatively small change in pre tax results may cause a significant change in the effective tax rate

our consolidated operating loss for was million compared to a loss of million for our consolidated pre tax loss for was million compared to pre tax income of million for alaska airlines revenues operating revenues increased million  or  during as compared to the same period in the increase in revenues resulted from an increase in passenger traffic  offset by a decline in ticket yields 
for the year ended december   capacity increased as compared to the capacity increases are primarily due to the annualization and expansion of our transcontinental flying  including service from seattle to chicago and los angeles to reagan national in washington dc the traffic increase of outpaced the capacity increase of  resulting in an increase in load factor from to 
the decline in yield per passenger mile was a result of continued industry wide pricing pressure  particularly in the fourth quarter where yield declines were more substantial  dropping compared to the fourth quarter of freight and mail revenues increased million  or  because of a new mail contract we have in the state of alaska offset by lower freight revenues 
other net revenues increased million  or  due largely to revenues from service to dutch harbor  which is operated by a third party  that began in january of and higher mileage plan revenues 
alaska airlines expenses for the year ended december   total operating expenses increased million  or  as compared to the same period in operating expenses per asm increased from cents in to cents in the increase in operating expenses per asm is due largely to significant increase in fuel costs  our restructuring charges  the impairment charge related to our boeing fleet  higher wages and benefits  contracted services costs and landing fees and other rental costs offset by declines in selling expenses and the navigation fee recovery 
operating expense per asm excluding fuel  the navigation fee recovery  restructuring and impairment charges decreased to cents per asm compared to cents per asm in explanations of significant period over period changes in the components of operating expenses are as follows wages and benefits increased million  or  during approximately two thirds of the increase reflects higher pilot wages  substantially all of which were due to the wage rate increase in may wages were favorably impacted by the restructuring initiatives announced in august and september 
during  there were  ftes  which was down by approximately ftes from on a increase in capacity 
benefits costs were favorably impacted by a million reduction in workers compensation expense resulting from positive workers compensation claims experience at alaska and a related reduction to ultimate loss estimates recorded in december totaling million 
in total  benefits costs were flat year over year 

table of contents contracted services increased million  or  due largely to expenses associated with an agreement with penair to provide flight services to dutch harbor that began in january of  costs associated with a temporary charter contract and higher security costs  partially offset by million from the recovery in of disputed mexico navigation fees paid in and aircraft fuel increased million  or  due to a increase in the gaap fuel cost per gallon and a increase in fuel gallons consumed 
the increase in aircraft fuel expense is inclusive of million of gains from settled hedges 
during  alaska also realized million of hedge gains  which are recorded in other non operating income 
after including all hedge gains recorded during the year  our economic fuel expense increased million  or  over our economic fuel cost per gallon increased from cents to aircraft maintenance decreased million  or  due largely to fewer engine overhauls during and a change in the mix of heavy maintenance versus routine maintenance 
aircraft rent decreased million  or  due to lower rates on extended leases and fewer leased aircraft in compared to selling expenses decreased million  or  due to a decline in the incentive payments made to horizon offset by increases in booking fees  credit card fees  and commissions 
incentive payments to horizon are eliminated in consolidation 
in  of air group ticket sales were made through traditional travel agents  compared to in in  of the ticket sales were made through alaska s internet web site compared to in depreciation and amortization increased million  or  reflecting accelerated depreciation on the planned retirement of the boeing c fleet  an increase in depreciation resulting from one aircraft purchased in  and the full year depreciation on aircraft acquired in  and additional provisions for inventory obsolescence 
landing fees and other rentals increased million  or 
the higher rates primarily reflect higher joint use and exclusive rental fees at seattle  portland  los angeles and oakland  combined with modest volume growth 
other expense increased million  or  primarily reflecting a million increase in professional services costs  higher moving expenses associated with our restructuring initiatives  higher passenger remuneration costs  and supplies costs 
restructuring charges totaled million during this charge includes wages and other benefits that will be paid as a result of our restructuring initiatives announced in august and september of horizon air revenues for the year ended december   operating revenues increased million  or as compared to this increase is due largely to the increased traffic in our native network and our new contract flying for frontier airlines  which began january   partially offset by a decline in the incentive payments made by alaska to horizon 
incentive payments are eliminated in consolidation 
the arrangement with frontier provides for reimbursement of expected costs plus a base mark up and certain incentives 
however  since horizon is not responsible for many of the typical costs of operations such as fuel  landing fees  marketing costs and station labor and rents  revenue per asm  cost per asm and cost per asm excluding fuel for this flying is significantly lower than horizon s native network flying 
for the year ended december   capacity increased and traffic was up  compared to the same period in contract flying with frontier represented approximately of passenger revenues and of capacity  during passenger load factor increased percentage points to 
passenger yield decreased to cents  reflecting the inclusion of the frontier contract flying  the yield for which is 
table of contents significantly lower than native network flying  and a decline in incentive payments from alaska for feed traffic

after including all hedge gains recorded during the year  our economic fuel expense increased million  or  over our economic fuel cost per gallon increased from cents to cents 
aircraft maintenance expense increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in block hours  a higher number of routine maintenance activities and engine overhauls for the q fleet and fewer aircraft covered by warranty 
aircraft rent increased million  or  reflecting the annualization of aircraft added during and the addition of spare engines during landing fees and other rentals increased million  or 
higher landing fees are a result of higher rates associated with modest volume growth  an increase in airport fees and increased costs for security

consolidated income tax benefit our consolidated effective income tax benefit rate for was compared to an effective income tax expense rate of in due to the magnitude of nondeductible expenses  such as employee per diem costs  relative to pre tax profit or loss  a relatively small change in pre tax results can cause a significant change in the effective tax rate 

table of contents change in accounting policy effective january   we changed our method of accounting for major airframe and engine overhauls from the capitalize and amortize method to the direct expense method 
under the former method  these costs were capitalized and amortized to maintenance expense over the shorter of the life of the overhaul or the remaining lease term 
under the direct expense method  overhaul costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe that the direct expense method is preferable because it eliminates the judgment and estimation needed to determine overhaul versus repair allocations in maintenance activities 
additionally  our approved maintenance program for the majority of our airframes now focuses more on shorter  but more frequent  maintenance visits 
we also believe that the direct expense method is the predominant method used in the airline industry 
accordingly  effective january   we wrote off the net book value of our previously capitalized airframe and engine overhauls for all aircraft resulting in a charge of million pre tax million after tax 
we do not believe disclosing the effect of adopting the direct expense method on net income for provides meaningful information because of changes in our maintenance program  including the execution of a power by the hour engine maintenance agreement with a third party in late critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with our audit committee 
mileage plan our mileage plan loyalty program awards miles to member passengers who fly on alaska or horizon and our travel partners 
additionally  we sell miles to third parties  such as our credit card partner  for cash 
in either case  the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on alaska  horizon  or any of our alliance partners 
as long as the mileage plan is in existence  we have an obligation to provide this future travel  therefore  for awards earned by passengers who fly on alaska  horizon or our travel partners  we recognize a liability and the corresponding selling expense for this future obligation 
for miles sold to third parties  a majority of the sales proceeds are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when the award transportation is provided 
the deferred proceeds are recognized as passenger revenue when awards are issued and flown on alaska or horizon  and as other net revenue for awards issued and flown on other airlines 
at december   we had approximately billion miles outstanding  resulting in an aggregate liability of million 
the liability is computed based on several assumptions that require significant management judgment to estimate and formulate 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimates  therefore  an incorrect assumption impacts the amount and or timing of revenue recognition or mileage plan expenses 
the most significant assumptions in accounting for the mileage plan are described below 
the number of miles that will not be redeemed for travel members may not reach the mileage threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for travel 
therefore  based on the number of mileage plan accounts and the miles in the accounts  we estimate how many miles will never be used breakage  and do not record a liability for those miles 
our estimates of breakage consider activity in our members accounts  account balances  and other factors 
we believe our breakage assumptions are reasonable 
a hypothetical change in our 
table of contents estimate of breakage currently in the aggregate has approximately a million affect on the liability 
however  actual breakage could differ significantly from our estimates given the dynamic nature of the program and our inability to predict our members future behavior 
the number of miles used per award ie  free ticket we estimate how many miles will be used per award 
if actual miles used are more or less than estimated  we may need to adjust the liability and corresponding expense 
our estimates are based on the current requirements in our mileage plan program and historical redemptions on alaska  horizon or other airlines 
the costs that will be incurred to provide travel when the frequent flyer travels on his or her award ticket  incremental costs such as food  fuel and insurance are incurred to carry that passenger 
we estimate what these costs will be excluding any contribution to overhead and profit and accrue a liability 
if the passenger travels on another airline on an award ticket  we often must pay the other airline for carrying the passenger 
the other airline costs are based on negotiated agreements and are often substantially higher than the costs we would incur to carry that passenger 
we estimate how much we will pay to other airlines for future travel awards based on historical redemptions and settlements with other carriers and accrue a liability accordingly 
the costs actually incurred by us or paid to other airlines may be higher or lower than the costs that were estimated and accrued  and therefore we may need to adjust our liability and recognize a corresponding expense 
the number of awards redeemed for travel on alaska or horizon versus other airlines the cost for alaska or horizon to carry an award passenger is typically lower than the cost we will pay to other airlines 
we estimate the number of awards which will be redeemed on alaska or horizon versus other airlines and accrue the costs on this based on our estimate of historical redemption patterns 
if the number of awards redeemed on other airlines is higher or lower than estimated  we may need to adjust our liability and corresponding expense 
the rate at which we defer sales proceeds from sold miles we defer an amount that represents our estimate of the fair value of a free travel award by looking to the sales prices of comparable paid travel 
as fare levels change  our deferral rate changes  which may result in more or less recognition of cash proceeds in any given quarter 
we review mileage plan estimates each quarter  and change our assumptions if facts and circumstances indicate that a change is necessary 
any such change in assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position and results of operations 
pension plans we account for the defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas no 
is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we recognized expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires the use of a number of important assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
at december   the fair value of our qualified defined benefit pension plan assets totaled million 
we anticipate making a cash contribution of approximately million during 
table of contents pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
as of january   we estimate that the pension plan assets will generate a long term rate of return of 
this rate is slightly lower than the assumed rate of used for the pension expense  and was developed by evaluating input from consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
we regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance investments as considered appropriate 
this expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december  is based on an allocation of us and us equities and us fixed income securities 
decreasing the expected long term rate of return by from to would increase our estimated pension expense by approximately million 
pension liability and future pension expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
we discounted future pension obligations using a rate of and at december  and  respectively 
the discount rate is determined based on the current rates earned on high quality long term bonds 
decreasing the discount rate by from to would increase our accumulated benefit obligation at december  by approximately million and increase estimated pension expense by approximately million 
the defined benefit plan for management personnel was closed to new entrants in we are working to restructure the defined benefit plans for other labor groups 
any such change could impact future pension expense and pension liabilities 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict what these factors will be in the future 
subsequent to december   the financial accounting standards board began to work on an exposure draft that would require balance sheet recognition of the full unfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans for years ending after december  for us  this would be effective at december  this change in the accounting for pension and postretirement benefits will likely result in a significant charge to our accumulated other comprehensive income as we will be required to recognize the unfunded status based on the projected benefit obligation rather than the accumulated benefit obligation 
the exposure draft is expected in march long lived assets as of december   we had approximately billion of property and equipment and related assets 
in accounting for these long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  changes in fleet plans  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
factors indicating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived assets  management decisions regarding the future use of the assets  a significant change in the long lived assets condition  and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
as part of our simplification and unit cost reduction initiatives  we may seek to accelerate the retirement of our md fleet in the future 
although no decision has been made  we expect to look closely at this option during the first quarter of and discuss it with our board of directors 
if we make a decision to exit this fleet type  we would likely have to make substantial lease termination payments to lessors for our leased md aircraft and we believe that we would incur a loss upon disposal of our owned md aircraft as the carrying value of those aircraft exceeds the current market value 
this loss would be recognized as an impairment charge if and when any such decision is made 
the market value of md aircraft fluctuates and is highly dependent on factors out of our control  including the number of aircraft available in the market and fleet changes by other airlines and demand for those aircraft by other carriers 
as of december   our owned md s have a combined net book value of approximately million and we believe the current market value is in the range of million to million 

table of contents in and  due to volatile economic conditions and indications of declining aircraft market values  we evaluated whether the book value of our aircraft was impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
no impairment was necessary based on the results of the evaluations except as related to the b c fleet and horizon s idle fokker f aircraft and spare engines in see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
there is inherent risk in estimating the future cash flows used in the impairment test 
if cash flows do not materialize as estimated  there is a risk the impairment charges recognized to date may be inaccurate  or further impairment charges may be necessary in the future 
workers compensation and employee health care accruals the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for workers compensation claims and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
our workers compensation and employee health care accruals totaled million at december   compared to million at december  realizability of deferred tax assets the company has a net deferred tax liability of million at december   which includes gross deferred tax assets of million offset by a gross deferred tax liability of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would be realizable and thus no valuation allowance has been recorded as of december  our conclusion is based on the expected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and does not rely on future taxable income 
should we incur additional losses in the future  our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to greater uncertainty 
we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period 
liquidity and capital resources the table below presents the major indicators of financial condition and liquidity

as of january   we no longer have capital expenditures related to overhauls as those maintenance activities are expensed as incurred under our maintenance accounting policy adopted on that date 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million of which million is expected to be new aircraft related in as we take delivery of several new aircraft 
cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million during compared to net cash used in financing activities of million during in the fourth quarter of  we issued million shares of our common stock for proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and professional fees 
horizon had one debt issuance during of million  which is secured by flight equipment and has a term of years 
alaska borrowed million against its pre delivery payment facility discussed below 
debt issuances and proceeds from common stock during the period were offset by normal long term debt payments of million 
we plan to meet our capital and operating commitments through internally generated funds from operations and cash and marketable securities on hand at december  totaling million  along with proceeds from our new pre delivery payment facility used to provide assistance with our pre delivery funding requirements on the purchase of new b aircraft  and additional debt financing 
we have debt financing arranged for all of our firm b deliveries and are currently negotiating the financing on the qs 
we also have restricted cash of million  which is intended to collateralize interest payments due through march on our million floating rate senior convertible notes due issued in bank line of credit facility alaska has a million variable rate credit facility that expires in march as of december   there are no outstanding borrowings on this credit facility and the company has no immediate plans to borrow using this credit facility 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
pre delivery payment facility on october   alaska finalized a million variable rate revolving loan facility with a syndicate of lenders to provide a portion of the pre delivery funding requirements of alaska s purchase of up to new boeing aircraft of which are firm orders under the current aircraft purchase agreement 
the facility will expire on august  the interest rate is based on one month libor plus a specified margin 
any borrowings will be secured by alaska s rights under the boeing purchase agreement 
the principal amounts outstanding on the facility relate to specified aircraft and will be repaid at the time that alaska takes delivery of the aircraft  likely using proceeds from long term debt financing on those aircraft 
we expect to fund additional pre delivery payments throughout and beyond using this facility

as noted in note of the consolidated financial statements  where these notes are discussed further  we have the option of calling the notes in march based on the recent market price of our common stock  it is possible that we would call the notes at that time 
however  no decision has been made 
if we do not call the notes  we have not yet determined how each payment of principal or interest due will be funded in the future 
we anticipate that these payments will be funded either by dividends  distributions  loans  advances or other payments from our subsidiaries or through new borrowings or financings by alaska air group 
any such payments by our subsidiaries to air group could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financing activities we received a million credit toward our purchase deposits related to the aircraft purchase agreement entered into during the second quarter of this credit was recorded as additional purchase deposits and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet and will be applied to future aircraft upon delivery

new accounting standards during the fourth quarter of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment an amendment of sfas nos 
and the new standard requires companies to recognize as expense the fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees as of the grant date 
this new standard will apply both to stock options that we grant to employees and to our employee stock purchase plan  which features a look back provision and allows employees to purchase stock at a discount 
our options are typically granted with ratable vesting provisions  and we intend to amortize compensation cost over the service period using the straight line method 
sfas r was effective january  we will use the modified prospective method upon adoption whereby previously awarded but unvested equity awards are accounted for in accordance with sfas r and prospective amounts are recognized in the income statement instead of simply being disclosed 
once adopted  we expect our stock based compensation expense  as measured under sfas r  will be approximately million to million per year on a pre tax basis  of which million to million will be for stock based compensation that has not historically been recorded in our statements of operations

effect of inflation and price changes inflation and price changes other than for aircraft fuel do not have a significant effect on our operating revenues  operating expenses and operating income 

table of contents risk factors if any of the following occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could also decline 
the airline industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines with greater financial resources or lower operating costs  or to adjust rapidly enough in the event the nature of competition in our markets changes 
the airline industry is highly competitive as to fares  flight frequency  frequent flyer benefits  routes and service 
the industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats 
recently  airlines have reduced routes and the number of planes available  which has resulted in reduced industry capacity and a trend towards increased fares 
if airlines decide to increase their capacity in the future  this could cause fares to decline  which may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we currently compete with one or more other airlines on substantially all of our routes 
many of these airlines are larger and have significantly greater financial resources and name recognition or lower operating costs than our company 
others are operating under bankruptcy court protection and may institute substantial fare discounts in order to maintain cash flows and enhance customer loyalty 
in addition  competitors who successfully reorganize out of bankruptcy could have lower operating costs derived from renegotiated labor  supply and financing agreements 
some of these competitors have chosen from time to time to add service  reduce their fares  or both  in our markets 
we may be unable to compete effectively against other airlines that introduce service or discounted fares in the markets that we serve 
the airline industry  particularly regional airlines  also faces competition from ground transportation alternatives  such as buses  trains or automobiles 
in addition  technology advancements may limit the desire for air travel 
for example  video teleconferencing and other methods of electronic communication may reduce the need for in person communication and add a new dimension of competition to the industry as business travelers seek lower cost substitutes for air travel 
in addition  the united states and mexico recently amended their bilateral agreement relating to commercial air service 
the amendments expand authorized service levels to cities we serve in mexico 
other airlines will likely seek to add service on some of the city pairs we currently serve  which will increase competition and potentially negatively affect our results of operations 
our business  financial condition  and results of operations are substantially exposed to the current high prices and variability of jet fuel 
further increases in jet fuel costs would harm our business 
fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses  comprising and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
significant increases in fuel costs during and have negatively impacted our results of operations 
further increases would harm our financial condition and results of operations 
based on historical trends  we estimate that a one cent increase in our economic price per gallon of fuel increases our fuel expenses by approximately million annually 
historically  fuel costs have been unpredictable and subject to wide price fluctuations based on geopolitical issues and supply and demand 
fuel availability is also subject to periods of market surplus and shortage and is affected by demand for both home heating oil and gasoline 
in addition  various events including natural disasters  such as hurricanes katrina and rita  and hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas or elsewhere  could result in reductions in the production or availability of crude oil or jet fuel and could result in increases in the cost of fuel 
because of the effect of any of these events on the price and availability of fuel  the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
in the event of a fuel supply shortage  higher fuel prices or the curtailment of scheduled service could result 
we may be unable to offset increases in the price of fuel through higher fares 

table of contents we utilize fuel hedges as a form of insurance against the volatility of fuel prices 
to manage the risk of fuel price increases  we have entered into swap agreements and purchased call options that cap our fuel costs at designated per barrel oil prices 
even with hedges  we are substantially and increasingly exposed to increases in jet fuel costs since the amount of hedged consumption declines and the price at which we are hedged increases 
this means that even if fuel prices stay at current levels  our economic fuel cost will increase in future years  harming our business and results of operations  unless we are able to offset these higher fuel prices through higher fares 
if we are unable to meet our cost reduction goals  our financial condition may suffer 
we  along with other airlines  have announced aggressive cost reduction goals that are an important part of our business strategy of offering the best value to passengers through competitive fares while at the same time achieving acceptable profit margins and return on capital 
we believe having a lower cost structure better positions us to be able to grow our business and take advantage of market opportunities 
for  our non fuel operating costs were slightly higher year over year  and we expect those costs to decline somewhat in if we are unable to further reduce our non fuel unit costs  we would likely not be able to achieve our growth plan and our financial results may suffer 
we have incurred operating losses in each year since and may incur operating losses in the future 
in addition  our quarterly results can fluctuate substantially 
in each year since  we have incurred operating losses 
for the year ended december   we incurred an operating loss of million  and prior to that we incurred operating losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
however  in  when considering the benefit from fuel hedges that settled during the period that are included in nonoperating income expense  we would have had an operating profit of million 
the inability to sustain profitability may hinder our ability to honor our existing obligations as they become due  to obtain future equity or debt financing or to do so on commercial terms  and to sustain and expand our business 
in addition  our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors including seasonal variations in traffic  the timing of various expenditures  and weather 
because expenses of an aircraft flight do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried  a relatively small change in the number of passengers or in pricing has a disproportionate effect on an airline s operating and financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue levels could cause a disproportionately negative impact on our results of operations 
due to these factors  as well as other risk factors described in this prospectus  quarter to quarter comparisons of our results may not be good indicators of our future performance 
in addition  it is possible that in any future quarter our operating results could be below expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our company 
in that event  the price of air group s common stock could decline  perhaps substantially 
our indebtedness and other fixed obligations could increase the volatility of earnings and otherwise restrict our activities 
we have and will continue to have for the foreseeable future a significant amount of indebtedness 
due to our high fixed costs  including aircraft lease commitments and debt service  a decrease in revenues results in a disproportionately greater decrease in earnings 
as of both december  and  we had approximately billion of indebtedness outstanding  approximately million and million of which was secured by flight equipment and real property 
in addition to long term debt  we have significant other fixed obligations under operating leases related to our aircraft  airport terminal space  other airport facilities and office space 
as of december   future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year were approximately million for through and an aggregate of billion for the years thereafter 

table of contents as of december   we had commitments totaling billion to purchase additional aircraft through we also had operating lease commitments for two aircraft to be delivered in we will incur additional debt and other fixed obligations as we take delivery of new aircraft and other equipment and if we are able to expand into new markets 
our outstanding indebtedness and other fixed obligations could have important consequences 
for example  they could limit our ability to obtain additional financing for funding our growth strategy  capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital or other purposes  require us to dedicate a material portion of our operating cash flow to fund lease payments and interest payments on indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  and limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including reacting to any economic slowdown in the airline industry 
our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other fixed obligations will depend on our future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn will depend on prevailing economic and political conditions and financial  competitive  regulatory  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due  and if we fail to do so our business could be harmed 
if we are unable to make payments on our debt and other fixed obligations  we could be forced to renegotiate those obligations or obtain additional equity or debt financing 
to the extent we finance our activities with additional debt  we may become subject to financial and other covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue our growth strategy 
we cannot assure you that our renegotiation efforts would be successful or timely or that we could refinance our obligations on acceptable terms  if at all 
we may not be able to obtain or secure financing for our new aircraft 
as of december   we had commitments to purchase new aircraft through we have secured financing for a portion of those aircraft 
to complete the purchase of the remaining aircraft  which we intend to do  to replace retiring aircraft and to grow our fleet  we must secure financing  which we may not be able to do on acceptable terms  or at all 
there can be no guarantee that additional financing will be available when required 
our inability to secure the financing could have a material adverse effect on our cash balances or result in delays in or our inability to take delivery of aircraft  which would impair our growth plans 
our failure to successfully implement alaska s growth strategy could harm our business 
alaska s growth strategy involves adding additional boeing aircraft  increasing the frequency of flights to markets we currently serve  expanding into new markets and increasing flight connection opportunities 
it is critical that we achieve our growth strategy in order for our business to attain economies of scale and to sustain or improve our results of operations 
we may need to obtain additional gates and other operational facilities at our key airports in order to increase the frequency of our flights to these airports 
increasing the number of markets we serve depends on our ability to access suitable airports located in our targeted geographic markets in a manner that is consistent with our cost strategy 
any condition that would deny  limit or delay our access to airports we serve or seek to serve in the future will constrain our ability to grow 
expansion will also require additional skilled personnel  equipment and facilities 
our inability to hire and retain skilled personnel or to secure the required equipment and facilities efficiently and cost effectively may negatively affect our ability to achieve our growth strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully expand our existing markets  establish new markets or increase our flight connection opportunities  and our failure to do so could harm our business 

table of contents growth of our fleet and expansion of our markets and services may also strain our existing management resources and systems to the point that they may no longer be adequate to support our operations  requiring us to make significant expenditures in these areas 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sufficiently develop our systems and infrastructure on a timely basis  and the failure to do so could harm our business 
a significant change to our fleet could negatively affect our financial performance 
alaska currently operates a fleet of boeing aircraft and md aircraft 
the md aircraft have an average age of nearly years  the longest of any of our fleet types with the exception of the b c aircraft  which are scheduled to be retired by the end of generally  older aircraft have higher maintenance costs  consume more fuel and have lower reliability and customer acceptance than newer aircraft 
in addition  having a mixed fleet of md and b aircraft adds operational complexity  results in higher crew and training costs  and drives the need for more inventory parts 
although no decision has been made  as part of our simplification and unit cost reduction initiatives  we may seek to accelerate the retirement of our md fleet in the future 
we expect to look closely at this option during the first quarter of and discuss it with our board of directors 
if we make a decision to exit this fleet type  we would likely have to make substantial lease termination payments to lessors of the leased md aircraft  which could negatively impact our financial performance 
in addition  we believe that we would incur a loss upon disposal of owned md aircraft as the carrying value of those aircraft exceeds the current market value 
this loss would be recognized as an impairment charge if and when any such decision is made and would thus have an adverse impact on our shareholders equity 
the market value of md aircraft fluctuates and is highly dependent on factors out of our control  including the number of aircraft available in the market and fleet changes by other airlines and demand for those aircraft by other carriers 
as of december   our owned md s have a combined net book value of approximately million 
if alaska fails to comply with financial covenants  some of its financing agreements may be terminated 
alaska is required to comply with specific financial covenants in certain agreements 
for example  on march   alaska entered into a million revolving credit facility  which contains certain restrictive financial covenants such as a minimum level of net worth covenant  a maximum level of debt and leases to net worth covenant  and a minimum level of fixed charge coverage covenant 
we cannot ensure that alaska will be able to comply with these covenants or provisions or that these requirements will not limit our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs 
alaska s inability to comply with the required financial covenants or provisions could result in default under these financing agreements and could result in a cross default under alaska s other financing agreements 
in the event of any such default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default  all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable 
if alaska did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that became due and payable  air group or alaska would have to seek additional debt or equity financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if such financing were not available  alaska would have to sell assets in order to obtain the funds required to make accelerated payments or risk its aircraft becoming subject to repossession  which could harm our business 
a downgrade in our corporate credit rating may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to make interest or principal payments on our outstanding debt 
in the past  air group s credit ratings were downgraded by both s p and moody s 
we cannot be assured that our corporate credit ratings will not decline in the future 
if any of our ratings decline  this may indicate a decline in our business and may affect the trading prices  if any  of our common stock or convertible notes and may make additional borrowing more expensive and difficult to obtain 

table of contents we depend on a few key markets to be successful our strategy is to focus on serving a few key markets  including seattle  portland  los angeles and anchorage 
a significant portion of our flights occurs to and from our seattle hub 
in  traffic to and from seattle accounted for of our total traffic 
we believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel  aircraft  and ground facilities  as well as to gain greater advantage from sales and marketing efforts in those regions 
as a result  we remain highly dependent on our key markets 
our business would be harmed by any circumstances causing a reduction in demand for air transportation in our key markets  such as adverse changes in local economic conditions  negative public perception about our product or significant price increases linked to increases in airport access costs and fees imposed on passengers 
an increase in competition in our key markets could also cause us to reduce fares or take other competitive measures that harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
weakness in the general economy  and in the airline industry in particular  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that airline traffic  including business traffic  is particularly sensitive to changes in economic growth and expectations 
low ticket yields and escalating fuel prices contributed to much of the airline industry suffering significant losses from through in addition  the war in iraq or other conflicts or events in the middle east or elsewhere may impact the economy and result in an adverse impact on the airline business 
similarly  an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or avian flu  could have a material adverse impact on the airline industry 
any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of these factors would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the september  terrorist attacks negatively impacted our industry and our business and further threatened or actual terrorist attacks  or other hostilities involving the us  may significantly harm our industry and our business in the future 
the terrorist attacks of september  and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry  including our company 
because a substantial portion of our costs are fixed in the short term  we were unable to offset the reduction in customer demand through cost savings  and operating results were harmed to a proportionately greater degree 
additional terrorist attacks  the fear of such attacks or other hostilities involving the us could have a further significant negative impact on the airline industry  including us  and could significantly reduce passenger traffic and yields due to a potentially dramatic drop in demand for air travel  increase security and insurance costs  make it more difficult for us to obtain war risk or other insurance  increase fuel costs and the volatility of fuel prices  increase costs from airport shutdowns  flight cancellations and delays resulting from security breaches and perceived safety threats  and result in a grounding of commercial air traffic by the faa 
the occurrence of any of these events would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our insurance costs dramatically increased immediately following the september  terrorist attacks and further increases in insurance costs would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
immediately following the september  terrorist attacks  aviation insurers dramatically increased airline insurance premiums and significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance available to airlines for third party claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events to million per event and in the aggregate 
in light of this development  under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act and the homeland security act of  as most recently amended by the consolidated appropriations act of  the government continues to offer domestic airlines either i third party liability war risk coverage above million  or ii in lieu of commercial war risk insurance  full hull  comprehensive and third party liability war risk coverage 
this coverage provides for the same limits of war and allied perils coverage for hull and comprehensive insurance and twice the limits of third party liability insurance carried by the airline on september  although our insurance costs have decreased since the dramatic increase following september   aviation insurers could increase their premiums again in the event of additional terrorist attacks  hijackings  airline accidents or other events adversely affecting the airline industry 
furthermore  the full hull  comprehensive and third party war risk insurance provided by the government is mandated through august  while the government may extend the deadline for when it will stop providing such coverage  we cannot be certain that any extension will occur  or if it does  how long the extension will last 
it is expected that  should the government stop providing such coverage to the airline industry  the premiums charged by aviation insurers for this coverage will be substantially higher than the premiums currently charged by the government and the coverage will be much more limited  including smaller aggregate limits and short cancellation periods ie days or  in the case of certain events  a lesser period  including immediate termination 
significant increases in insurance premiums would adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a failure to negotiate new agreements  or to do so on terms competitive with the labor costs and practices of our competitors  could disrupt our business and increase our costs 
as of december   labor unions represented approximately of alaska s and of horizon s employees 
labor costs generally are a significant component of our total expenses  comprising approximately and of our total operating expenses in and  respectively 
each of our different represented employee groups has separate collective bargaining agreements  and may make demands that would increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our profitability 
three of these agreements are currently subject to mediated negotiations through the national labor relations act process 
if we are unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of our employees or were to experience widespread employee dissatisfaction  we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages 
we could also become subject to protests or picketing by organized labor groups representing our employees 
any of these events would be disruptive to our operations and could harm our business 
in the event any agreement we reach with an organized labor group requires us to pay wages or to incur costs that are materially higher than those we currently pay or we are unable to fully offset such increased costs through fare increases  our expenses would increase and our operating margin would be harmed 
in addition  to the extent we are unable to maintain the outsourcing or subcontracting of certain services for our business  we would incur substantial costs  including costs associated with hiring new employees  in order to perform these services in house 
our continuing obligation to fund our traditional pension plans could negatively affect our ability to compete in the marketplace because some of our competitors have either eliminated such obligations through bankruptcy or never had traditional pension plans in place 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and our high labor costs or any increases to these costs could affect our ability to compete 

table of contents our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs 
we compete against the major us airlines and other businesses for labor in many highly skilled positions 
if we are unable to hire  train and retain qualified employees at a reasonable cost  or if we lose the services of key personnel we may be unable to grow or sustain our business and our operating results and business prospects could be harmed 
we may also have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who leave and  therefore  the loss of any of these individuals could harm our business 
our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of an airline accident or incident 
an accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could involve a significant loss of life and result in a loss of faith in our airlines by the flying public 
in addition  we could experience significant potential claims from injured passengers and surviving relatives  as well as costs for the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service 
although we believe that we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice  the amount of such coverage may not be adequate and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident 
substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our business and financial results 
moreover  any aircraft accident or incident  even if fully insured and even if it does not involve one of our airlines  could cause a public perception that our airlines or the equipment they fly is less safe or reliable than other transportation alternatives  which would harm our business 
we rely on third party vendors for certain critical activities 
we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business  including airframe and engine maintenance  ground handling  fueling  computer reservation system hosting and software maintenance 
as part of our cost control efforts  our reliance on outside vendors has recently increased and may continue to do so 
in september  alaska began subcontracting the remainder of its heavy aircraft maintenance to outside vendors 
in addition  alaska retained outside suppliers for fleet service and facilities maintenance 
in may  alaska subcontracted out its ground handling services at seattle tacoma airport to a vendor that provides similar services to alaska and other carriers at many other locations 
our increased use of outside vendors increases our exposure to several risks 
in the event that one or more vendors goes into bankruptcy  ceases operation or fails to perform as promised  replacement services may not be readily available at competitive rates  or at all 
although we monitor our vendors for quality control  if one of our vendors fails to perform adequately we may experience increased costs  delays  maintenance issues  safety issues or negative public perception of our airline 
in late and early  alaska experienced a number of negative press reports following several aircraft incidents in seattle 
the company has taken steps to increase supervision and training of vendor personnel in order to reduce the risk of further incidents and negative publicity 
vendor bankruptcies  unionization  regulatory compliance issues or significant changes in the competitive marketplace among suppliers could adversely affect vendor services or force alaska to renegotiate existing agreements on less favorable terms 
these events could result in disruptions in alaska s operations or increases in its cost structure 
our operations are often affected by factors beyond our control  including traffic congestion at airports  weather conditions and increased security measures  any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
like other airlines  our operations are subject to delays caused by factors beyond our control  including air traffic congestion at airports  adverse weather conditions and increased security measures  including measures imposed in response to security breaches 
delays frustrate passengers  reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs  all of which in turn affect our profitability 
during periods of fog  snow  rain  freezing rain  storms or other adverse weather conditions  flights may be canceled or significantly delayed 
due to our geographic area of operations  we believe a significant portion of our operation is more susceptible to adverse weather conditions than many of our competitors 
cancellations or delays due to weather conditions  traffic control problems and breaches in security could harm our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents increases in government taxes and fees could reduce demand for air travel and harm our business 
airlines pay or are responsible for collecting a number of different taxes and fees including  but not limited to  airport facility charges  immigration fees  security fees  excise taxes on ticket sales  and fuel taxes 
we believe the demand for air travel is highly sensitive to fare levels 
although law makers may impose additional fees and view them as pass through costs  we believe that a higher total ticket price in the eyes of the consumer will influence their purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic  which would harm our business 
moreover  we believe that the impact of higher fixed rate fees is proportionally greater for low fare carriers  carriers with a high percentage of leisure travelers  and carriers that fly relatively short segments 
because alaska carries many leisure travelers and horizon flies many short haul segments  we believe higher security fees and other fee increases generally could negatively impact air group more than some of our competitors 
changes in government regulation imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and disruptions 
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal requirements  both domestically and internationally  that involve significant compliance costs 
in the last several years  congress has passed laws  and the us department of transportation  the transportation security administration and the federal aviation administration the faa have issued regulations  relating to the maintenance and operation of airlines that have required significant expenditures 
for example  the faa has issued regulations covering  among other things  security measures  collision avoidance systems  noise abatement  environmental restrictions  safety procedures and maintenance regulations 
similarly  many aspects of an airline s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal  state and local laws protecting the environment 
additionally  because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since september   many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers 
additional laws  regulations  taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel 
if adopted  these measures could have the effect of raising ticket prices  reducing revenue and or increasing costs 
we rely heavily on automated systems to operate our business and any failure of these systems could harm our business 
we depend on automated systems to operate our business  including our computerized airline reservation system  our telecommunication systems and our website 
we also issue a substantial number of our tickets to passengers as electronic tickets 
we depend on our computerized reservation system to be able to issue  track and accept these electronic tickets 
in order for our operations to work efficiently  our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight information 
substantial or repeated website  reservations system or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of our services and cause our customers to purchase tickets from another airline 
in addition  we rely on other automated systems for crew scheduling  flight dispatch  and other operational needs 
any disruption in these systems could result in the loss of important data  increase our expenses and possibly cause us to temporarily cease our operations 
we rely on partner airlines for code share and frequent flyer marketing arrangements alaska and horizon are parties to marketing agreements with a number of domestic and international air carriers  or partners  including but not limited to american airlines  continental airlines  delta airlines and northwest airlines 
these agreements provide that certain flight segments operated by us are held out as partner codeshare flights and that certain partner flights are held out for sale as alaska codeshare flights 
in addition  the agreements generally provide that members of alaska s mileage plan program can earn miles on or redeem 
table of contents miles for partner flights and vice versa 
we receive a significant amount of revenue from flights sold under code share arrangements 
in addition  we believe that the frequent flyer arrangements are an important part of our mileage plan program 
the loss of a significant partner or certain partner flights could have a negative impact on our revenues or the attractiveness of our mileage plan  which we believe is a source of competitive advantage 
in september  both northwest and delta filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
either carrier could propose plans of reorganization that would seek to modify or terminate some or all of these agreements 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircrafts and parts 
alaska is dependent on boeing as its sole supplier for aircraft and many aircraft parts 
horizon is similarly dependent on bombardier 
as a result  we are more vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircrafts and parts  including design defects  mechanical problems  contractual performance by the manufacturers  or adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance or in actions by the faa resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft 
carriers that operate a more diversified fleet are better positioned than we are to manage such events 
horizon s results are partly dependent on frontier jetexpress  which is dependent on frontier airlines 
horizon operates regional jet service branded as frontier jetexpress under a year agreement with frontier airlines that began in january currently  this service represents approximately of horizon s total capacity and approximately of horizon s passenger revenue 
under the arrangement  frontier airlines pays horizon the expected costs of providing the service plus a base markup 
if frontier were to have financial difficulties and find it necessary to terminate the agreement  we would have significant excess capacity that we would have to deploy elsewhere 
there can be no assurance that this excess capacity could be deployed in profitable markets and our unit operating costs would likely increase 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have interest rate risk in our floating rate debt obligations and our available for sale marketable investment portfolio  and commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate our aircraft fleet 
we purchase the majority of our jet fuel at prevailing market prices  and seek to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy and other means 
we have market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge our exposure to jet fuel price increases 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
fuel prices we utilize derivative financial instruments as hedges to decrease our exposure to the volatility of jet fuel prices 
we believe there is risk in not hedging against the possibility of fuel price increases 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for a summary of our hedge positions 
we estimate that a increase or decrease in crude oil prices as of december  would increase and decrease the fair value of our hedging portfolio by approximately million and million  respectively 
please refer to pages and  as well as to note in the consolidated financial statements  for company specific data on the results of our fuel hedging program 
financial market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short term investment portfolio 
our debt obligations include variable rate instruments  which have exposure to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is somewhat mitigated through our variable rate 
table of contents investment portfolio 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates incurred on variable rate debt during would correspondingly change our net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately million 
in order to help mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations  we fixed the interest rates on several of our existing variable rate debt agreements in as a result  our variable rate debt is approximately of our total long term debt at december  compared to at december  we also have investments in marketable securities  which are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in  interest income would increase by approximately basis points
