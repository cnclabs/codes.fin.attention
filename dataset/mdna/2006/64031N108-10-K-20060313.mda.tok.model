because the majority of the company s derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 the derivative market value adjustment can cause the percentage of revenue and net income before taxes to fluctuate from period to period between segments 
for additional information on the company s segment reporting  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report 
significant drivers and trends the company s earnings and earnings growth are directly affected by the size of its portfolio of student loans  the interest rate characteristics of its portfolio  the costs associated with financing and managing its portfolio  and the costs associated with the origination and acquisition of the student loans in the portfolio 
in addition to the impact of growth of the company s student loan portfolio  the company s results of operations and financial condition may be materially affected by  among other things  changes in applicable laws and regulations that may affect the volume  terms  effective yields  or refinancing options of education loans  demand for education financing and competition within the student loan industry  the interest rate environment  funding spreads on the company s financing programs  and access to capital markets  and prepayment rates on student loans  including prepayments relating to loan consolidations 
the company s net interest income  or net interest earned on its student loan portfolio  is the primary source of the company s income and is primarily impacted by the size of the portfolio and the net yield of the assets in the portfolio 
the company s portfolio of ffelp loans generally earns interest at the higher of a variable rate based on the special allowance payment  or sap  formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
based upon provisions of the higher education act  and related interpretations by the department  loans financed prior to september  with tax exempt obligations originally issued prior to october  are entitled to receive special allowance payments equal to a minimum rate of return the floor 
in may  the company sought confirmation from the department regarding the treatment and recognition of special allowance payments as income based on the floor 
pending satisfactory resolution of this issue with the department  the company deferred recognition of the interest income that was generated by these loans in excess of income based upon the standard special allowance rate 
in june  after consideration of certain clarifying information received in connection with the guidance it had sought  including written and verbal communications with the department  the company concluded that the earnings process had been completed related to the special allowance payments on these loans and recognized million of interest income 
as of december   the amount of deferred excess interest income on these loans was million 
of the billion in loans held by the company as of december  that are receiving the floor  approximately billion in loans were refinanced prior to september  with proceeds of tax exempt obligations originally issued prior to october  and then subsequently refinanced with the proceeds of taxable obligations  without retiring the tax exempt obligations 
this billion student loan portfolio excludes billion of floor loans purchased from loanstar that were refinanced with taxable obligations 
interest income that is generated from this billion portfolio in excess of income based upon standard special allowance rates is referred to by the company as the special allowance yield adjustment 
since the billion portfolio of student loans will decrease as borrowers make payments on these loans  the special allowance yield adjustment will decrease as compared to historical periods 
in addition  if interest rates rise  floor income on this portfolio of loans will decrease  thereby reducing the special allowance yield adjustment 
interest income is also dependent upon the relative level of interest rates 
the current and future interest rate environment can and will affect interest earnings  net interest income  and net income 
the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility 
the company s management has structured all of its derivative instruments with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and thus the change in the market value on the derivative instruments is recognized in the statement of income each reporting period 
this mark to market adjustment may fluctuate from period to period and adversely impact earnings 
competition for the supply channel of education financing in the student loan industry has caused the cost of acquisition or loan premiums related to the company s student loan assets to increase 
in addition  the company has seen significant increases in consolidation loan activity and consolidation loan volume within the industry 
the increase in competition for consolidation loans has caused the company to be aggressive in its measures to protect and secure its existing portfolio through consolidation efforts 
the company will amortize its premiums paid on the purchase of student loans over the average useful life of the assets 
when the company s loans are consolidated  the company may accelerate recognition of unamortized premiums if the consolidated loan is considered a new loan 
the increase in premiums paid on student loans due to the increase in entrants and competition within the industry  coupled with the company s asset retention practices through consolidation efforts  have caused the company s yields to be reduced in recent periods due to the amortization of premiums  consolidation rebate fees  and the lower yields on consolidation loans 
if the percentage of consolidation loans continues to increase as a percentage of the company s overall loan portfolio  the company will continue to experience an increase in consolidation rebate fees and amortization costs and reduced yields 
see student loan portfolio student loan spread analysis 
although the company s short term yields may be reduced if this trend continues  the company will have been successful in protecting its assets and stabilizing its balance sheet for long term growth 
conversely  a reduction in consolidation of the company s own loans or the loans of third parties could positively impact the effect of amortization on the company s student loan yield from period to period 
also  as the company s portfolio of consolidation loans grows both in nominal dollars and as a percentage of the total portfolio  the impact of premium amortization as a percent of student loan yield should decrease 
however  due to increased competition in the student loan industry  this decrease may be offset by increased costs to acquire student loans through the company s various student loan channels and through certain portfolio and business combinations 
the company s core spread on its portfolio of student loans has decreased from in to in as discussed previously  this decrease is primarily due to an increase in lower yielding consolidation loans  an increase in the consolidation rebate fees  and rising interest rates which compress the margins on the company s fixed rate loans that are not hedged 
as a result of margin compression on its student loan portfolio and management s continued focus on growing and diversifying fee based revenue  business and asset acquisitions have remained a significant aspect of the company s strategy 
business and asset acquisitions management believes the company s business and asset acquisitions in recent years have enhanced its position as a vertically integrated industry leader and established a strong foundation for growth 
although the company s assets  loan portfolios  and fee based revenues increase through such transactions  a key aspect of each transaction is its impact on the company s prospective organic growth and the development of its integrated platform of services 
these acquisitions allow the company to expand the products and services delivered to customers and further diversify revenue and asset generation streams 
as a result of these acquisitions and the company s rapid organic growth  the period to period comparability of the company s results of operations may be difficult

net interest income the company generates the majority of its earnings from the spread  referred to as its student loan spread  between the yield the company receives on its student loan portfolio and the cost of funding these loans 
this spread income is reported on the company s statement of income as net interest income 
the amortization of loan premiums  including capitalized costs of origination  the consolidation loan rebate fee  and yield adjustments from borrower benefit programs  are netted against loan interest income on the company s statement of income 
the amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense on the company s statement of income 
the company s portfolio of ffelp loans generally earns interest at the higher of a variable rate based on the special allowance payment  or sap  formula set by the department and the borrower rate  which is fixed over a period of time 
the sap formula is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that is dependent upon when the loan was originated  the loan s repayment status  and funding sources for the loan 
depending on the type of student loan and when the loan was originated  the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to a market rate each july on those ffelp loans with fixed term borrower rates  primarily consolidation loans  the company earns interest at the greater of the borrower rate or a variable rate based on the sap formula 
since the company finances the majority of its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt  the company may earn excess spread on those loans with higher borrower interest rates for an extended period of time 
on most consolidation loans  the company must pay a per year rebate fee to the department 
those consolidation loans that have variable interest rates based on the sap formula earn an annual yield less than that of a stafford loan 
those consolidation loans that have fixed interest rates less than the sum of and the variable rate based on the sap formula also earn an annual yield less than that of a stafford loan 
as a result  as consolidation loans matching these criteria become a larger portion of the company s loan portfolio  there will be a lower yield on the company s loan portfolio in the short term 
however  due to the extended terms of consolidation loans  the company expects to earn the yield on these loans for a longer duration  making them beneficial to the company in the long term 
because the company generates the majority of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s balance sheet is very important to its operations 
the current and future interest rate environment can and will affect the company s interest earnings  net interest income  and net income 
the effects of changing interest rate environments are further outlined in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
investment interest income  which is a component of net interest income  includes income from unrestricted interest earning deposits and funds in the company s special purpose entities which are utilized for its asset backed securitizations 
provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is estimated and established through a provision charged to expense 
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectibility of the loan principal is unlikely 
recovery of amounts previously charged off is credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
the company analyzes the allowance separately for its federally insured loans and its non federally insured loans 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
the federal government currently guarantees of the principal of and the interest on federally insured student loans  which limits the company s loss exposure to of the outstanding balance of the company s federally insured portfolio 
in september  the company was re designated as an exceptional performer by the department in recognition of its exceptional level of performance in servicing ffelp loans 
as a result of this designation  the company receives reimbursement on all eligible ffelp default claims submitted for reimbursement during a month period june  through may  
only ffelp loans that are serviced by the company  as well as loans owned by the company and serviced by other service providers designated as exceptional performers by the department  are eligible for the reimbursement 
as of december   more than of the company s federally insured loans were serviced by providers designated as exceptional performers 
if the company or a third party servicer were to lose its exceptional performer designation  either by the department discontinuing the program or the company or third party servicer not meeting the required servicing standards or failing to get re designated during the annual application process  loans serviced by the company or such third party would become subject to the risk sharing for all claims submitted after loss of the designation 
one of the changes to the higher education act as a result of hera s enactment was to lower the guarantee rates on ffelp loans  including a decrease in insurance and reinsurance on portfolios receiving the benefit of the exceptional performance designation by  from to of principal and accrued interest effective july   and a decrease in insurance and reinsurance on portfolios not subject to the exceptional performance designation by  from to of principal and accrued interest effective for all loans first disbursed on and after july  
based on its current loan portfolio  the company estimates it will recognize a one time provision during of approximately million based upon the increased risk sharing of 
in addition  this change in legislation will have an ongoing impact on the company s provision for loan losses in future periods 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  months in repayment  delinquency status  type of program  and trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status and charges off the loan when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
other income the company also earns fees and generates income from other sources  including principally loan and guarantee servicing income  fee based income on borrower late fees  payment management activities  and direct marketing  and fees from providing software services

non gaap performance measures the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition to evaluating the company s gaap based financial information  management also evaluates the company on certain non gaap performance measures that the company refers to as base net income 
while base net income is not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company provides base net income as additional information regarding its financial results 
base net income  excluding certain special allowance yield adjustments and related hedging activity on the company s portfolio of student loans earning a minimum special allowance payment of  is used by management to develop the company s financial plans  track results  and establish corporate performance targets 
the following table provides a reconciliation of gaap net income to base net income and also reflects the impact of certain special allowance yield adjustments and related hedging activity related to the portfolio

b the special allowance yield adjustments are net of derivative settlements of million and million in and respectively  and the tax effect computed at 
base net income is a non gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the company s base net income presentation does not represent another comprehensive basis of accounting 
a more detailed discussion of the differences between gaap and base net income follows 
derivative market value adjustments base net income excludes the periodic unrealized gains and losses caused by the change in market value on those derivatives in which the company does not qualify for hedge accounting 
the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to reduce the economic effect of interest rate volatility 
derivative instruments that are primarily used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps and basis swaps 
management has structured all of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
amortization of intangible assets base net income excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles 
variable rate floor income loans that reset annually on july can generate excess spread income as compared to the rate based on the special allowance payment formula in declining interest rate environments 
this is referred to as variable rate floor income and is excluded in the company s base net income

these conduit programs mature in through  however  they must be renewed annually by underlying liquidity providers 
historically  the company has been able to renew its commercial paper conduit programs  including the underlying liquidity agreements  and therefore the company does not believe the renewal of these contracts present a significant risk to its liquidity 
the company is limited in the amounts of funds that can be transferred from its subsidiaries through intercompany loans  advances  or cash dividends

the period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due and relate to repayment loans  that is  receivables not charged off  and not in school  grace  deferment  or forbearance 
loans delinquent days or greater include loans in claim status  which are loans which have gone into default and have been submitted to the guaranty agency for ffelp loans  or the insurer for non federally insured loans  to process the claim for payment 
origination and acquisition the company s student loan portfolio increases through various channels  including originations through the direct channel and acquisitions through the branding partner channel  the forward flow channel  and spot purchases 
the company s portfolio also increases with the addition of portfolios acquired through portfolio and business acquisitions 
one of the company s primary objectives is to focus on originations through the direct channel and acquisitions through the branding partner and forward flow channels 
the company has extensive and growing relationships with many large financial and educational institutions that are active in the education finance industry 
loss of a relationship with an institution from which the company directly or indirectly acquires a significant volume of student loans could result in an adverse effect on the volume derived from its various channels 
the table below sets forth the activity of loans originated or acquired through each of the company s channels year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance    direct channel consolidation loan originations   less consolidation of existing portfolio   net consolidation loan originations   stafford plus loan originations    branding partner channel    forward flow channel    other channels    total channel acquisitions    loans acquired in portfolio and business acquisitions  repayments  claims  capitalized interest  and other  ending balance    student loan spread analysis the following table analyzes the student loan spread on the company s portfolio of student loans and represents the spread on assets earned in conjunction with the liabilities and derivative instruments used to fund the assets year ended december  student loan yield consolidation rebate fees premium and deferred origination costs amortization student loan net yield student loan cost of funds a student loan spread variable rate floor income special allowance yield adjustment  net of settlements on derivatives b core student loan spread average balance of student loans in thousands  average balance of debt outstanding in thousands  a the student loan cost of funds includes the effects of the net settlement costs on the company s derivative instruments 
b the special allowance yield adjustment  which was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  represents the impact on net spread had loans earned at statutorily defined rates under a taxable financing 
this special allowance yield adjustment has been reduced by net settlements on derivative instruments that were used to hedge this loan portfolio earning the excess yield  which was million and million in and  respectively 
the compression of the company s core student loan spread during has been primarily due to the following items an increase in lower yielding consolidation loans  an increase in consolidation rebate fees due to the growth of the company s consolidation loan portfolio  and rising interest rates which compressed the margins on the company s fixed rate loans that were not hedged 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are most critical that is  they are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below allowance for loan losses  student loan income  and purchase price accounting related to business and certain asset acquisitions 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses on student loans 
this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on its federally insured loan portfolio separately from its non federally insured loan portfolio 
the allowance for the federally insured loan portfolio is based on periodic evaluations of the company s loan portfolios considering past experience  trends in student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors  changes to federal student loan programs  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
through june   the federal government guarantees of principal and interest of federally insured student loans  which limits the company s loss exposure to of the outstanding balance of the company s federally insured portfolio 
in september  the company was re designated as an exceptional performer by the department in recognition of its exceptional level of performance in servicing ffelp loans 
as a result of this designation  the company receives reimbursement on all eligible ffelp default claims submitted for reimbursement during a month period june  through may  
the company is not subject to the risk sharing on eligible claims submitted during this month period 
only ffelp loans that are serviced by the company  as well as loans owned by the company and serviced by other service providers designated as exceptional performers by the department  are eligible for the reimbursement 
the company is entitled to receive this benefit as long as it and or its service providers continue to meet the required servicing standards published by the department 
compliance with such standards is assessed on a quarterly basis 
in addition  service providers must apply to the department for redesignation as an exceptional performer on an annual basis 
as of december   more than of the company s federally insured loans were serviced by providers designated as exceptional performers 
of this portion  the company serviced approximately and third parties serviced approximately 
if the company or a third party servicer were to lose its exceptional performer designation  either by the department discontinuing the program or the company or third party servicer not meeting the required servicing standards or failing to be re designated during the annual application process  loans serviced by the company or such third party would become subject to the risk sharing for all claims submitted after loss of the designation 
one of the changes to the higher education act as a result of hera s enactment was to lower the guarantee rates on ffelp loans  including a decrease in insurance and reinsurance on portfolios receiving the benefit of exceptional performance designation by  from to of principal and accrued interest effective july   and a decrease in insurance and reinsurance on portfolios not subject to the exceptional performance designation by  from to of principal and accrued interest effective for all loans first disbursed on and after july  
the company will recognize a provision in its allowance for loan losses based upon these new provisions during in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on the non federally insured loans  the company considers several factors including loans in repayment versus those in a nonpaying status  months in repayment  delinquency status  type of program  and trends in defaults in the portfolio based on company and industry data 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the level of the company s future provision for loan losses 
the company places a non federally insured loan on nonaccrual status and charges off the loan when the collection of principal and interest is days past due 
the allowance for federally insured and non federally insured loans is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because it requires estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
student loan income the company recognizes student loan income as earned  net of amortization of loan premiums and deferred origination costs 
loan income is recognized based upon the expected yield of the loan after giving effect to borrower utilization of incentives such as timely payments borrower benefits and other yield adjustments 
the estimate of the borrower benefits discount is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits 
for competitive purposes  the company frequently changes the borrower benefit programs in both amount and qualification factors 
these programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the borrower benefit discount 
loan premiums  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized over the estimated life of the loan in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for non refundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the most sensitive estimate for loan premiums  deferred origination costs  and borrower benefits is the estimate of the constant repayment rate cpr 
cpr is a variable in the life of loan estimate that measures the rate at which loans in a portfolio pay before their stated maturity 
the cpr is directly correlated to the average life of the portfolio 
cpr equals the percentage of loans that prepay annually as a percentage of the beginning of period balance 
a number of factors can affect the cpr estimate such as the rate of consolidation activity and default rates 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management would also change  which in turn would impact the amount of loan premium and deferred origination cost amortization recognized by the company in a particular period 
purchase price accounting related to business and certain asset acquisitions the company has completed several business and asset acquisitions which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by the company 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined and based on purchase price allocations 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
thereafter  the value of goodwill cannot be greater than the excess of fair value of the company s reportable unit over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities  based on the annual impairment test 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of the benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
due to the number of estimates involved related to the allocation of purchase price and determining the appropriate useful lives of intangible assets  management has identified purchase price accounting as a critical accounting policy

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure arises from fluctuations in its borrowing and lending rates  the spread between which could impact the company due to shifts in market interest rates 
because the company generates the majority of its earnings from its student loan spread  the interest sensitivity of the balance sheet is a key profitability driver 
the majority of student loans have variable rate characteristics in certain interest rate environments 
some of the student loans include fixed rate components depending upon the rate reset provisions  or  in the case of consolidation loans  are fixed at the weighted average interest rate of the underlying loans at the time of consolidation 
the following table sets forth the company s loan assets and debt instruments by rate characteristics as of december  as of december  dollars percent dollars percent dollars in thousands fixed rate loan assets   variable rate loan assets   total   fixed rate debt instruments   variable rate debt instruments   total   the following table shows the company s student loan assets currently earning at a fixed rate as of december  fixed interest rate range borrower lender weighted average yield estimated variable conversion rate a current balance of fixed rate assets dollars in thousands floor yield a the estimated variable conversion rate is the estimated short term interest rate at which loans would convert to variable rate 
historically  the company has followed a policy of funding the majority of its student loan portfolio with variable rate debt 
in a low interest rate environment  the ffelp loan portfolio yields excess income primarily due to the reduction in interest rates on the variable rate liabilities that fund student loans at a fixed borrower rate and also due to consolidation loans earning interest at a fixed rate to the borrower 
therefore  absent utilizing derivative instruments  in a low interest rate environment  a rise in interest rates will have an adverse effect on earnings 
in higher interest rate environments  where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and the fixed rate loans become variable rate and are effectively matched with variable rate debt  the impact of rate fluctuations is substantially reduced 
the company attempts to match the interest rate characteristics of pools of loan assets with debt instruments of substantially similar characteristics  particularly in rising interest rate environments 
due to the variability in duration of the company s assets and varying market conditions  the company does not attempt to perfectly match the interest rate characteristics of the entire loan portfolio with the underlying debt instruments 
the company has adopted a policy of periodically reviewing the mismatch related to the interest rate characteristics of its assets and liabilities and the company s outlook as to current and future market conditions 
based on those factors  the company will periodically use derivative instruments as part of its overall risk management strategy to manage risk arising from its fixed rate and variable rate financial instruments 
the total fixed rate student loan assets of billion held by the company at december   includes billion of loans refinanced prior to september  with proceeds of tax exempt obligations originally issued prior to october  and then subsequently refinanced with the proceeds of taxable obligations  without retiring the tax exempt obligations 
as discussed previously  interest income that is generated from this billion portfolio in excess of income based upon standard special allowance rates is referred to by the company as the special allowance yield adjustment 
the following table summarizes the derivative instruments used by the company as of december  to hedge this billion loan portfolio 
since the billion portfolio of student loans will decrease as principal payments are made on these loans  the company has structured the related derivatives to expire or amortize in a similar pattern

the company also has one basis swap with a notional amount of million that matures in august a basis swap is an interest rate swap agreement in which the company agrees to pay a floating rate in exchange for another floating rate  based upon different market indices 
the company has employed basis swaps to limit its sensitivity to dramatic fluctuations in the underlying indices used to price a portion of its variable rate assets and variable rate debt 
the company accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by sfas no 
are met 
management has structured all of the company s derivative transactions with the intent that each is economically effective 
however  the majority of the company s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 consequently  the change in fair value of these derivative instruments is included in the company s operating results 
changes or shifts in the forward yield curve can significantly impact the valuation of the company s derivatives 
accordingly  changes or shifts to the forward yield curve will impact the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company 
during  the company accounted for one interest rate swap with a notional amount of million as a cash flow hedge in accordance with sfas no 
gains and losses on the effective portion of this qualifying hedge were accumulated in other comprehensive income and reclassified to current period earnings over the period in which the stated hedged transactions impacted earnings 
ineffectiveness was recorded to earnings through interest expense

the effect on earnings was performed on the company s variable rate assets and liabilities 
the analysis includes the effects of the derivative instruments in existence during these periods 
as a result of the company s interest rate management activities  the company expects the change in pre tax net income resulting from basis point and basis point increases in interest rates will not result in a proportional decrease in net income

as a result of this acquisition  the company is exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us and canadian dollars 
the company has not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge this risk 
however  the company does not believe fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will have a significant effect on the financial position  results of operations  or cash flows of the company
