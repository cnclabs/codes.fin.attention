item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in risk factors under item a of this report and under the heading cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
business overview we  through our principal operating subsidiary  primus financial  are primarily engaged in selling credit protection against investment grade credit obligations of corporate and sovereign entities 
in exchange for a fixed quarterly premium  if a credit event occurs eg  bankruptcy  failure to pay or restructuring with respect to a reference entity upon which primus financial has sold credit protection  primus financial agrees to pay the notional amount of the credit swap contract to its counterparty in exchange for delivery of an unsecured credit obligation of that reference entity 
we seek to minimize the risk inherent in our credit swap portfolio by maintaining a high quality  highly diversified credit swap portfolio across reference entities  industries and countries 
primus financial has the highest counterparty credit ratings offered by s p aaa and moody s aaa and is managed by an experienced team of professionals who have expertise in credit analysis  investing  risk management and market analysis 
primus asset management manages the credit swap portfolios of primus financial and third parties 
for such services  primus asset management receives a management fee 
primus re operates as a financial guaranty insurance company  and generates revenue by charging a higher insurance premium for protection sold than the premium it pays for the offsetting protection it purchases 
credit swap revenues net credit swap revenue in our consolidated statements of operations  comprises the premiums earned and premium expense on credit swaps  gains or losses realized as a result of the termination of credit swaps and changes in the fair value of our credit swaps 
in our experience  considerable fluctuations may occur in the fair values of credit swaps from period to period and  as a result  the reader of our financial statements should not infer future results from historical net credit swap revenues or losses 
we receive premium income from the credit swaps we sell 
in general  premiums are received quarterly in arrears and are accrued daily into income 
in accordance with us gaap  we carry our credit swaps on our balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio are included as a component of net credit swap revenue loss in our consolidated income statement 
if a credit swap has an increase in fair value during a period  the increase will add to our net credit swap revenues for that period 
conversely  if a credit swap has a decline in fair value during the period  the decline will subtract from our net credit swap revenues for that period 
changes in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio are a function of the notional amount and composition of the portfolio and prevailing market credit swap premiums for comparable credit swaps 
in general  the fair values of individual credit swaps are aggregated by counterparty for presentation in our statement of condition 
if the aggregate total of fair values for a counterparty is a net gain  the total is recorded as a component of unrealized gains on credit swaps  at fair value in our statement of condition 
if the aggregate total of fair values for a counterparty is a net loss  the total is recorded as a component of unrealized losses on credit swaps  at fair value in our statement of condition 
aggregation by counterparty is applied where an executed isda master agreement is in place with the counterparty 
in instances where we do not yet have an executed isda master agreement with the counterparty  the fair values of individual swap transactions are recorded as components of unrealized gains or losses on credit swaps  at fair value  dependent upon whether the individual contract was at a gain or a loss 
as of december   we had no outstanding credit swaps with any counterparties with whom we had not yet executed isda master agreements 
as a general rule  when we sell credit default protection  it is our intention to maintain the transaction until maturity 
however  there are two sets of circumstances in which we could elect to terminate transactions prior to maturity  and we monitor our portfolio on a continuing basis to assess whether those circumstances are present 
first  whenever we receive new information suggesting that the credit quality of the underlying risk has deteriorated to a material degree  we consider the possibility of terminating the transaction  usually at a loss  to avoid a larger loss that could result if the credit swap were to remain in place until a credit event occurs 
the principal factor that governs our decision regarding termination in these circumstances is whether we believe that the underlying risk has become substantially greater than the level of risk we would choose to assume in entering into a new sale of credit default protection 
as of december   we have terminated due to credit considerations less than of the notional amount of credit swaps under which we sold credit default protection 
second  we may elect to terminate a transaction for reasons other than credit considerations 
terminations of this type may generate gains or losses 
in making a decision to terminate a transaction for reasons other than credit considerations  we consider a number of different factors  including the absolute amount of the unrealized gain or loss we could realize  the likelihood of additional gains or losses arising from the position  our view as to whether the capital dedicated to the position could be profitably reallocated to other opportunities over a foreseeable horizon  the total size of our portfolio in relation to our capital and the total size of our swap positions and exposures with a particular counterparty 
we refer to terminations effected under these circumstances as resizing or rebalancing 
the majority of our resizing occurred during the second and third quarters of  when market credit swap premium levels had dropped dramatically from their historic highs 
as of december   we have terminated approximately of credit swaps under which we sold credit default protection based on resizing or rebalancing considerations 
we may terminate a credit swap in one of two ways 
we may negotiate an agreed termination through the original counterparty an unwind 
we may negotiate an assignment and novation of our rights and obligations under the credit swap to a third party an assignment 
as an alternative to terminating a transaction  we may enter into an equal and opposite transaction with a third party under which we purchase credit default protection on terms that match the terms of the original transaction an offset 
in this last case  both sides of the position may subsequently be unwound or assigned 
in the event of an unwind or assignment  we pay or receive a cash settlement negotiated with the counterparty or assignee  based on the fair value of the credit swap contract and the accrued premium on the swap contract at the time of negotiation 
the amounts we pay or receive are recorded as a realization of fair value and as a realization of accrued premiums in the period in which the termination occurs 
in the past  where we have purchased credit protection as short term investments  we incurred the cost of paying premiums until we terminated the purchased protection 
we undertook these transactions with the expectation that the market credit swap premium level for the reference entity would rise subsequent to our purchase of protection  but any gains upon termination may not have sufficed to offset the premium expense we had incurred while holding the purchased protection 
furthermore  the market credit swap premium level for the reference entity may have fallen and we may have incurred termination losses as well as premium expenses as a result 
the fair value of our credit swaps purchased would have been affected by market credit swap premium levels 
expenses our expenses are primarily employee compensation and other administrative expenses  including rent for our premises  professional fees and depreciation of our software and fixtures 
compensation expense includes salaries and employee benefits  cash bonuses and stock based compensation 
distributions on preferred securities and debt securities primus financial has issued primus financial cumulative preferred stock that pays periodic distributions 
the cost of these distributions is included in our consolidated statements of operations as distributions on preferred securities of a subsidiary 
further details of the nature and cost of these securities is included in our discussion of liquidity and capital resources 
primus financial completed the issuance of million of subordinated deferrable interest notes on july  and the issuance of million of subordinated deferrable interest notes on december  the interest cost associated with these debt issuances is recorded as interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes primus guaranty  primus bermuda and primus financial are not expected to be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business in the united states and as a result are not expected to be subject to united states federal  state or local income tax 
primus asset management is a united states domiciled corporation and is subject to united states federal  state and local income tax on its income  including on fees received from primus financial 
primus re may be subject to united states federal  state or local income tax  or primus asset management may be required to include all or part of primus re s income in calculating its liability for united states federal  state or local income tax  depending on the manner in which primus re conducts its business and the tax elections it makes 
the maximum combined rate of united states corporate federal  state and local income tax that could apply to primus financial or primus bermuda  were they found to be engaged in a united states business in new york city and subject to income tax  is approximately not including united states branch profits tax that would be imposed on primus bermuda were primus financial deemed to be making distributions to primus bermuda 
for united states federal income tax purposes  primus guaranty and primus bermuda are likely to be treated as pfics 
critical accounting policies valuation of credit swaps from the inception of our business  we have applied statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
sfas requires recognition of all credit swaps on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of the credit swaps depends on a number of factors  primarily the market level of credit swap premiums associated with individual reference entities 
credit swaps are valued using market standard pricing models which calculate the net present value of differences between future premiums on currently quoted market credit swaps and the contractual future credit swap premiums on contracts we have undertaken 
our pricing model has been internally developed but is benchmarked against a market standard model 
generally  our model uses quoted market credit swap premium data that we purchase from an independent pricing service 
this service takes pricing information from a number of prominent dealers and brokers in the credit swap market across a range of standard maturities and restructuring terms  and creates average market credit swap premium quotes on specific reference entities 
we believe there are a variety of factors that may influence market credit swap premium levels 
the principal factor is the market s view of the probability that a reference entity will default over the multi year horizon typical for a credit swap contract 
those views in turn are influenced by the state of the economy  the outlook for corporate financial health in general as well as the outlook for particular industries and companies 
additional factors include the magnitude of debt outstanding and debt paying capacity within those same industries and companies 
one factor specific to the credit swap market is the capacity of credit swap market participants to sell credit swaps 
if  for example  commercial banks are actively buying protection to manage their regulatory capital  this will tend  other factors being equal  to absorb the capacity of protection sellers and cause an increase in market credit swap premiums 
conversely  creation of special purpose vehicles that sell protection create additional protection seller capacity and  absent additional demand  can cause a decrease in market premiums 
absent rapid and steep changes  interest rates have  at most  a limited effect on market credit swap premium levels 
financial guarantees we have undertaken a limited amount of financial guarantee business through our subsidiary  primus re 
financial guarantees are insurance contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party 
primus re designs its guarantee contracts to qualify as non derivatives in accordance with the scope exception under paragraph d of sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we account for our financial guarantee contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
this requires that premiums are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract and that losses are recorded in the period that they occur based on an estimate of the ultimate cost of losses incurred 
policy acquisition costs include only those expenses that relate primarily to  and vary with  premium production 
no policy acquisition costs have been deferred by us as of december   as any such amounts have been immaterial 
as of december   only three contracts had been written 
we do not actively offer financial guarantee insurance 
rather  it is an alternative we have available when a counterparty requests an insurance contract instead of a credit swap 
generally  a counterparty s choice of a financial guarantee insurance contract versus a credit swap is determined by economic terms available in the marketplace as well as regulatory and accounting considerations 
also  the purchaser of an insurance contract cannot submit a claim for payment unless it has an insurable loss  whereas the purchaser of a credit swap need not have actual exposure to the underlying risk 
internal use software costs and formation expenses during our development stage through march   we were developing our proprietary technology 
the primary applications developed were capital models to support primus financial s aaa aaa counterparty ratings and a transactional platform to control our credit swap activities  ranging from trade administration to support for financial accounting and reporting 
the software and related costs of developing the capital model and control platform of approximately million were capitalized in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  as of december  during and  software development costs of thousand and thousand were capitalized  respectively 
these costs are being amortized over five years on a straight line basis 
capitalized costs are reviewed periodically for impairment 
stock based employee compensation plans in  we adopted the fair value approach on a prospective basis for recording stock based employee compensation in accordance with the fair value method prescribed in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under these rules  compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of stock options  restricted shares and restricted share units at the time of an award  adjusted and amortized over the related vesting period 
the fair value of the stock options granted is determined through the use of a market standard option pricing model  which requires judgment as to appropriate volatility and interest rate factors 
prior to our ipo  in the absence of a public market for our common shares  management and the board of directors estimated the market value of our common shares for all options  restricted share units and share issuances based on valuation opinions from independent valuation consultants 
after the ipo  the fair value used is the current market value of our common shares at the grant date 
results of operations overview we observed fluctuations in market credit swap premium levels during in the first quarter  premium levels on credit swaps were relatively unchanged from levels as of december  in the first quarter  we sold billion of new credit swaps 
in the second quarter  we observed significant increases in market premium levels  particularly in certain reference entity industry sectors  such as automobiles and insurance 
we increased the volume of new credit swaps sold in the second quarter to take advantage of the higher premium levels 
during this quarter we sold billion of new credit swaps  partly offset by maturities of million 
during the second quarter we also terminated a number of credit swaps sold in order to mitigate our credit risk on certain entities which had become the targets of leveraged buy outs  resulting in realized losses of approximately million 
in the third and fourth quarters  we observed declines in the level of market premiums falling back to levels similar to those prevailing in the first quarter of the year 
we sold billion of new credit swaps in each of the third and fourth quarters as we tempered our growth to reflect the lower levels of market premiums 
we incurred credit mitigation costs of million in the third quarter and thousand in the fourth quarter as we further reduced our exposures to reference entities which had become leveraged buy out targets 
during  we expanded the range of our activities 
in april  we wrote our first tranche transaction  whereby we sold credit protection referencing a portfolio containing obligations of multiple reference entities 
subsequent to this transaction  market premium levels for most investment grade tranches have fallen and we did not enter into any other tranche transactions in we recorded premium income from  as well as an unrealized gain  on the tranche sold during in the third quarter of  we obtained rating agency permission to write a limited amount of protection against reference entities in the bb ba rating category 
we sold million of credit swaps in this category during the fourth quarter of during  we reduced and ultimately terminated our portfolio of swaps where we had bought protection in anticipation of subsequent increases in market premiums on specific reference entities 
our interest income in was significantly higher than in the previous year as a result of three factors 
market interest rates increased generally during the year 
we extended the average duration of our investment portfolio in  which further increased the yield on our investments 
in addition  average invested balances were higher in as a result of retained cash earnings and the investment of proceeds from our ipo and primus financial debt issuances during and a portion of our credit swap portfolio is denominated in euros and we earn net euro premiums as a result 
during we changed our previous policy of holding the net cash premiums in euros 
we now retain only a small euro working balance and sell the balance of euro premiums received for us dollars 
we incurred a net revaluation loss of million on the euro balances we held during year ended december  compared with year ended december  on a us gaap basis  we had net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the reduction in net income in was primarily driven by unrealized losses on our portfolio of credit swaps sold  coupled with losses realized from the early termination of credit swaps 
these reductions in revenues were offset in part by increased premium revenues from a larger credit swap portfolio and higher interest income 
net credit swap revenue net credit swap revenue was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

premium income on credit swaps sold increased primarily as a result of the expansion in our credit swap portfolio 
the quarterly average notional amounts outstanding of credit swaps sold were billion and billion in and  respectively 
we began to sell protection in tranche format during the second quarter of  whereby we sell credit swaps referencing portfolios containing obligations of multiple reference entities 
premium income from the tranche sold was thousand for the year ended december   and the notional amount outstanding was million at december  the premium expense on credit swaps purchased as short term investments was million and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   we had no outstanding credit swaps purchased as short term investments  whereas the notional amount outstanding at december  was million 
the average outstanding balance was higher during than in  resulting in higher premium expense in the notional amounts of credit swaps that we had purchased to offset credit risk on certain credit swaps sold were and million at december  and net realized gains losses on credit swaps our business strategy  for primus financial  is generally to hold swaps we sell until maturity 
however  there are circumstances in which we may terminate a credit swap prior to maturity  either as a result of credit considerations or portfolio rebalancing considerations 
we cannot identify at the outset of any credit swap transaction whether the credit swap will be terminated or otherwise disposed of prior to its maturity 
if the credit swaps we terminate are at attractive market values  we are able to realize gains 
in certain circumstances we will terminate a credit swap at a realized loss 
in general  we terminate credit swaps at a loss where we perceive that the credit quality of the underlying reference entity risk has deteriorated  and we wish to reduce or eliminate our exposure to the reference entity 
we may also terminate a credit swap at a loss in order to create opportunities to rebalance our exposure to a reference entity 
we terminated million and million notional amount of credit swaps sold during the years ended december  and  respectively 
net realized gains losses on the early termination of credit swaps sold were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net realized losses incurred during were primarily the result of our decision to mitigate our exposure to a limited number of reference entities  which had become the subject of leveraged buy outs  which increased the credit risk of those reference entities 
in the past we also purchased credit protection as a short term investment  and  in that case  early termination of the credit swaps was a fundamental part of our business strategy 
in the course of  we terminated the portfolio of swaps purchased as short term investments because results had not met our expectations 
we terminated million and million notional amount of credit swaps purchased during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we realized a net loss of million and a net gain of million from the early termination of credit swaps purchased as short term investments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net realized gains losses for the years ended december  and are summarized below

net unrealized gains losses on credit swaps net unrealized losses on credit swaps were million for the year ended december  as compared with a loss of thousand for the year ended december  the change in unrealized losses on credit swaps reflects the change in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio during these periods 
the loss in on credit swaps sold is partly attributable to an erosion of fair value as a result of the credit swaps with positive fair values having shorter remaining maturities and partly due to unrealized losses on credit swaps on certain reference entities which were downgraded and or the subject of leveraged buy outs during the period 
the unrealized gain on credit swaps purchased as short term investments in is due to the termination of our positions in this portfolio  with the result that unrealized losses were converted from an unrealized to a realized status

asset management fees we commenced our third party asset management activity during we recognized thousand and thousand of asset management fees for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our asset management contracts also provide for contingent performance fees  none of which have been earned or accrued at december  or  respectively 
interest income earned we earned interest income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income is attributable to higher average invested balances derived from the july issuance of million of subordinated debt by primus financial and the raising of additional equity through our ipo in october  retained cash earnings  and higher yields on our investment portfolio 
the increase in yields is attributable to generally higher market rates of interest prevailing during  coupled with an extension in the duration of our investment portfolio 
weighted average yields on the cash equivalents and available for sale investments were in the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  our total cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments were approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
foreign currency revaluation we sell and buy credit swaps denominated in us dollars and euros

in  the euro lost value against the us dollar resulting in revaluation losses of million

employee compensation in includes million of compensation cost due to accelerated vesting of employee stock associated with the ipo 
excluding this accelerated vesting cost  employee compensation increased in by million 
this increase was due in part to the increase in our number of employees as our business expanded its operations 
in addition  in the first quarter of we accrued an additional expense of approximately thousand for the accelerated compensation expenses and accelerated vesting of stock related to the departure of former employees 
professional and legal fees expense includes audit and tax advisor expenses  legal costs and director and officer insurance expense 
the increase in professional and legal fees is primarily related to the requirements of being a public company 
other operating expenses include rent  bank fees and investment management fees  rating agency fees  brokerage expense  travel and entertainment  exchange fees and other administrative expenses 
interest expense and preferred distributions for the years ended december  and  we incurred million and million of interest expense  respectively 
the interest expense was primarily incurred on the million year subordinated debt that was issued by primus financial in july the interest rate for the year subordinated debt was fixed at for a period of one year from the issuance date  and thereafter has been reset at day intervals 
the interest rate on this instrument averaged in the period from july through december and in on december   primus financial issued in aggregate million of subordinated deferrable interest notes  consisting of million of series a notes and million of series b notes  which mature in june the interest rate on the series a notes was fixed on the issuance date at a rate of for days and then subsequently the rate will be set every days through a monthly auction process 
the interest rate on the series b notes was fixed on the issuance date at a rate of for one year and then subsequently  the rate will be set every days through a monthly auction process 
primus financial also made net distributions of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  on the primus financial cumulative preferred stock issued in december the average rate paid on these securities was and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes provision for income taxes was thousand for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
primus guaranty had a net us deferred tax asset fully offset by a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as previously discussed  it is expected that only the income of primus asset management and its subsidiary  primus re  are likely to be subject to united states federal and local income taxes 
however  were primus bermuda to be subject to income tax  at a combined united states federal  new york state and new york city income tax rate of on its us gaap income  then its income tax expense excluding interest and penalties would have been approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these figures assume that primus financial is not deemed to be making distributions to primus bermuda  such distributions would subject primus bermuda to an additional united states federal branch profits tax 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  we had net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net income in was primarily driven by the lower unrealized gains in the value of the portfolio of credit swaps sold  coupled with increased expenses and unrealized losses in our portfolio of credit swaps purchased for short term appreciation

asset management fees we commenced our third party asset management activity during and earned fees of thousand through december  the fees earned represent the accrual of annual management fees 
our asset management contracts also provide for contingent performance fees  none of which have been earned or accrued at december  interest income earned we had interest income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increased interest income is attributable to average higher invested balances and higher yields in the cash equivalents and short term investment accounts as compared with the year ended december  average yields on the cash equivalent and short term investments were in the year ended december  and in the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a general increase in market interest rates in the latter part of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively

the increase in employee compensation over these periods was primarily due to the increase in the number of employees as the business expanded its operations  coupled with the increased expense associated with the vesting of employee stock and option awards 
the ipo resulted in the accelerated vesting of employee stock and option grants which resulted in additional expense of million in the last quarter of professional and legal fees relate to audit and tax advisor expenses  legal costs and director and officer insurance expense 
the primary reason for the decrease in professional and legal fees in is lower audit fees incurred during  as compared with  when we completed our initial audit 
depreciation and amortization principally relates to the amortization of our internally developed software and the depreciation of our furniture and fixtures 
software amortization decreased by approximately million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   as a result of a write off during of approximately million relating to previously capitalized software that was no longer in active use by the company 
technology and data feed expense relates to the maintenance of our technology platform and the cost of providing electronic data to our credit and investing teams  and remained consistent with the prior year 
the excess of loss insurance policy premium expense in relates to a surety policy to cover excess credit losses  which primus financial acquired in march and terminated in march  as it was no longer required as support for its ratings by the rating agencies 
other operating expenses include rent  bank fees  rating agency fees  brokerage expense  travel and entertainment  exchange fees and other administrative expenses  which increased over the prior year due to the expansion of our operations  and our listing on the nyse 
interest expense and preferred distributions for the year ended december   we incurred million of interest expense primarily on the million year subordinated debt that was issued by primus financial in july the interest rate for the year subordinated debt was fixed at for a period of one year from the issuance date 
primus financial also made net distributions of million and million during and  respectively  on the primus financial cumulative preferred stock issued in december the average rate paid on these securities was and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes benefit provisions for income taxes were thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
primus guaranty had a net deferred tax asset fully offset by a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the change in the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance between and results from primus asset management s estimated net operating loss 
as previously discussed  it is expected that only the income of primus asset management and its subsidiary  primus re  are likely to be subject to united states federal and local income taxes 
however  were primus bermuda to be subject to income tax  at a combined united states federal  new york state and new york city income tax rate of  on its us gaap income  then its income tax expense excluding interest and penalties would have been approximately million for and million for these figures assume that primus financial is not deemed to be making distributions to primus bermuda  such distributions would subject primus bermuda to an additional united states federal branch profits tax 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect that those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for losses that may result from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a consequence of market conditions 
our primary market risk is increasing or decreasing market credit swap premium levels  which increase or decrease the fair value of our credit swap portfolio 
market credit swap premium levels change as a result of specific events or news related to a reference entity  such as a change in a credit rating by any of the rating agencies 
additionally  market credit swap premium levels can vary as a result of changes in market sentiment 
as a general matter  given our strategy of holding credit swaps sold until maturity  we do not seek to manage our overall exposure to market credit swap premium levels  and we expect fluctuations in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio as a result of these changes 
as of december   each one basis point increase or decrease in market credit swap premiums would decrease or increase the fair value of our credit swap portfolio by approximately million 
we face other market risks  which are likely to have a lesser impact upon our net income than those associated with market credit swap premium level risk 
these other risks include interest rate risk associated with market interest rate movements 
these movements may affect the value of our credit swap portfolio as our pricing model includes an interest rate component  which is used to discount future expected cash flows 
interest rate movements may also affect the carrying value of and yield on our investments 
the primus financial cumulative preferred stock pays distributions that are based upon the auction rate preferred market 
a difference between the rates we pay in the auction rate preferred market and the interest rates we receive on our investments may result in an additional cost to our company 
assuming that auction results with respect to the primus financial cumulative preferred stock reflect prevailing short term interest rates  each basis point increase or decrease in the level of those rates would increase or decrease primus financial s annual distribution cost by approximately  for each of the series a and series b mmp receipts  but would not affect distributions on the series b mmp receipts as the interest and auction rate for such mmp receipts were set for a one year period on january  in addition  interest rate movements may increase or decrease the interest expense we incur on our million of subordinated deferrable interest notes 
a basis point increase in the level of those rates would increase primus financial s interest expense by  annually  however at december   the interest rate on the million series b subordinated deferrable interest notes was set for a one year period expiring in december of counterparty risk represents the potential for loss should one or more of our counterparties be unable to meet its obligations due to bankruptcy or a similar event  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our counterparties generally have investment grade credit ratings 
at december   the notional and fair value amount of credit swaps outstanding with respect to our counterparties that had credit ratings of below investment grade were million and thousand  respectively 
the premiums on these transactions were fully prepaid by the counterparties
