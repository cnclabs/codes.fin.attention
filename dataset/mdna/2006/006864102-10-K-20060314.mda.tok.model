item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and market innovative products for women s health 
our initial focus is on reproductive healthcare  using our proprietary technologies to predict preterm birth and assess infertility 
our principal product is a patented diagnostic test fullterm  the fetal fibronectin test  that utilizes a single use  disposable cassette and is analyzed on our patented instrument  the tli 
iq 
system 
this fda approved product is designed to objectively determine a woman s risk of preterm birth by detecting the presence of a specific protein  fetal fibronectin  in vaginal secretions during pregnancy 
we began selling our single use  disposable fullterm  the fetal fibronectin test in and launched our second generation system  the tli 
iq 
system  in sales of tli 
iq 
systems to hospital and clinical laboratories allow healthcare providers access to our fullterm  the fetal fibronectin test  resulting in the potential for better patient care and for significant cost savings by avoiding unnecessary medical treatment 
we believe the key factors underlying our growth since include greater healthcare provider acceptance  demonstrated cost savings from the use of our tests  expanded reimbursement coverage by insurance companies  expansion of our sales force and increased marketing efforts 
continued growth in test volume and revenue will depend on the above and a number of factors  including placing additional tli 
iq 
systems in hospitals and clinical laboratories  increasing utilization of existing tli 
iq 
systems  increasing healthcare provider acceptance for other fda approved uses of the product and developing additional applications or products 
product sales our product sales are derived primarily from the sale of our disposable fetal fibronectin test cassettes 
in addition  we derive a small portion of our revenues from the sale of tli 
iq 
systems and other consumables 
sales in the united states accounted for and of our product sales in the years ended december  and  respectively 
international sales accounted for and of our product sales in fiscal and  respectively 
we currently use distributors for sales outside of the united states and canada 
our 
table of contents business has been in the past and may continue to be seasonal and is affected by customer ordering patterns  which may involve quarterly or semi annual orders  as well as other factors which may cause quarterly variances in our revenue 
as such  revenue may not increase in sequential quarters and our net income may fluctuate significantly 
cost of product sales our cost of product sales represents the cost of materials  direct labor and overhead associated with the manufacture of our products  delivery charges  lab services and royalties 
royalty costs for the year ended december  were million or of product sales  an increase of million from the million for the year ended december  the increase royalties was primarily the result of a non recurring reduction in of accrued royalties of million attributable to royalties accrued under a license agreement that we determined were in excess of amounts actually due 
although royalty costs as a percentage of product sales is expected to fluctuate as it is dependent on several factors  including the level and type of sales and the level of allowed deductions  we believe royalty costs as a percentage of revenue will remain below for the year ended december   assuming no new licenses involving royalties are required 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing personnel and sales force incentive compensation and costs related to travel  trade shows  promotional materials and programs  advertising and healthcare provider education materials and events 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses for accounting  human resources  information technology and corporate administration functions 
other costs include facility costs and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for company sponsored and collaborative research and development activities 
these expenses consist primarily of direct and research related allocated overhead expenses such as facilities costs  salaries and benefits  and material and supply costs including costs associated with clinical trials 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb  issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee and director stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
we will adopt sfas r on january  we have selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the fair value of our awards and have selected the modified prospective method in adopting sfas r 
we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our financial statements but cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adoption because it will depend upon the levels of share based payments granted in the future and other factors 
however  we expect our selling and marketing  general and administrative  research and development expenses and cost of sales to increase in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r in in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  
table of contents we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in march  the fasb published fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which clarifies that the term  conditional asset retirement obligations  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
the interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation is effective december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition our revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery to the customer has occurred and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
we use shipping documents and  if necessary  third party proof of delivery to verify delivery 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
revenue from our laboratory services is recognized as tests are performed 
contract revenues are recorded over the life of the contract or as performance occurs and the related earnings process is completed based on the performance requirements of the contract 
with respect to sales to distributors  revenue is generally recognized upon shipment  as the title  risks and rewards of ownership of the products pass to the distributors and the selling price of our product is fixed and determinable at that point 
the selling prices on sales to a certain distributor through june  were not fixed and determinable until the distributor shipped the products to the end user 
consequently  for this distributor  we recognized revenue only after the shipment of product to the end user 
additionally  on july   we entered into a services agreement with a laboratory and fulfillment company 
under the terms of the agreement  this company provided certain domestic product distribution and testing services for us 
through september   we recognized revenue upon the shipment of products from this company to the end user as the title  risks and rewards of ownership of the products pass from us to the end user at that time 
on october   we discontinued using this fulfillment company and began to recognize revenue upon shipment of our products 

table of contents valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost or market 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to the estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is determined based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
historically  we have not experienced significant credit losses related to an individual customer or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area 
however  deterioration in our ability to collect our receivables could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and increase our general and administrative expenses 
stock based compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors  any deferred stock compensation we record as a component of stockholders equity 
deferred stock compensation for options granted to employees and directors is recorded if the fair value of our common stock on the date the options are granted is greater than their exercise prices 
deferred stock compensation is amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting periods of the options using the straight line method 
additionally  for options granted to non employees  the fair value of the options  estimated using the black scholes valuation model  is periodically re measured with the resulting value charged to expense over the period of the related services being rendered 
we recorded stock based compensation expense related to all of our options of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of deferred stock compensation that is scheduled to be expensed over the next four years subject to vesting requirements 
royalty costs royalty costs are included as a cost of product sales 
the royalty costs are determined by applying the royalty rate in each license agreement to the specific product offerings included in that particular agreement  including any deductions to sales or royalty cost allowed under the royalty terms 
the determination of royalty costs can be affected by various factors including changes in the terms of the underlying agreements  changes in our interpretation of the application of the terms of the underlying agreement  changes in the level of revenue  changes in the amount of revenue derived from international sales and e tegrity test sales  changes in the level of allowed deductions and additional product licenses 
income taxes we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
changes in these estimates may result in significant increases or decreases to our tax provision in a subsequent period  which in turn would affect net income 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and  if necessary  we adjust the amount of such allowance 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we assessed our deferred tax assets at the end of and determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize approximately  of net deferred tax assets based upon our forecast of future taxable income and other relevant factors 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of product sales of certain items in our statements of income 
years ended december  product sales cost of product sales gross profit operating costs and expenses selling and marketing general and administration research and development total operating costs and expenses income from operations interest income expense and other  net income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  product sales years ended december  in millions change change product sales the growth in sales was primarily due to an approximate million increase in sales volume of fetal fibronectin test cassettes and a slight increase in average selling prices  partially offset by slight decreases in revenue from the sale of other products of approximately million 
cost of product sales years ended december  in millions change change cost of product sales the increase in cost of product sales in as compared to was primarily the result of a non recurring reduction in of accrued royalties of million attributable to royalties accrued under a license agreement that we determined were in excess of amounts actually due 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of product sales was for the year ended december  as compared to in  which excludes the effect of the non recurring reduction in accrued royalties 
gross profit years ended december  in millions change change gross profit 
table of contents the gross profit increase was primarily due to increased sales partially offset by the non recurring reduction in accrued royalties in of million and increased standard product costs from increased unit sales 
gross margin was for the year ended december  as compared to  excluding the non recurring reduction in accrued royalties of million  in selling and marketing expenses years ended december  in millions change change selling and marketing expenses the increase in expense year over year was largely attributable to million related to the expansion of our direct sales force  million in increased marketing expenses to support the growth in product sales and million in stock based compensation expense 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of product sales decreased slightly to in the year ended december  from in the prior year 
we expect our selling and marketing expenditures to increase in as we continue our efforts to increase our market penetration 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  in millions change change general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of product sales were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increases were primarily attributable to costs associated with being a public company of million  other general facility costs of million  costs associated with accruals for sales tax of million and amortized deferred compensation costs of million all partially offset by a decrease in patent expense of million 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in primarily related to costs associated with being a public company and anticipated increased headcount 
research and development expenses years ended december  in millions change change research and development expenses the increase is primarily due to costs associated with our continued product development efforts of million in addition to increases associated with headcount and associated personnel costs of million and amortized deferred compensation costs of million 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for we expect that our research and development costs will increase in as we continue our product development efforts 
interest income years ended december  in millions change change interest income the increase is primarily due to higher cash balances earning interest largely as a result of our initial public offering that was completed in december we expect interest income to fluctuate based on prevailing interest rates and changes in our cash balances 

table of contents provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of  for the year ended december  the benefit from income taxes represents the reversal of a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of  net of federal alternative minimum taxes and state income tax expense of  for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes of  related to federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  is as compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the period differs from the federal statutory rate of principally due to the benefit derived by reversing the valuation allowance to our deferred tax assets in the current year net of non deductible stock compensation charges and miscellaneous other items 
the effective tax rate of for differs from the statutory rate of principally due to the use of previously unbenefitted net operating loss carryforwards net of miscellaneous non deductible items and state income tax expense

 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and  if necessary  we adjust the amount of such allowance 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we assessed our deferred tax assets at the end of and determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize approximately  of net deferred tax assets based upon our forecast of future taxable income and other relevant factors 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
the state research and development tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
we have reviewed whether the utilization of its net operating losses and research credits were subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
as a result of the reduction of our valuation allowances which had an affect of recognizing our deferred tax asset  our tax rate is likely to be at or above the combined federal and state statuatory rate of year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  product sales product sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or million  from million for the year ended december  the growth in sales was primarily due to an approximate million increase in sales volume of fetal fibronectin test cassettes  partially offset by slight decreases revenue from the sale of other products of approximately million 
cost of product sales cost of product sales for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of product sales was primarily the result of reduced royalty costs of million and a non recurring reduction in accrued royalties and related royalty costs of million that we determined were in excess of amounts actually due 
the decrease and non recurring reduction of million were primarily related to significant new information received which allowed us to conclude that no royalties were due or are required under a license agreement 
in addition  
table of contents a decrease in other product costs of approximately million was offset by approximately million of costs related to increased unit volumes for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  non royalty related costs remained unchanged for the years ended december  and as costs related to increased unit sales were offset by lower per unit manufacturing costs 
as a percent of revenue  cost of product sales was of revenue for the year ended december   excluding the effect of the non recurring reduction in accrued royalties and related royalty costs  as compared to for the same period in the prior year due to the continued reduction in royalty costs

there was no interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to  of interest expense in the interest expense in was primarily related to a note payable in conjunction with the conclusion of a co promotion and distribution agreement with a major us distributor 
the note was repaid by june  provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  related to federal alternative minimum taxes and state taxes compared to approximately  for 
table of contents our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for both periods is lower than the statutory rate due primarily to tax benefits arising from the utilization of previously unbenefitted net operating losses to the extent allowable under current law 
our deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
the state net operating loss carry forwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
the state research and development tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
we reviewed whether the utilization of its net operating losses and research credits were subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our operations have been primarily financed through public and private equity investments  working capital provided by our product sales  capital leases  and research and development contracts 
as of december  our cash and cash equivalents were million 
all of our cash equivalents have original maturities of three months or less 
during the year ended december   our operating activities provided cash of approximately million  compared to approximately million during the increase year over year is primarily related to the increase in net income partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and deferred tax assets 
accounts receivable increased due to increased product sales 
deferred tax assets increased as we recorded a reduction in the valuation allowance on certain of our net deferred tax assets in our investing activities used cash of approximately million during the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of investing activities in for both periods were related to purchases of equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million during the year ended december   as compared to million during  were related to cash generated from stock option exercises in and our initial public offering proceeds in for the year ended december   our operating activities provided cash of approximately million  compared to approximately million during the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in net income partially offset by changes in working capital  including an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued royalties 
for the year ended december   our investing activities used cash of approximately million compared to million for the year ended december  investing activities in were related to purchases of equipment  while the investing activity in was primarily due to our acquisition of the salest test 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million compared to million used during the year ended december  the million used during the year ended december  was primarily related to repayments of notes payable 
in december  we issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share in an initial public offering and received approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
as of december   we had no long term debt  capital lease obligations or long term purchase agreements or commitments other than two facility leases which we have for a one year term with two one year renewal options and an operating lease for a telephone system 
future minimum operating lease 
table of contents obligations under these leases as of december  are included in the table below 
the table also reflects our expectations regarding reductions in accrued royalties in thousands 
payments due in total after contractual obligations operating leases royalties accrued total in addition to cash generated from product sales  we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next two years 
however  future research and development  clinical trials and sales and marketing expenses  as well as administration support  or licensing or acquisition of other products may require additional capital resources 
we may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  capital lease transactions  corporate collaborations or other means 
due to the uncertainty of financial markets  financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
therefore  we may raise additional capital from time to time due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we have sufficient funds for planned operations 
our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors  including success of our product sales and related collections  future expenses to expand and support our sales and marketing activities  costs relating to changes in regulatory policies or laws that affect our operations  maintaining and expanding our manufacturing capacity  the level of investment in research and development and clinical trials required to maintain and improve our technology position  costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and our need or decision to acquire or license businesses  products or technologies 
if at any time sufficient capital is not available  either through existing capital resources or through raising additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our research  clinical or sales and marketing programs or our entire business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk to date  all of our sales and costs have been denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we believe that there is no material exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we hold no derivative financial instruments and do not currently engage in hedging activities 
our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to the investment of our excess cash into highly liquid financial investments with original maturities of three months or less 
we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we have assessed that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from them
