item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included in item in this report 
the discussion 
table of contents and analysis is relevant to our historical results of operations  which reports consolidated results including two segments  domestic and foreign 
market overview domestically  our business is concentrated in the energy and telecommunication markets 
during  our sales into both of these markets increased 
the increase in the energy market was primarily a result of the severe weather experienced in the gulf coast region of the united states in late summer 
our sales increase in the telecommunication market was driven primarily by the increased activity in laying fiber to the premises fttp 
we believe the passage of the the energy policy act of will streamline the process for the approval of new transmission and distribution projects 
we also believe it will lead to increased investment in new transmission and distribution grids  new technologies and upgrading the current installed base over the next five to ten years 
this coupled with our development of an enhanced product offering in both transmission and distribution provides us with a greater opportunity to enhance our participation in the anticipated increased project business in the energy market 
during  we witnessed the consolidation of product distributors and actual service providers in the telecommunication market 
we are experiencing more competitive price pressures as the service providers continue to consolidate in an expanding market 
additionally  we believe the investment in the installed copper wire technology continues to decline as the investment in fiber and wireless technologies continue to expand in this market 
through the first nine months ended september   we experienced an increase in sales primarily as a result of fttp initiatives of certain customers 
during the fourth quarter of  the pace of fttp installations slowed while these customers re evaluated their inventory levels 
we anticipate the pace of building fttp to resume in at levels similar to  but it is dependent upon our customers commitment to their fttp strategy 
we believe that our current product offerings and product developments are well positioned to address the expanding influence of fiber networks in this market 
we anticipate our foreign energy markets will continue to expand as new transmission and distribution projects are announced 
fttp initiatives in our foreign markets continue to lag behind the pace of the domestic initiative 
however  like the domestic market  we believe foreign fiber communications networks will grow  and we will benefit from this growth but at a lower level than our success in the domestic market 
preface we achieved record sales in our combined energy and telecommunication markets in net income was million in compared to million in included in the results is a million gain on the sale of a japanese joint venture and a million one time tax benefit as a result of the american jobs creation act of excluding the impact of these two items in  net income increased 
in costs and expenses increased million  which included approximately million more than in external costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of our costs and expenses increased excluding the impact of these compliance costs  higher commissions on higher sales and foreign currency 
results of operations compared to in  consolidated net sales were million  an increase of million  or  from domestic net sales in of million increased million  or 
the domestic increase was primarily due to volume increases in the energy and communications markets 
our top ten domestic customers account for less than of domestic net sales 
we anticipate our sales in the energy and telecommunication markets will continue to increase in but at a slower pace than we experienced in  while we believe our data communication sales in will outpace the rate of increase 
foreign net sales in of million increased million  or 
foreign net sales were favorably impacted by million  or  when converted to us dollars  as a result of the weaker us dollar compared to most foreign currencies 
our foreign net sales increased in all markets throughout the world  with our australian subsidiary accounting for of our consolidated net sales

we believe our foreign markets will remain strong for but will continue to experience competitive price pressure

ltd  a joint venture 
the selling price was approximately million and is included in the proceeds from the sale of equity investment 
we are continually analyzing potential acquisition candidates and business alternatives  but we currently have no commitments that would materially affect the operations of the business 
cash used in financing activities was million compared to million in the previous year 
this decrease was primarily a result of greater debt borrowings during and a greater number of common shares repurchased in when compared to we have commitments under operating leases primarily for office and manufacturing space  transportation equipment  office and computer equipment and capital leases primarily for equipment 
see note e in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the future minimum rental commitments under these leasing arrangements 
one such lease is for our aircraft with a lease commitment through april under the terms of the lease  we maintain the risk for the residual value in excess of the market value of the aircraft 
at the present time  we believe our risks  if any  to be immaterial because the estimated market value of the aircraft approximates its residual value 

table of contents our financial position remains strong and our current ratio at december  was compared to at december  working capital of million has increased from the december  amount of million primarily due to million greater cash on hand and a million increase in inventory partially offset by a million reduction in receivables  million increase in current portion of long term debt and a million increase in accrued expenses 
at december   our unused balance under our main credit facility was million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 
the revolving credit agreement contains  among other provisions  requirements for maintaining levels of working capital  net worth  and profitability 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments  other contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we believe our existing cash position  together with our untapped borrowing capacity  provides substantial financial resources 
if we were to incur significant additional indebtedness  we expect to be able to meet liquidity needs under the credit facilities but at an increased cost for interest and commitment fees 
we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are summarized in the following tables payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years thousands of dollars long term debt a leases purchase commitments pension contribution b amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial less than commitments total year years years after years thousands of dollars letters of credit guarantees a interest is not included in the table  as all amounts are variable 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
b amount represents expected contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plan for the year ending december  future expected amounts have not been disclosed as such amounts are subject to change based on performance of the assets in the plan as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation 
see note c in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million and at december  the allowance represented less than of our trade receivables  compared to at december  the reduction in the allowance during was due to the write off of previously reserved customer balances in which collection was deemed remote 
excess and obsolescence reserves we have provided an allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence based on estimates of future demand  which is subject to change 
additionally  discrete provisions are made when facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be utilized 
at december  and  the allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence was of gross inventories 
if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or reversals of existing reserves may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles have been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  we believe that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 
our measurement date for our annual impairment test is january of each year 
we perform interim impairment tests if trigger events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
there were no trigger events during  or and  as such  only an annual impairment test was performed 
deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we established a valuation allowance to record our deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this standard requires that such items be recognized as current period charges 
the standard also establishes the concept of normal capacity and requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
any unallocated overhead must be recognized as an expense in the period incurred 
this standard is effective for inventory costs incurred starting january  because the company currently allocates fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion and present production levels are believed to approximate normal capacity  the company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets 
this standard amended apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  to eliminate the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets 
this standard replaces this exception with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this statement is effective for all nonmonetary asset exchanges completed by the company starting january  the company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements since the company does not typically engage in nonmonetary exchanges of assets 
in december  the fasb released sfas no 
r fasb r  share based payment 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement amends and clarifies the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments and to recognize this cost over the vesting period or time period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the reward 
this statement is effective for the company starting january  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
see note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact previous grants would have had on compensation expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the company s global operations 
as a result  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes the political and economic risks related to the company s foreign operations are mitigated due to the stability of the countries in which the company s largest foreign operations are located 
the company has no foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities and term notes  which consisted of borrowings of million at december  a basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 
million for the year ended december  the company s primary currency rate exposures are related to foreign denominated debt  intercompany debt  forward exchange contracts  foreign denominated receivables and cash and short term investments 
a hypothetical change in currency rates would have a favorable unfavorable impact on fair values of million and on income before tax of less than 
million
