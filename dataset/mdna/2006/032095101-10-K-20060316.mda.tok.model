tcs sells its products primarily to the data communications  storage and server markets  wireless infrastructure markets and industrial markets 
tcs had sales of million for the year ended december  the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated first to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the liabilities of tcs based upon their fair market values 
the excess purchase price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill 
the company is in the process of completing its analysis of fair value attributes of the assets acquired through the use of independent appraisals and management s estimates

the following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial information assuming that the tcs acquisition actually occurred as of the beginning of the period presented 
on a pro forma basis for the year ended december   tcs had sales and operating income of million and million  respectively 
such amounts along with million of additional pro forma interest expense and related bank fees on borrowings to fund the acquisition are reflected in the pro forma amounts shown below 
the pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate of the effects of the tcs acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth herein 
the unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the company s financial position or results of operations would have been had the tcs acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed  nor is it necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods 
for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share data net sales operating income net income net income per common share basic net income per common share diluted to supplement the pro forma combined financial information presented above  the company uses certain measures which are adjusted from the pro forma gaap amounts based upon actions taken either on the purchase date or known subsequent changes in cost structure  the results of which are as shown below 
these adjustments are provided to enhance the user s overall understanding of the company s current and expected financial performance and are forward looking 
the adjustments are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the tcs acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed  nor are they necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods 
such information should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the company s operations and business environment 
the following table sets forth cash savings that are expected to be achieved as of or immediately following the acquisition date as well as the reversal of non recurring restructuring costs and non recurring gains on the sale of a business  which management does not expect to reoccur in the future 
this information is included to assist investors and management in assessing the company s operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of the company s ongoing combined operations

these targets would not have been achieved at tcs s historic profitability levels and  as such  the related expense would not have been incurred 
ii teradyne had historically allocated corporate general and administrative costs to tcs which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above 
such costs included information technology  human resources  tax  legal  corporate treasury and finance as well as executive administration related items 
the acquisition agreement included the hiring of certain teradyne employees and assumption of certain agreements that related to services historically performed by teradyne for tcs

this adjustment represents the excess of the amount charged to tcs by teradyne for those centralized services over the actual cost incurred by tcs and amphenol since the acquisition 
iii teradyne had significant restructuring activities in and at tcs resulting in related expenses which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above 
no significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future  and as such  these costs are considered nonrecurring  and are therefore included above as expected savings 
iv tcs had recognized gains on the sale of a business in and which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above 
these gains are not expected to occur in the future 
environmental matters subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation in allied signal merged with honeywell international inc honeywell in december  amphenol and honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites 
amphenol and honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site 
the costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently reimbursed by honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in for sites covered by this agreement  to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition  honeywell is obligated to reimburse amphenol of such costs 
honeywell representatives work closely with the company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities covered by the agreement 
management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the environmental investigation  remedial and monitoring activities identified by the company  including those referred to above  are covered under the honeywell agreement 
inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating  aluminum  copper  brass and steel used for contacts  shells and cable  and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies  inserts and cable 
in general  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs 
risk management the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions 
in other cases involving us export sales  raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale  such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials

recent accounting changes in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
fas r share based payment 
fas r applies to all transactions involving the issuance  by a company  of its own equity stock  stock options  or other equity instruments in exchange for goods or services  including employee services 
fas r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock based compensation using the fair value of those stocks on the grant date with limited exceptions 
in april  the effective date of this statement was deferred and was effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company has adopted fas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
the impact of adoption of fas r is expected to result in approximately million of pre tax expense during although it will depend in part on the level of share based payments granted 
pensions the company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan plan covering us employees 
plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory 
certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees 
the pension expense for all pension plans approximated million  million and million in  and  respectively  and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january of the applicable year  including an expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption for us plans  we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our historical sixteen year compounded return of  which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return of  with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of and with high yield bond managers  with an expected rate of return of 
as of december   our asset allocation was with equity managers and with fixed income managers  including high yield managers 
we believe that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
based on this methodology  the company s expected long term rate of return assumption is for both and the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations 
the discount rate on this basis has decreased from at december  to at december  this will have the effect of increasing pension expense in by approximately 
million 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased basis points  the pension liability would have decreased million or increased million  respectively 
the company made cash contributions to the us pension plans of million and million in and  respectively 
the liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit obligations increased modestly in to million from million in  due to the negative impact on accumulated liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency translation effect for non us plans 
the company estimates that  based on current actuarial calculations  it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the pension plan in of approximately to million 
cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available 
the company s significant accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products 
allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts  discounts  returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience  current trends and specific information which indicate that an allowance is appropriate 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates average cost  or market 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand 
should future product demand change  existing inventory could become slow moving or obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly 
depreciable assets property  plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions 
historically  the company has not had any significant impairments 
goodwill the company performs its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the company s reporting units  in accordance with fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of each june goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two step approach requiring the company to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value including goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss 
historically  the company has not had any impairments 
the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the company s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december   as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied contractual obligations dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations  and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold  thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company s worldwide operations 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk relative to interest rate risk  the company completed a refinancing of its senior credit facilities during the third quarter as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above 
in conjunction with the refinancing and the funds drawn in conjunction with the tcs acquisition see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the company s libor interest rate on million  million and million of floating rate debt at  and  expiring in december  july and december  respectively 
at december   the company s average libor rate was 
a change in the libor interest rate at december  would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately million 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
