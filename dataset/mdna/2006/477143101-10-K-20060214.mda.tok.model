item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a low fare  low cost passenger airline that provides high quality customer service primarily on point to point routes 
we offer our customers a differentiated product  with new aircraft  low fares  leather seats  up to channels of free livetv and movie selections from fox inflight at every seat  pre assigned seating and reliable performance 
we focus on serving markets that previously were underserved and or metropolitan areas that have had high average fares 
we currently serve destinations in states  puerto rico  the dominican republic and the bahamas  and intend to maintain a disciplined growth strategy 
as of december   we operated flights a day with a fleet of airbus a aircraft and seven embraer aircraft 
we are committed to operating our scheduled flights whenever possible  as we believe our customers highly value completion rate 
although we delivered a completion rate  this philosophy  along with operating at three of the most congested and delay prone domestic airports  contributed to a on time performance in  a decrease of points from  which was lower than all but one major us airline 
the following chart demonstrates our growth

we expect to continue to grow 
as of december   our firm aircraft orders consisted of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft  plus options for an additional airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft 
our growth strategy involves adding additional frequencies on our existing routes  connecting new city pairs among destinations we already serve and entering new markets 
during  we initiated service from new york s john f 
kennedy international airport  or jfk  to boston  ma  burbank  ca  portland  or and ponce  puerto rico 
we also increased our presence in the new york metropolitan market by commencing service from new jersey s newark international airport to fort lauderdale  fort myers  orlando  tampa and west palm beach  fl  and san juan  puerto rico 
in addition  we increased the frequency of service in many of our existing markets 
in january  we commenced service to austin  texas 
we derive our revenue primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft 
passenger revenue was of our operating revenues for the year ended december  revenues generated from international routes accounted for of our total passenger revenues in because all of our fares are nonrefundable  revenue is recognized either when the transportation is provided or after the ticket or customer credit expires 
we measure capacity in terms of available seat miles  which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown 
yield  or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile  is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by revenue passenger miles 
we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by maintaining our high load factor  which is the percentage of aircraft seating capacity that is actually utilized 
based on published fares at our time of entry  our advance purchase fares were often to below those existing in markets prior to our entry  while our walk up fares were generally up to to below the other major us airlines unrestricted full coach fares 
our low fares are designed to stimulate demand  particularly from fare conscious leisure and business travelers who might otherwise have used alternate forms of transportation or would not have traveled at all 
in addition to our regular fare structure  we frequently offer sale fares with shorter advance purchase requirements in most of the markets we serve and match the sale fares offered by other airlines 
other revenue consists primarily of the fees charged to change or cancel customers reservations  the marketing component of trueblue point sales and revenues earned by our subsidiary  livetv  llc  for the sale of  and on going services provided for  in flight entertainment systems sold to other airlines 
during  we launched a cobranded credit card in partnership with american express enabling cardmembers to earn trueblue points that can be redeemed for award flights on jetblue and jetblue getaways  which allows our customers to purchase travel packages including airfare  hotel and car rental 
we have low operating expenses because we operate only two types of aircraft  with high utilization and a single class of service  have a productive workforce  use advanced technologies and have low distribution costs 
the largest components of our operating expenses are salaries  wages and benefits provided to our employees  including provisions for our profit sharing plan  when applicable  and aircraft fuel 
in  fuel prices reached unprecedented high levels resulting in fuel costs becoming our largest operating expense 
the price and availability of aircraft fuel are extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict 
sales and marketing expenses include advertising and fees paid to credit card companies 
our distribution costs tend to be lower than those of most other airlines on a per unit basis because all of our customers book through our website or our agents 
maintenance materials and repairs are expensed when incurred unless covered by a third party services contract 
because the average age of our aircraft is years  all of our aircraft require less maintenance now than they will in the future 
our maintenance costs will increase significantly  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs  as our fleet ages 
other operating expenses consist of purchased services including expenses related to fueling  ground handling  skycap  security and janitorial services  insurance  personnel expenses  professional fees  passenger refreshments  supplies  bad debts  communication costs and taxes other than payroll taxes  including fuel taxes 
the airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the us  with taxes and fees accounting for approximately of the total fare charged to a customer 
airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer 
additionally  if the tsa changes the way the aviation security infrastructure fee is assessed  our security costs may be higher 
our operating margin  which measures operating income as a percentage of operating revenues  was in and in  which were higher than most other major us airlines  according to reports by those airlines 
the highest levels of traffic and revenue on our routes to and from florida are generally realized from october through april  and on our routes to and from the western united states in the summer 
many of our areas of operations in the northeast experience bad weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with deicing aircraft  cancelled flights and accommodating displaced passengers 
our florida routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses to our entry by other airlines 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  this seasonality may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter 
in  several major airlines have reported losses  resulting in the fifth consecutive year of industry losses 
the financial pressures caused by continued losses and record high fuel prices resulted in additional carriers filing for bankruptcy protection 
in september  northwest airlines and delta air lines each filed for bankruptcy protection 
delta air lines announced that in they would cease operating song  the low fare operation which they started in to compete directly with us 
independence air  which initially filed for bankruptcy protection in  ceased operations in january the airlines currently operating in bankruptcy may emerge with substantially lower costs and be able to compete more vigorously 
also in the fall of  two major domestic airlines  us airways and america west  merged  which could enable the combined entity to better compete 
in an effort to become more profitable  in other major airlines shifted some of their domestic capacity to their international routes  where they are better able to include fuel surcharges in their fares 
as our route structure is primarily domestic us  we have been unable to completely recover the increased cost of fuel through fare increases due to the more competitive nature of the domestic airline industry 
we expect the airline industry to remain intensely competitive  especially if adverse economic conditions and high fuel prices persist 
our ability to meet these competitive pressures depends on  among other things  operating at costs equal to or lower than our competitors and providing high quality customer service 
although we have been able to raise capital and continue to grow  the highly competitive nature of the airline industry could prevent us from attaining the passenger traffic or yields required to maintain profitable operations in new and existing markets 
outlook for we expect our operating capacity to increase approximately to over with the addition of new airbus a and embraer aircraft in the embraer is expected to represent of our total estimated available seat miles 
average stage length is expected to decrease in due to the shorter average stage length of the embraer we will incur higher maintenance costs  however  the unit cost increase is expected to be partially offset by our fixed costs being spread over higher projected available seat miles 
fuel costs have risen sharply in and may increase further 
although we have hedged of our anticipated fuel requirements for  we expect to incur higher fuel costs 
assuming fuel prices of per gallon  net of effective hedges  our cost per available seat mile is expected to increase by to over and our operating margin is expected to be between and with an anticipated net loss for the full year 
we took delivery of and placed into revenue service seven embraer aircraft beginning in november the addition of the embraer to our fleet will increase our flexibility and better position us to take advantage of market opportunities 
we intend to capitalize on revenue opportunities that would not have been available to us with only one aircraft type in our fleet  such as establishing non stop service in markets where carriers currently do not provide non stop service 
our completion factor and utilization on this aircraft has been lower than we planned  which was not unexpected for the launch of a new aircraft type 
the operating performance and reliability of these aircraft are expected to improve as we gain additional experience and fully integrate it into our operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which will require us to record stock based compensation expense for all employee stock options and our stock purchase plan using the fair value method beginning in this change will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall cash flow or financial position 
it will also affect our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the difficulty in projecting the stock price used to establish the value of stock options 
we estimate that we will record approximately million in non cash stock based compensation expense in see note to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma impact this standard would have had on our reported financial results 
we have made changes to our compensation strategies to reduce the future impact of this accounting change by shortening vesting periods and eliminating large one time grants 
in addition  sfas no 
r will impact how income taxes are recorded in our financial statements as the tax deduction for certain option grants is only allowed at the time the taxable event takes place  which could cause variability in our effective tax rate through the year as these events occur 
sfas r does not permit companies to predict whether these events will occur 
results of operations the us domestic airline environment continues to be extremely challenging as a result of two predominant factors 
first  is the extremely weak revenue environment caused by widespread price competition and continued increases in industry capacity 
we have encountered aggressive responses from our competitors trying to protect or regain market share through fare matching  price discounts  targeted sale promotions and frequent flyer travel initiatives  all of which are usually matched by other airlines 
the second factor is the record high aircraft fuel prices caused by the sharp rise in crude oil prices 
hurricanes katrina and rita disrupted a significant portion of the oil production and refining operations in and around the gulf of mexico  resulting in unprecedented high fuel prices 
the competitive industry environment  record high fuel prices and increased capacity on the routes we fly  including capacity that was added by us  have all affected our ability to increase fares 
as a result  we experienced a significant reduction in our profitability in year compared to year we had a net loss of million for the year compared to net income of million for the year we had operating income of million  a decrease of million over  and our operating margin was  down points from diluted loss per share was for and diluted earnings per share was for operating revenues 
operating revenues increased  or million  primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
increased passengers resulting from a increase in departures  or million  and a increase in yields  or million  drove the increase in passenger revenue of million for the year additionally  three major hurricanes during the third and fourth quarters resulted in estimated lost revenue of to million 
other revenue increased  or million  primarily due to increased livetv third party revenues of million  increased change fees of million resulting from more passengers and the marketing component of trueblue point sales of million 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased  or million  primarily due to operating an average of additional aircraft  which provided us with higher capacity  and a increase in average fuel price per gallon 
operating capacity increased to billion available seat miles in due to having more average aircraft in service offset by lower utilization of the embraer operating expenses per available seat mile increased to cents 
in detail  operating costs per available seat mile were percent changes are based on unrounded numbers

had fuel prices remained at levels  our cost per available seat mile  or casm  would have only increased by to cents 
the following table reconciles our operating expenses reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  with those that we would have achieved had aircraft fuel prices remained at the levels 
in management s view  comparative analysis of period to period operating results can be enhanced by excluding the significant volatility in the price of aircraft fuel  which is subject to many economic and political factors that are beyond our control  in addition to the impact of hedging activities 
we believe that the presentation of this non gaap financial measure is useful to management and investors because it is more indicative of our ability to manage our costs and also assists in understanding the significant impact that fuel prices have had on our operations 
investors should consider these non gaap financial measures in addition to  and not as a substitute for  our financial performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap

salaries  wages and benefits increased  or million  due primarily to an increase in average full time equivalent employees of in compared to we did not record any profit sharing in compared to million in this decrease was partially offset by the incurrence of million in non cash stock based compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting of million stock options in december the decision to accelerate the vesting of these options was made primarily to avoid recognizing related compensation costs in future consolidated financial statements upon our adoption of sfas no 
r in january all other terms and conditions applicable to such options  including the exercise prices  remain unchanged 
following the acceleration  million  or  of our outstanding options were vested 
cost per available seat mile remained relatively flat as a result of higher wages being offset by lower profit sharing 
aircraft fuel expense increased  or million  due to million more gallons of aircraft fuel consumed resulting in million of additional fuel expense and  even after giving effect to million of fuel hedging gains  a increase in average fuel cost per gallon  or million 
our fuel costs represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
during  aircraft fuel prices remained at historically high levels  with our average fuel price per gallon at compared to in based on our expected fuel volume for  a per gallon increase in the cost of aircraft fuel would increase our annual fuel expense by approximately million 
cost per available seat mile increased due to the increase in average fuel cost per gallon 
landing fees and other rents increased  or million  due to a increase in departures over offset by lower landing fee rates 
cost per available seat mile decreased due to higher capacity and an increase in average stage length 
landing fees and other rents are expected to increase approximately million in as a result of ground rent on our new terminal at jfk  which is under construction 
depreciation and amortization increased  or million  primarily due to having an average of owned aircraft in compared to in cost per available seat mile increased due to a higher percentage of our aircraft fleet being owned and as a result of placing into service our new hangars and training center during aircraft rent increased  or million  due to million in higher rates and million related to new aircraft leases 
cost per available seat mile decreased due to higher capacity and a lower percentage of our fleet being leased 
sales and marketing expense increased  or million  due to higher credit card fees resulting from increased passenger revenues 
on a cost per available seat mile basis  sales and marketing expense increased primarily due to higher credit card fees resulting from higher average fares 
we book all of our reservations through a combination of our website and our agents and in  respectively 
maintenance materials and repairs increased  or million  due to more average aircraft in compared to and a gradual aging of our fleet 
cost per available seat mile increased year over year due to the completion of airframe checks in compared to in  as well as increased engine and component repairs  and is expected to increase significantly as our fleet ages 
effective july   we executed a ten year engine services agreement with mtu covering the scheduled and unscheduled repair of the engines on our airbus a aircraft 
this agreement requires monthly payments to mtu at rates based on number of flight hours each engine was operated during each month 
mtu has assumed the responsibility to repair and overhaul our engines as required during the term of the agreement 
these payments will be expensed as the flight hours are incurred 
this agreement will eliminate the significant judgment in determining estimated costs of overhauls and is expected to result in lower maintenance costs than on a time and materials basis 
other operating expenses increased  or million  primarily due to higher variable costs associated with increased capacity and number of passengers served 
cost per available seat mile increased as a result of increased livetv third party installations  fuel related taxes and services  and a million write off of development costs related to a maintenance and inventory tracking system that will not be implemented 
other income expense 
interest expense increased primarily due to our debt financing of additional aircraft and interest on our million of convertible debt issued in march  resulting in million of additional interest expense  and higher interest rates  which resulted in million of additional interest expense 
interest income increased by million due to higher interest rates 
capitalized interest increased  or million  due to higher predelivery deposit balances and increased rates 
our effective tax rate decreased to in from in the effective tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rate due to the nondeductibility of certain items for tax purposes and the relationship of these items to our pre tax loss of million  which resulted primarily from higher fuel prices 
year compared to year our net income for the year decreased to million from million for the year we had operating income of million  a decrease of million over  and our operating margin was  down points from diluted earnings per share was and for the years ended and  respectively 
our results for included million in emergency war time act compensation which  net of profit sharing and income taxes  amounted to million  or per diluted share 
operating revenues 
operating revenues increased  or million  primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
increased passengers resulting from a increase in departures  or million  partially offset by a decrease in yield  or million  drove the increase in passenger revenue of million for the year lower yields experienced during and a point reduction in load factor were primarily attributable to an extremely competitive environment  which included unprecedented fare discounting and frequent flyer offers by several airlines in most of the markets we serve 
these carriers also added back capacity that was taken out in at the onset of hostilities in iraq  which significantly impacted our east west markets 
additionally  four major hurricanes during the third quarter resulted in estimated lost revenue of to million 
other revenue increased  or million  primarily due to increased change fees of million resulting from more passengers and livetv third party revenues of million 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased  or million  primarily due to operating an average of additional aircraft  which provided us with higher capacity

excludes results of operations and employees for livetv  llc  which are unrelated to our airline operations 
although we have continued to experience significant revenue growth  this trend may not continue 
we expect our expenses to continue to increase significantly as we acquire additional aircraft  as our fleet ages and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets and enter into new markets 
accordingly  the comparison of the financial data for the quarterly periods presented may not be meaningful 
in addition  we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of various factors  many of which are outside our control 
consequently  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and investment securities of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million and investment securities of million at december  we presently have no lines of credit other than two short term borrowing facilities for certain aircraft predelivery deposits 
in september  we renewed and increased the facility for our a deliveries to million and  in december  we entered into a similar agreement for our embraer deliveries for up to million 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
we rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations 
cash flows from operating activities totaled million in  million in  and million in the million decline in cash flows from operations in compared to was primarily a result of a increase in fuel prices  partially offset by a increase in revenue passenger miles 
cash flows from operations in compared to declined due to higher fuel prices and lower yields than in as well as the receipt of million in government compensation in net cash used in investing and financing activities was million in  million in and million in investing activities 
during  capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included expenditures of million for airbus a  one embraer aircraft and three spare engines  million for flight equipment deposits and million for spare part purchases 
capital expenditures for other property and equipment  including ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements  were million 
net cash used in the sale and purchase of available for sale securities was million 
additional cash required for security deposits was million  of which million related to our lease for a new terminal at jfk 
during  capital expenditures related to our purchase of flight equipment included expenditures of million for airbus a aircraft and one spare engine  million for flight equipment deposits and million for spare part purchases 
capital expenditures for other property and equipment  including ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements  were million 
net cash provided from the sale and purchase of available for sale securities was million 
financing activities 
financing activities during consisted primarily of our november public offering of million shares of our common stock at per share  as adjusted for our december three for two stock split  raising net proceeds of million  the sale and leaseback over years of six embraer aircraft for million by a us leasing institution  the financing of airbus a aircraft with in floating rate equipment notes purchased with the proceeds from our november public offering of series pass through certificates  our issuance of a million year fixed rate equipment note issued to a european bank secured by one airbus a aircraft  our march issuance of million of convertible debentures due  raising net proceeds of approximately million  the financing of flight training devices with million in secured loan proceeds from export development canada  the financing of a hangar and training center in orlando  fl with million in special facilities bonds  of which million was received by year end and scheduled maturities of million of debt 
the net proceeds from our common stock and convertible debt offerings are being used to fund working capital and capital expenditures  including capital expenditures related to the purchase of aircraft and construction of facilities on or near airports 
we currently have shelf registration statements on file with the securities and exchange commission related to the issuance of billion original aggregate amount of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and or pass through certificates 
the net proceeds of any securities sold under these registration statements may be used to fund working capital and capital expenditures  including the purchase of aircraft and construction of facilities on or near airports 
through december   we had issued a total of million in securities under these registration statements 
financing activities during consisted primarily of the financing of aircraft with million in floating rate equipment notes purchased with proceeds from our march public offering of pass through certificates  the financing of two aircraft with million of year floating rate equipment notes issued to a european bank  the repayment of three spare engine notes totaling million  scheduled maturities of million of debt  and net short term borrowings of million 
none of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us 
our short term borrowings are part of a floating rate facility with a group of commercial banks to finance aircraft predelivery deposits 
capital resources 
we have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements 
we do not currently have any lines of credit  other than our short term aircraft predelivery deposit facilities  and almost all of our property and equipment is encumbered 
we typically finance our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing 
at december   we operated a fleet of airbus a aircraft  of which are financed under operating leases with the remaining financed by secured debt  and seven embraer aircraft  six of which are financed under operating leases 
the remaining embraer aircraft was financed with secured debt in january financing in the form of secured debt or operating leases had been arranged for of our airbus a aircraft and all of our embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery in although we believe that debt and or lease financing should be available for our remaining aircraft deliveries  we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us  if at all 
while these financings may or may not result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet  our fixed costs will increase significantly regardless of the financing method ultimately chosen 
to the extent we cannot secure financing  we may be required to modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs 
working capital 
we had a working capital deficit of million at december   which is customary for airlines  primarily because air traffic liability is classified as a current liability  compared to positive working capital of million at december  we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  investment securities and internally generated funds  supplemented as necessary by debt and or equity financings and proceeds from aircraft sale and leaseback transactions 
we expect to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue or what the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as continued unprecedented high fuel prices  the impact of airline bankruptcies or consolidations  us military actions  or acts of terrorism 
assuming that we utilize the predelivery short term borrowing facilities available to us and obtain financing for the five remaining a aircraft scheduled for delivery in  we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations our noncancelable contractual obligations at december  include the following in millions

amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services 
all of our debt  other than our convertible debt and notes for one a aircraft  has floating interest rates and had a weighted average maturity of years at december  interest rates adjust quarterly or semi annually based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
under the debt agreements related to two of our aircraft  we are required to comply with two specific financial covenants 
the first requires that our tangible net worth be at least of our total assets 
the second requires  that for each quarter  our ebitda for the prior four quarters must be at least twice our interest expense for those four quarters 
our inability to comply with the required financial maintenance covenants or provisions could result in default under these financing agreements and would result in a cross default under our other financing agreements 
in the event of any such default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default  all amounts outstanding under the agreements could be declared to be immediately due and payable 
if we did not have sufficient available cash to pay all amounts that become due and payable  we would have to seek additional debt or equity financing  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt and lease agreements 
we have significant operating lease obligations for aircraft with initial lease terms that range from to years 
five of these aircraft have variable rate rent payments and adjust semi annually based on libor 
we also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets  as well as office space and other equipment 
we have million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases  million of which will expire in and the remainder at the end of the related lease terms 
our firm aircraft orders at december  consisted of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery as follows in each of  and  in each of and  and in we meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short term borrowing facilities for deposits required six to months prior to delivery 
any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft 
we also have options to acquire additional airbus a aircraft for delivery from through and additional embraer aircraft for delivery from through we can elect to substitute airbus a aircraft or a aircraft for the a aircraft until months prior to the scheduled delivery date for those aircraft not on firm order 
anticipated capital expenditures for facility improvements  spare parts and ground purchases for are projected to be approximately million in the aggregate 
in november  we executed a year lease agreement with the panynj for the construction and operation of a new terminal at jfk with occupancy projected in early  which for financial reporting purposes will be accounted for as a financing obligation 
jetblue has committed to rental payments under the lease  including ground rents for the new terminal site which began on lease execution and are included with lease commitments in the table above 
facility rents are anticipated to commence upon the date of beneficial occupancy and are included with financing obligations and other in the table above 
our commitments also include those of livetv  which has several noncancelable long term purchase agreements with its suppliers to provide equipment to be installed on its customers aircraft  including jetblue s aircraft 
we enter into individual employment agreements with each of our faa licensed employees 
each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five year term unless either the employee or we elect not to renew it 
pursuant to these agreements  these employees can only be terminated for cause 
in the event of a downturn in our business  we are obligated to pay these employees a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits if they do not obtain other aviation employment 
as we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits  no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our balance sheet 
although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are variable interest entities  as defined by fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  none of them require consolidation in our financial statements 
the decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each option and a consideration of our liquidity requirements 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with operating these aircraft  however  we have not made any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors 
we have determined that we hold a variable interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  certain pass through trusts which are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of new aircraft and held by such pass through trusts 
these pass through trusts maintain liquidity facilities whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs 
the liquidity providers for the series certificates are landesbank hessen th ringen girozentrale and morgan stanley capital services inc the liquidity providers for the series certificates are landesbank baden w rttemberg and citibank  na we utilize a policy provider to provide credit support on the class g and class g certificates 
the policy provider has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of interest on the certificates when due and the payment of principal on the certificates no later than months after the final expected regular distribution date 
the policy provider is mbia insurance corporation a subsidiary of mbia  inc 
financial information for the parent company of the policy provider is available at the sec s website at http www 
sec 
gov or at the sec s public reference room in washington  dc we have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our balance sheet  which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies  including guarantees and indemnities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financials statements 
we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
in addition  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
passenger revenue 
passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of air traffic liability 
revenue is recognized when transportation is provided or when a ticket expires  as all of our tickets are non refundable 
upon payment of a change fee  we provide our customers with a credit that is recorded in air traffic liability  which expires months from the date of scheduled travel if not used 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
in estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
our purchased technology  which resulted from our acquisition of livetv in  is being amortized over six years based on the average number of aircraft expected to be in service as of the date of acquisition  resulting in an increasing annual expense as we had commitments at that time to purchase additional aircraft over the next three years 
our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in market value or changes in technology 
as our assets are all relatively new and we continue to have positive cash flow  we have not identified any significant impairments related to our long lived assets at this time 
stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  in will require the recording of stock based compensation expense for issuances under our stock purchase plan and stock option plan over their requisite service period using a fair value approach similar to the current pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r does not mandate an option pricing model to be used in determining fair value  but does require that the model selected consider certain variables 
different models would result in different valuations 
regardless of the method selected  significant judgment is required for some of the valuation variables 
the most significant of these is the volatility of our common stock and the estimated term over which our stock options will be outstanding 
the valuation calculation is sensitive to even slight changes in these estimates 
although there will be no impact to our overall cash flows  the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
most of the stock based compensation expense to be recorded in will relate to our stock purchase plan and stock options expected to be granted in  as we accelerated the vesting of million outstanding stock options in december lease accounting 
we operate airport facilities  offices buildings and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments associated with these agreements recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
within the provisions of certain leases there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term  which includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing 
the amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight line rent expense or their estimated economic life  whichever is shorter 
had different conclusions been reached with respect to the lease term and related renewal periods  different amounts of amortization and rent expense would have been reported 
derivative instruments used for aircraft fuel 
we utilize financial derivative instruments to help manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices 
at december   the net fair value of our derivative instruments was million 
since the majority of our financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  their fair values are estimated  with the assistance of third parties  through the use of present value methods or standard option value models  with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
when possible  we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement 
sfas no 
is a complex accounting standard  requiring that we develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to our fuel hedging program and strategy  statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged ie jet fuel on both a historical and prospective basis and cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed  to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction 
this documentation requires that we estimate forward jet fuel prices since there is no quoted forward market for jet fuel 
these estimates are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices  such as crude oil and or heating oil  and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities 
historically  our hedges have settled within months  therefore  the deferred effective portions of gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time 
frequent flyer accounting 
we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for our trueblue customer loyalty program  which are consistent with industry practices 
we record a liability  which was million as of december   for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel awards  including an estimate for partially earned awards 
the estimated cost includes incremental fuel  insurance  passenger food and supplies  and reservation costs 
in estimating the liability  we currently assume that of earned awards will be redeemed and that of our outstanding points will ultimately result in awards 
periodically  we evaluate our assumptions for appropriateness  including comparison of the cost estimates to actual costs incurred as well as the expiration and redemption assumptions to actual experience 
changes in the minimum award levels or in the lives of the awards would also require us to reevaluate the liability  potentially resulting in a significant impact in the year of change as well as in future years 
we also sell trueblue points to participating partners 
revenue from these sales is allocated between passenger revenues and other revenues 
the amount attributable to passenger revenue is determined based on the fair value of transportation expected to be provided when awards are redeemed and is recognized when travel is provided 
total sales proceeds in excess of the estimated transportation fair value is recognized at the time of sale 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes to the price of fuel and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
variable rate leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
actual results may differ 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
to manage the price risk  we use crude or heating oil option contracts or swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel 
based on projected fuel consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  as of december   we had hedged approximately of our projected fuel requirements 
all existing hedge contracts settle by the end of interest 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
at december   all of our debt  other than our convertible debt and equipment notes for one a aircraft  had floating interest rates 
if interest rates average higher in than they did during  our interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately million  compared to million for measured as of december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt  cash equivalents and investment securities balances at december  and fixed rate debt 
on december   our convertible debt had an aggregate estimated fair value of million  based on quoted market prices 
if interest rates were higher than the stated rate  the fair value of this debt would have been million as of december
