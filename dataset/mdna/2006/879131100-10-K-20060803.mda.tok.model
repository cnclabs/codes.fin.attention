item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction and overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the operating performance and financial condition of tektronix 
a discussion of our business  including our strategy  products  and competition  is included in part i of this form k above 
business overview tektronix is a leading supplier of test  measurement  and monitoring products  solutions  and services to the communications  computer  and semiconductor industries worldwide 
we enable our customers to design  build  deploy  and manage next generation global communications networks  computing  pervasive  and advanced technologies 
we derive revenue principally by developing  manufacturing  and selling a broad range of products and related components  support services  and accessories 
our strategy is to focus our efforts on select product categories where tektronix has a market leadership position or where we believe tektronix can grow to a market leadership position 
we have three supporting strategies to drive long term growth grow market share in core product categories where tektronix already has a strong market position  leverage existing strengths into adjacent product categories  and expand our addressable market 
as a result of investments in this strategy  we believe that near term growth for tektronix will be driven by an increase in the number of products expected to be introduced across the majority of our product categories  and by our ability to win customers in the transition to modern telecommunication networks 
tektronix is organized around two business platforms the instruments business and the communications business 
the instruments business includes general purpose test and measurement products and video test  measurement  and monitoring products 
the communications business includes telecommunications network management solutions and services and network diagnostics products 
we maintain operations and conduct business in four major geographies the americas  europe  the pacific  and japan 
tektronix results of operations and financial condition may be affected by a variety of factors 
in our opinion  the most significant of these factors include the economic strength of the technology markets into which we sell our products  our ability to develop compelling technology solutions and deliver these to the marketplace in a timely manner  and the actions of competitors 
the significant risk factors affecting tektronix are discussed further in item a risk factors of part i of this form k above 
the markets that we serve are very diverse and include a cross section of technology industries 
accordingly  our business is cyclical and tends to correlate to the overall performance of the technology sector 
during the latter part of fiscal year  we began to experience the stabilization of certain markets that had been depressed as a result of the general downturn in the technology sector 
fiscal year saw a more broad based recovery 
during fiscal year  growth rates moderated as compared to the prior fiscal year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and into the first quarter of fiscal year orders softened in a number of our product areas and in most regions 
toward the end of the first quarter of fiscal year  our markets began to strengthen and that strengthening continued through the remainder of fiscal year we face significant competition in many of the markets in which we sell our products 
tektronix competes on many factors including product performance  technology  product availability  and price 
to compete effectively  we must deliver compelling products to the market in a timely manner 
accordingly  we make significant investments into the research and development of new products and the sales channels necessary to deliver products to the market 
even during periods where economic conditions have reduced our revenues  such as those experienced in fiscal years and  we continued to invest significantly in the development of new products and sales channels 
a discussion of our products and competitors is included in item business of part i of this form k above

sony tektronix redemption prior to september   tektronix and sony corporation sony were equal owners of sony tektronix corporation sony tektronix  a joint venture originally established to distribute tektronix products in japan 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we acquired from sony its interest in sony tektronix through redemption of sony s shares by sony tektronix for billion yen  or approximately million at september  this transaction closed on september   at which time we obtained ownership of sony tektronix 
subsequent to the close of this transaction  this subsidiary is referred to as tektronix japan within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this transaction was a 
table of contents long term strategic investment to provide tektronix with stronger access to the japanese market and the ability to leverage the engineering resources in japan 
the transaction was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  beginning on the date of acquisition  the results of operations  financial position  and cash flows of tektronix japan were consolidated in tektronix financial statements 
in fiscal year  acquisition related costs associated with the sony tektronix redemption were not significant 
in fiscal year  we incurred million in costs specifically associated with integrating the operations of this subsidiary  which were largely due to voluntary retention bonuses that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as discussed below 
in fiscal year  we incurred million in costs specifically associated with integrating the operations of this subsidiary  including million for voluntary retention bonuses which we offered to employees in gotemba  japan as an incentive to remain with tektronix while we transitioned japan manufacturing operations to other locations 
accordingly  we began recognizing a liability of approximately million that was accrued ratably over the manufacturing transition period 
the costs described above are included in acquisition related costs credits and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal year  we also restructured the japan pension plans and recorded a net gain from the restructuring of million  sold property located in shinagawa  japan  which resulted in a net gain of million  and recognized an impairment loss of million on assets held for sale located in gotemba  japan 
these net gains and losses are included in acquisition related costs credits and amortization on the consolidated statements of operations 
business realignment costs business realignment costs represent actions to realign our cost structure in response to significant events and primarily include restructuring actions and impairment of assets resulting from reduced business levels or related to significant acquisitions or divestitures 
business realignment actions taken in recent fiscal years were intended to reduce our worldwide cost structure across all major functions 
major operations impacted include manufacturing  engineering  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
in addition to severance  we incurred other costs associated with restructuring our organization  which primarily represented facilities contracts and other exit costs associated with aligning the cost structure to appropriate levels 
restructuring actions can take significant time to execute  particularly if they are being conducted in countries outside the united states 
we believe that the restructuring actions implemented in recent fiscal years have resulted in the cost savings anticipated for those actions 
business realignment costs incurred during fiscal year primarily reflected actions taken in response to softening in orders in some of our product areas at the end of fiscal year and the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year we also took actions to realize business synergies as a result of the acquisition of inet 
business realignment costs of million during fiscal year included severance and related costs of million for employees  million for contractual obligations and a net million credit for currency gains primarily related to the closure of three subsidiaries in europe 
at may   liabilities remained for the severance and related benefits of employees 
business realignment costs of million during fiscal year were primarily for severance and related costs for residual activity in europe 
for fiscal year  business realignment costs included severance and related costs of million for employees  million for contractual obligations  and million for accelerated depreciation of assets  offset by a million credit from net accumulated currency translation gains 
at may   liabilities of million remained for the severance and related benefits of employees for actions taken in fiscal years   and the remaining million liability was for continuing payments on contractual obligations  some of which span several years 
business realignment costs of million in fiscal year included million of severance related costs for employees mostly located in europe and the united states and adjustments to estimates in prior fiscal years  million for accumulated currency translation losses  net  related to the substantial closure of subsidiaries 
table of contents in brazil  australia  denmark and a surplus facility in china  million for contractual obligations for leased facilities in europe and the united states  and million for accelerated depreciation and write down of assets in europe and the united states

significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses include revenue recognition  contingencies  intangible asset valuation  pension plan assumptions  assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies  and stock based compensation assumptions 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
these criteria are met for the majority of our product sales at the time the product is shipped 
upon shipment  we also provide for estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties and for sales returns 
when other significant obligations or acceptance terms remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled or acceptance by the customer has occurred 
contracts for our network management solution products often involve multiple deliverables 
we determine the fair value of each of the contract deliverables using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe for each element of the contract is based on the price for which we sell the element on a stand alone basis 
in addition to hardware and software products  elements of the contracts include product support services such as the correction of software problems  hardware replacement  telephone access to our technical personnel and the right to receive unspecified product updates  upgrades  and enhancements  when and if they become available 
revenues from these services  including post contract support included in initial licensing fees  are recognized ratably over the service 
table of contents periods 
post contract support included in the initial licensing fee is allocated from the total contract amount based on the fair value of these services determined using vsoe 
if we determine that we do not have vsoe on an undelivered element of an arrangement  we will not recognize revenue until all elements of the arrangement that do not have vsoe are delivered 
this occurrence could materially impact our financial results because of the significant dollar amount of many of our contracts and the significant portion of total revenues that a single contract may represent in any particular period 
revenue earned from service is recognized ratably over the contractual service periods or as the services are performed 
shipping and handling costs are recorded as cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
amounts billed or collected in advance of the period in which the related product or service qualifies for revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 
contingencies we are subject to claims and litigation concerning intellectual property  environmental and employment issues  settlement of contingencies related to prior dispositions of assets  and regulatory actions related to customs and export control matters 
accruals have been established based upon our best estimate of the ultimate outcome of these matters 
we review the status of any claims  litigation  and other contingencies on a regular basis  and adjustments are made as additional information becomes available 
as of may   million of contingencies were recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  which included million of contingencies relating to the sale of the color printing and imaging division cpid described below  million for environmental exposures  and million for other contingent liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that our estimates of contingencies could change in the near term and that such changes could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the sale of cpid on january   we deferred the recognition of million of gain on the sale and recorded contingencies of million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  our policy is to defer recognition of a gain where we believe contingencies exist which may result in that gain being recognized prior to realization 
the million of contingencies represented the deferral of a portion of the gain on sale that we believed was not realizable due to certain contingencies contained in the final sale agreement 
of the original million of contingencies  million has been utilized to settle claims and million was recognized in subsequent periods  including million in the third quarter of fiscal year since january   we have analyzed the amount of deferred gain in relation to outstanding contingencies and recognized additional gain periodically when objective evidence indicated that such contingencies were believed to be resolved 
as of may  and may   the balance of the contingencies related to the cpid disposition was million 
this contingency may take several years to resolve 
we continue to monitor the status of the cpid related contingencies based on information received 
included in contingent liabilities was million specifically associated with the closure and cleanup of a licensed hazardous waste management facility at our beaverton  oregon  campus 
the initial liability was established in  and we base ongoing estimates on currently available facts and presently enacted laws and regulations 
costs for tank removal and cleanup were incurred in fiscal year costs currently being incurred primarily relate to ongoing monitoring and testing of the site 
we currently estimate that the range of remaining reasonably possible cost associated with this environmental cleanup  testing and monitoring could be as high as million 
we believe that the recorded liability represents the low end of a reasonable range of estimated liability associated with these environmental issues 
these costs are expected to be incurred over the next several years 
tektronix is currently awaiting approval of a work plan and risk assessment for a feasibility study from the oregon department of environmental quality 
we expect approval for the work plan and risk assessment and completion of the feasibility study during fiscal year  which could increase our recorded liability 
if events or circumstances arise that are unforeseen to us as of the balance sheet date  actual costs could differ materially from the recorded liability 

table of contents the remaining million of contingency accruals included amounts primarily related to intellectual property  employment issues and regulatory matters 
if events or circumstances arise that we did not foresee as of the balance sheet date  actual costs could differ materially from the above described estimates of contingencies 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  but we amortize other acquisition related intangibles with finite useful lives 
sfas no 
requires goodwill not to be amortized  but to be reviewed for impairment annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment test uses a two step process 
the first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
as of may   the balance of goodwill  net was million  which was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
the major component of the goodwill balance was million resulting from the inet acquisition 
for intangible assets with finite useful lives that are not software related  we amortize the cost over the estimated useful lives and assess any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  we may incur charges to impair these assets 
the impairment would be based on the estimated discounted cash flow associated with each asset 
impairment could result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  we fail to deliver new products related to these technology assets  the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable 
for software related intangible assets with finite useful lives  tektronix amortizes the cost over the estimated economic life of the software product and assesses impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
at each balance sheet date  the unamortized cost of the software related intangible asset is compared to its net realizable value 
the net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from the software product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product  including the costs of performing maintenance and customer support 
the excess of the unamortized cost over the net realizable value would then be recognized as an impairment loss 
amortization expense for intangible assets that are software related developed technology is recorded as cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
we do not amortize intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
however  we reevaluate these intangible assets each reporting period 
if we subsequently determine that a nonamortizable intangible asset has a finite useful life  the intangible asset will be written down to the lower of its fair value or carrying amount and then amortized over its remaining useful life on a prospective basis 
we review nonamortizable intangible assets annually for impairment and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset may be impaired 
the impairment test includes a comparison of the fair value of the nonamortizable intangible asset with its carrying value 
an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to continuing operations if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the nonamortizable intangible asset 
the balance of nonamortizable intangible assets of million as of may  resulted primarily from the inet acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal year accordingly  the nonamortizable intangible assets were recorded at their fair values and no events or circumstances have arisen that would indicate that the nonamortizable intangible assets may be impaired 
as of may   we had million of non goodwill intangible assets recorded in other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheets  which includes intangible assets from the acquisition of inet  acquired patent intangibles and licenses for certain technology 

table of contents we perform our annual goodwill and nonamortizable intangible asset impairment test in the second quarter of each fiscal year 
there were no impairment charges associated with goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal years  and pension plans tektronix offers defined benefit pension plan benefits to employees in certain countries 
the cash balance pension plan in the united states is our largest defined benefit pension plan 
employees hired after july  do not participate in the us cash balance pension plan 
we maintain less significant defined benefit plans in other countries including the united kingdom  germany  netherlands  japan  and taiwan 
pension plans are a significant cost of doing business and the related obligations are expected to be settled far in the future 
accounting for defined benefit pension plans results in the current recognition of liabilities and net periodic pension cost over employees expected service periods based on the terms of the plans and the impact of our investment and funding decisions 
the measurement of pension obligations and recognition of liabilities and costs require significant assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the assets of the plan  have had a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we measure pension obligations  fair value of plan assets  and the impact of significant assumptions at the end of each fiscal year 
at may   the accumulated benefit obligation was less than the fair value of plan assets for certain pension plans 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  we recognized a prepaid pension cost asset due to the overfunded accumulated benefit obligation associated with these plans 
other plans remain in underfunded status and are recorded as a pension liability 
at may  the combined total of all tektronix pension plans was in a net underfunded position 
discount rate assumptions are used to measure pension obligations for the recognition of pension liability and prepaid pension cost on the balance sheet  and for the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost 
the discount rates reflect estimates of the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making those estimates  we evaluate rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the settlement of future pension benefits 
the weighted average of discount rates used in determining our pension obligation as of may   was as compared to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
discount rates of and were used as of may  and may   respectively  to determine the projected benefit obligation for the us cash balance pension plan 
the increase in the discount rate contributed to a reduction in the accumulated benefit obligation for the us cash balance plan such that it was less than the fair value of the plan assets  resulting in an overfunded position 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as a result of this overfunded position  we eliminated the associated additional minimum pension liability  eliminated the charge to other comprehensive income  and recognized a prepaid pension cost asset 
the prepaid pension cost asset primarily reflects cumulative unrecognized losses on plan assets  and historical changes in the discount rate and other actuarial assumptions  and is being amortized to the income statement
