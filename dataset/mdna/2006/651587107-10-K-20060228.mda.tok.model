table of contents mmt developments in july  afton completed its review of the mmt fleet study report released by the alliance of automobile manufacturers aam in july with the assistance of environ international corporation  we concluded that the aam study reaffirms that mmt is an acceptable fuel constituent that does not harm vehicle emission control systems 
afton reported these conclusions in a paper presented at the society of automotive engineers sae meeting in october in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
nonetheless  the automotive industry continues to persist in demanding that oil companies discontinue the use of mmt and that governments disallow the use of the product 
the automotive industry has more recently alleged that mmt may cause catalyst plugging in vehicles equipped with the most advanced emission control systems 
however  no credible evidence to support this allegation has been provided by the automobile industry to us 
as part of its ongoing research activities  afton continues to monitor and test mmt compatibility with modern emission control systems and catalysts 
in december  the government of canada released its proposed framework for an independent third party review of new information on the effects of mmt on vehicle emissions 
in its proposal  the canadian government provided no timetable for the commencement or completion of the review 
we believe that this independent third party review of mmt  when properly designed  conducted  and interpreted  will reaffirm that mmt is compatible with modern emission control devices

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to many factors that could materially adversely affect our future performance and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k 
those risk factors are outlined below 
competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we face intense competition in certain of the product lines and markets in which we compete 
we expect that our competitors will develop and introduce new and enhanced products  which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of certain products we produce 
in addition  as a result of price competition  we may be compelled to reduce the prices for some of our products  which could adversely affect our margins and profitability 
competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers 
our inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
in addition  some of our competitors may have greater financial  technological  and other resources than we have 
some of our competitors may also be able to maintain greater operating and financial flexibility than we are able to maintain 
as a result  these competitors may be able to better withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices for raw materials  and changes in general economic conditions 
sudden or sharp raw materials price increases may adversely affect our profit margins 
we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  maleic anhydride  olefin copolymers  antioxidants  alcohols  and methacrylates 
our 
table of contents profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products 
availability of raw materials and transportation systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the chemical industry and transportation industry are in a situation where supply and demand is in balance 
any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials or transportation systems 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our reliance on a small number of significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our principal customers are major multinational oil companies 
the oil industry is characterized by concentration of a few large participants as a result of recent consolidation 
two of our customers individually accounted for more than of our net sales in net sales for that period to bp plc and its affiliates amounted to million of total net sales  and net sales to royal dutch shell plc and its affiliates amounted to million of total net sales 
the loss of either of these customers  or a material reduction in purchases from either of them  or from any other large or significant customer  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
our customers are concentrated in the lubricant and fuel industries and  as a result  our reliance on that industry is significant 
most of our customers are primarily engaged in the fuel and lubricant industries 
this concentration of customers affects our overall risk profile  since our customers will be similarly affected by changes in economic  geopolitical  and industry conditions 
many factors affect the level of our customers spending on our products  including  among others  general business conditions  changes in technology  interest rates  gasoline prices  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
a sudden or protracted downturn in these industries could adversely affect the buying power and purchases by our customers 
we may be unable to respond effectively to technological changes in our industry 
our future business success will depend upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
our industry is characterized by frequent changes in industry performance standards  which affect the amount and timing of our research and development costs and other technology related costs 
as a result  the life cycle of our products is often hard to predict 
further  technological changes in some or all of our customers products or processes may make our products obsolete 
any inability to anticipate  respond to or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow in any given period 
our tel business has declined and will continue to decline 
historically  tel  an octane enhancer in leaded gasoline used to improve ignition qualities and operating performance of fuel  has been a material component of our product line 
however  during the s  the 
table of contents implementation of the federal clean air act led to the use of catalytic converters that are deemed no longer compatible with leaded gasoline  and unleaded gasoline became the fuel standard in the united states with other countries following 
as a result  our tel financial results have declined 
the tel segment represented approximately of our segment operating profit 
we expect that the market for tel will continue to decline going forward  and may decline with unpredictable volatility and severity 
our tel results would be adversely affected if octel did not comply with the terms of the marketing agreements 
results of our tel segment include the operating profit contribution from our marketing agreements with octel  which is now the only manufacturer of tel worldwide 
under our marketing agreement with octel  we receive of the net proceeds from the sale of tel by octel in all regions of the world  except north america  as well as certain tel operations not included in the marketing agreements 
as a result  our tel results would be adversely affected if octel did not comply with the terms of the marketing agreements 
several of our products are produced solely at one facility  and a significant disruption or disaster at such a facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
several of the products we produce or sell are produced only in one location 
we are dependent upon the continued safe operation of those production facilities 
those production facilities are subject to various hazards associated with the manufacture  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  unscheduled downtime  and environmental hazards 
some of our products involve the manufacture and handling of a variety of reactive  explosive and flammable materials 
many of these hazards could cause a disruption in the production of our products 
we cannot assure you that these facilities will not experience these types of hazards and disruptions in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in any given period 
we face risks related to our foreign operations that may negatively affect our business 
in  net sales to customers outside north america accounted for approximately of total net sales 
we do business in all major regions of the world  some of which do not have stable economies or governments 
in particular  we sell and market products in countries experiencing political and economic instability in the middle east  asia pacific  and latin america 
our international operations are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political conditions  expropriation  import and export restrictions  increases in royalties  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  taxes  government royalties  inflationary economies and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies such as restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
the occurrence of any one or a combination of these factors may increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our business 
we face risks related to our foreign operations which may adversely affect our results of operations 
we conduct our business in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of each of our foreign operating subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign 
table of contents currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales  cost of goods sold  and operating margins 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollars 
exchange rates between these currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods  compounds  and other technologies is important to our business 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our intellectual property rights to distinguish our products from those of our competitors 
failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or having to pay other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law as well as judicial enforcement to protect such technologies 
we currently own approximately  issued us and foreign patents  with a significant number of additional patents pending 
some of these patents are licensed to others 
in addition  we have acquired the rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses 
we also have several hundred trademark registrations throughout the world for our marks  including ethyl  mmt  hitec  and greenburn  as well as pending trademark applications  including newmarket and afton chemical 
we cannot assure you that the measures taken by us to protect these assets and rights will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented  or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that any pending patent application filed by us will result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  that those patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
the failure of our patents or other measures to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise  methods  and compounds could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 
our business is subject to government regulation  and could be adversely affected by future governmental regulation 
we are subject to regulation by local  state  federal  and foreign governmental authorities 
in some circumstances  before we may sell certain products  these authorities must approve these products  our manufacturing processes  and facilities 
we are also subject to ongoing reviews of our products  manufacturing processes  and facilities by governmental authorities 

table of contents in order to obtain regulatory approval of certain new products  we must  among other things  demonstrate to the relevant authority that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product in accordance with current regulations 
the process of seeking approvals can be costly  time consuming  and subject to unanticipated and significant delays 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted to us on a timely basis  or at all 
any delay in obtaining  or any failure to obtain or maintain  these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to generate net sales from those products 
new laws and regulations may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs  seizures  confiscation  recall or monetary fines  any of which could prevent or inhibit the development  distribution  and sale of our products 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  and recalls or seizures  any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
political  economic and regulatory factors concerning one of our primary products  mmt  could adversely affect our sales of mmt 
the epa studied mmt and determined that it does not cause or contribute to the failure of vehicle emission systems 
the canadian government has made similar findings 
however  the epa is requiring additional testing to fill some data gaps  including potential risks to public health  and a change in current determinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  certain industry groups are urging greater regulation of all metal based gasoline additives  including mmt 
in  aam issued a fleet test report on mmt based on tests conducted by the aam  the association of international automobile manufacturers  and the canadian vehicle manufacturers association 
the report alleges that mmt significantly raises vehicle emissions  increases fuel emissions  increases fuel consumption  and impairs the proper operation of vehicle emission control systems 
in december  the government of canada released its proposed framework for an independent third party review of new information on the effects of mmt on vehicle emissions 
in its proposal  the canadian government provided no timetable for the commencement or completion of the review 
substantially all of our customers in canada have suspended the use of mmt  pending the results of the government of canada sponsored independent third party review 
to date  the government of canada has not initiated the review 
we expect that the european union will also review all metal based petroleum additives  including mmt  for their impact on pollution abatement technology 
increased government regulation of mmt if it occurs or additional studies evaluating mmt  even if government regulation does not occur  could have a material adverse effect on our sales of that product 
legal proceedings and other claims could impose substantial costs on us 
we are involved in numerous administrative and legal proceedings that result from  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
from time to time  these proceedings involve environmental  product liability  lead  and premises asbestos liability and other matters 
see item  legal proceedings 
we have insurance coverage that we believe would be available to mitigate potential damages in many of these proceedings 
however  there is no assurance that our available insurance will cover these claims  that our insurers will not challenge coverage for certain claims or that final damage awards will not exceed our available insurance coverage 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
environmental matters could have a substantial negative impact on our results of operations 
as a manufacturer and distributor of chemical products  we are generally subject to extensive local  state  federal  and foreign environmental  safety and health laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to land and water  the generation  handling  treatment and disposal 
table of contents of hazardous waste and other materials  and remediation of contaminated soil  surface and ground water 
our operations entail the risk of violations of those laws and regulations  many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
we believe our operations are currently in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations 
however  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements 
in addition  these requirements  and the enforcement or interpretation of these requirements  may become more stringent in the future 
although we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements  the costs could be material 
non compliance could subject us to material liabilities  such as government fines  damages arising from third party lawsuits or the suspension and potential cessation of non compliant operations 
we may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost 
future developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of or require us to make modifications to our products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
at any given time  we are involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings  and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage  and personal injury 
we cannot assure you that the resolution of these environmental matters will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
some of our properties contain  or may have contained in the past  on site facilities or underground tanks for the storage of chemicals  hazardous materials  and waste products that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances or contamination of the environment 
the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
we may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury  product liability or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances  such as premises asbestos  at or from our facilities 
we may also face liability for personal injury  product liability  property damage  natural resource damage or clean up costs for the alleged migration of contaminants or hazardous substances from our facilities or for future accidents or spills 
a significant increase in the number or success of these claims could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
for further discussion of some related claims  see item  business environmental 
the ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict 
liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
a liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site  whether currently or formerly owned or operated regardless of fault  knowledge  timing of the contamination  cause of the contamination  percentage of contribution to the contamination or the legality of the original disposal 
we could incur significant costs  including clean up costs  natural resource damages  civil or criminal fines and sanctions  and third party claims  as a result of past or future violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws 
we have been identified  and in the future may be identified  as a prp in connection with state and federal laws regarding environmental clean up projects 
we are subject to the federal superfund law and similar state laws under which we may be designated as a prp 
as a prp  we may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up hazardous waste sites  such as a landfill to which we may have sent waste 
see item  business environmental 
our financial results will vary according to the timing of customer orders and other external factors  which reduces your ability to gauge our performance 
our business can be characterized by significant quarterly swings in shipments and profits 
external factors beyond our control  such as customer orders  product shipment dates and other factors can cause 
table of contents shifts in net sales and income from quarter to quarter 
these external factors can magnify the impact of industry cycles 
as a result  our income and cash flow may fluctuate significantly on a quarter to quarter basis  and your ability to gauge trends in our business may be impaired 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our senior credit agreement and senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants may constrain our activities and limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production or our transportation systems and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling  and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations  and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
we could be required to make additional contributions to our pension funds  which may be under funded due to recent and any future under performance of the equities markets 
our pension plan asset allocation is predominantly weighted towards equities 
cash contribution requirements to our pension plans are sensitive to changes in our plans expected return on assets 
reductions in our plans expected return on assets due to poor performance of the equities markets could cause our pension plans to be under funded and require us to make additional cash contributions 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption  and casualty insurance  but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including domestic and international terrorist attacks  may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states and throughout the world 
federal legislation is under consideration that could impose significant new site security requirements specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities that may increase our overhead expenses 
federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct 
table of contents attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive

this facility is currently operating as a terminal location providing storage  blending  and distribution of petroleum additives 
item legal proceedings we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to our business and include administrative or judicial actions seeking remediation under environmental laws  such as superfund 
these proceedings include certain product liability cases 
the only product liability cases of potential consequence in which we are involved are tel related 
in one case  ethyl was served as a defendant in a case filed in the circuit court for baltimore city  maryland  in september smith  et al 
v 
lead industries association  inc  et al  alleged personal injuries for seven children from lead exposure arising from lead paint and dust from tailpipe emissions due to leaded gasoline 
the court dismissed ethyl and some other defendants from the case in february and granted summary judgment to other defendants in november the plaintiffs have appealed both decisions  but did not appeal the dismissal of ethyl as a defendant 
the court of special appeals of maryland reversed the trial court s decision in part  but noted in its decision that the claims 
table of contents related to tailpipe emissions the only claims concerning ethyl had not been appealed 
the court of appeals of maryland reversed the trial court s dismissal of the claims on appeal and remanded the case to the trial court 
if such claims are further pursued against ethyl  we believe ethyl has strong defenses and will vigorously defend any such claims 
like many other companies  we are also a defendant in personal injury lawsuits involving exposure to asbestos 
these cases involve exposure to asbestos in premises owned or operated  or formerly owned or operated  by subsidiaries of newmarket 
we have never manufactured  sold  or distributed products that contain asbestos 
nearly all of these cases are pending in texas  louisiana  or illinois and involve multiple defendants 
we maintain an accrual for these proceedings  as well as a receivable for expected insurance recoveries 
during the second quarter  we entered into an agreement with travelers indemnity company travelers resolving certain long standing issues regarding our coverage for certain premises asbestos claims 
in addition  our agreement with travelers provides a procedure for allocating defense and indemnity costs with respect to certain future premises asbestos claims 
the lawsuit we had previously filed against travelers in the southern district of texas was dismissed 
we also settled our outstanding receivable from albemarle for certain premises asbestos liability obligations 
as a result of the insurance settlement described above  the outstanding amount owed to us by albemarle was adjusted to million  compared to million at year end albemarle paid us million in the third quarter of these settlements resulted in an aggregate gain of million which is included as a special item for the net gain represents amounts paid to us to settle historical claims in excess of the receivables we carried on our financial statements from both travelers and albemarle in the aggregate 
the accrual for our premises asbestos liability related to currently asserted claims is based on the following assumptions and factors we are often one of many defendants 
this factor influences both the number of claims settled against us and also the indemnity cost associated with such resolutions 
the estimated percent of claimants in each case that will actually  after discovery  make a claim against us  out of the total number of claimants in a case  is based on a level consistent with past experience and current trends 
we utilize average comparable plaintiff cost history as the basis for estimating pending premises asbestos related claims 
these claims are filed by both former contractors employees  and former employees who worked at past and present company locations 
we also include an estimated inflation factor in the calculation 
no estimate is made for unasserted claims 
the estimated recoveries from insurance and albemarle for these cases are based on  and are consistent with  the settlement agreements 
based on the above assumptions  we have provided an undiscounted liability related to premises asbestos claims of million at both year end and year end the liabilities related to asbestos claims are included in accrued expenses current portion and other noncurrent liabilities on the balance sheet 
certain of these costs are recovered through our insurance coverage and agreement with albemarle 
the receivable for these recoveries related to premises asbestos liabilities was million at december  and million at december  these receivables are included in trade and other accounts receivable for the current portion 
the noncurrent portion is included in other assets 

table of contents in december  afton was sued by a competitor  infineum international ltd 
and infineum usa lp  in federal court in delaware 
the suit alleges patent infringement of one patent in connection with some lubricant additive packages 
afton believes it has strong defenses and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit 
while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of any legal proceeding  we believe that we have adequate accruals  cash  and insurance coverage such that the adverse outcome of these legal proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  would not result in a material adverse effect on us

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation forward looking statements the following discussion contains forward looking statements about future events and expectations within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future results 
when we use words in this document  such as anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  expects  and similar expressions  we do so to identify forward looking statements

overview the year was a good year for newmarket corporation and included many achievements and continuing challenges 
petroleum additives net sales surpassed the billion mark while achieving improved earnings in a very competitive market 
we have paid off all of our bank debt in and have begun building cash for future opportunities  resulting in the upgrading of our credit rating during the year by standard poors rating service 
tel continued its expected decline in profits and volumes 
we enter with many challenges facing our business including the continuing  rising cost of raw materials in our petroleum additives operations and the decline in demand for tel around the world 
as we look forward  we expect tel will earn less in than in and will continue to be a declining contributor to the profit of the corporation 
we expect that petroleum additives will earn more in than in  as we continue to bring value added solutions to our customers 
results of operations net sales continuing the trend from last year  net sales increased in essentially all areas of the petroleum additives segment 
in addition  total consolidated net sales were higher in than in either or when comparing with  net sales increased 
the increase between and was 
in   and  net sales to two customers of our petroleum additives segment exceeded of total net sales 
sales to bp plc and its affiliates amounted to million of total net sales in  
table of contents million of total net sales in  and million of total net sales in sales to royal dutch shell plc and its affiliates amounted to million of total net sales in  million of total net sales in  and million of total net sales in these net sales represent a wide range of products sold to these two customers in multiple regions of the world 
no other single customer accounted for or more of our total net sales in   or the following table shows our net sales by segment for each of the last three years 
net sales by segment in millions of dollars petroleum additives tetraethyl lead consolidated net sales petroleum additives our petroleum additives sales improved over both and petroleum additives net sales for increased million  or  over levels 
the increase was across all product lines 
shipments were approximately higher than in with the increase predominantly in the engine oil additives product line 
there were smaller increases in industrial additives and fuel additives product lines 
price increases and a favorable foreign currency impact also contributed to the higher net sales 
when comparing to  petroleum additives net sales were up million  or  reflecting improvements across all product lines 
shipments  driven by the engine oil additives product line  were higher across all product lines resulting in an improvement of about in total shipments 
strengthening of foreign currency  primarily the euro  also had a beneficial impact on net sales 
the approximate components of the petroleum additives increase in net sales of million when comparing to and million when comparing and are shown below in millions 
net sales for year ended december  increase in shipments and changes in product mix changes in selling prices including foreign currency impact net sales for year ended december  increase in shipments and changes in product mix changes in selling prices including foreign currency impact net sales for year ended december  tetraethyl lead most of the tel marketing activity is through the agreements with octel  under which we do not record the sales transactions 
therefore  the tel net sales shown above are those made by ethyl in areas not covered by the marketing agreements  as well as sales made to octel under the terms of the agreements 
the sales made in areas not covered by the marketing agreements are very minor compared to the tel sales made through the marketing agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tel net sales in areas not covered by the marketing agreements have generally remained unchanged for the last three years 
there were no sales to octel during or sales made to octel in were million 

table of contents segment operating profit newmarket evaluates the performance of afton s petroleum additives business and ethyl s tel business based on segment operating profit 
newmarket services departments and other expenses are billed to afton and ethyl based on the services provided under the holding company structure 
depreciation on segment property  plant  and equipment  and amortization of segment intangible assets and the prepayments for services are included in the operating profit of each segment 
the table below reports operating profit by segment for the last three years 
the other classification in the table below primarily represents certain manufacturing operations that ethyl provides to afton 
segment operating profit in millions of dollars petroleum additives tetraethyl lead other petroleum additives petroleum additives operating profit for was approximately million  an increase of million  or  over the increases were primarily in the engine oil additives  industrial additives  and fuel additives product lines 
while net sales of our remaining fuel additives products also increased  higher raw material costs caused operating profit from these products to be considerably lower in than last year 
overall  the increase in operating profit resulted from higher net sales and higher shipments 
for  the impact of the increases in selling prices that we were able to achieve during the year just about covered the increases in raw material costs for  with higher shipments accounting for most of the improved profitability 
in addition  combined selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a  including research  development  and testing expenses r d increased slightly during the year 
both and results include a favorable foreign currency impact  primarily from the euro 
the results also include a gain of about million from an environmental insurance settlement 
petroleum additives operating profit for decreased million  or  when compared to the level of million 
the results include a small improvement in the engine oil additives product line and lower results in the other areas 
while both net sales and shipments improved  the rising costs of raw materials  as well as higher sg a expenses and r d expenses  resulted in the reduction in operating profit compared to although the impact of higher selling prices favorably impacted the operating profit  the price increases we achieved did not cover the increase in raw material costs 
the results include a gain of thousand related to the implementation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
total r d expenses were million in both and  and million in while our r d expenses were the same in both and  the projects and product lines that were researched were quite different 
this is normal for our business and is a function of industry specifications  customers expectations  and competitive forces 
the increase when comparing and is across all product lines  but mainly in the engine oil additives  industrial additives  and driveline additives product lines 
there was also a small unfavorable foreign currency impact across all years 
r d related to new products and processes was million in  million in  and million in all of our r d expenses were related to the petroleum additives segment 
sg a in for this segment was approximately million higher than  while was approximately million higher than the increases in both and included the impact of an

tetraethyl lead results of our tel segment include the operating profit contribution from our marketing agreements and certain tel operations not included in the marketing agreements 
the operating profit contribution from our marketing agreements was million in  million in  and million in as expected  volumes shipped declined when comparing both to and to volumes were lower for compared to and lower when comparing and pricing did improve when comparing and in addition  amortization of the prepayment for services was approximately million lower in than in  reflecting the declining balance method of amortization 
these improvements were not enough to offset the decrease in shipments 
the decrease in volumes shipped in was primarily the result of one of the major tel customers under the marketing agreement discontinuing use of the product 
when comparing and  the decrease in volumes shipped was more than offset by improved pricing and lower costs 
included in the lower costs was a reduction of million in amortization of prepayment for services when comparing to see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the tel marketing agreements 
the tel market will continue to decline as customers discontinue use of the product 
the loss from other tel operations that was not a part of the marketing agreements was approximately million unfavorable when comparing to and million favorable when comparing to the large variances are primarily due to the insurance settlements 
the results include a special item of million for insurance settlement gain related to our premises asbestos liabilities 
the results include a special item gain of million from an environmental insurance settlement  while the results include income of million resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
when comparing and  the other tel operations results include lower premises asbestos charges reflecting the favorable impact of a change in expected future insurance reimbursements 
the favorable impact from the premises asbestos items in was partially offset by an increase in environmental clean up costs 
the combined environmental and premises asbestos charges during were approximately even with the profits benefited from tel inventory sales to octel  which were approximately million 
neither nor included earnings from the sale of tel inventory to octel 
the following discussion references certain captions on the consolidated statements of income 
special item income special item income was million in and included an aggregate million of gains on the sales of corporate property and a million gain on an insurance settlement related to our premises asbestos liabilities discussed below 
during the second quarter  we entered into an agreement with travelers resolving certain long standing issues regarding our coverage for certain premises asbestos claims 
in addition  our agreement with travelers provides a procedure for allocating defense and indemnity costs with respect to future premises asbestos claims 
the lawsuit we had previously filed against travelers in the southern district of texas was dismissed 
we also settled our outstanding receivable from albemarle for premises asbestos liability obligations 
as a result of the insurance settlement described above  the outstanding amount owed to us by albemarle was adjusted to million  compared to million at year end albemarle paid us million in the third quarter of 
table of contents the net gain of million in represents amounts paid to us to settle historical claims in excess of the receivables we carried on our financial statements from both travelers and albemarle in the aggregate 
this amount is reflected in tel segment operating profit as discussed above 
special item income was million in and represents the gain on an environmental insurance settlement 
the terms of the settlement provide for a total payment of million 
in addition to the million received during  we received million in february and the remaining million in february in accordance with a previously agreed upon payment schedule 
interest and financing expenses interest and financing expenses were million in  million in  and million in lower average debt when comparing to resulted in a million reduction in interest and financing expenses  while higher average interest rates resulted in increased expenses of thousand 
fees and amortization of financing costs were thousand lower for lower average debt during compared to resulted in a million reduction in interest and financing expenses  while lower amortization and fees contributed a benefit of million 
partially offsetting these was a higher average interest rate resulting in an increase in expense of million 
other income  net other income  net for was thousand  while was thousand income 
both years were comprised of a number of small items 
other income  net for was thousand income and included a million refund from an insurance company related to employee benefit policies 
income tax expense income tax expense on continuing operations was million in  million in  and million in the effective tax rate was in  in  and in the effective tax rate in each year reflects certain foreign and other tax benefits 
the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes from to resulted in the full million increase in taxes between the two years 
the effective tax rate between the two years was essentially unchanged 
the rate includes the favorable impact of approximately million from the settlement of certain open tax years with the internal revenue service 
the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes from to resulted in an increase of million in income taxes in this was partially offset by a million decrease resulting from the lower effective tax rate 
the lower effective tax rate in compared to includes the benefit of reaching agreement with the internal revenue service on settlement of certain open tax years  as well as lower state income taxes 
to comply with international trade rules  the american jobs creation act of  signed into law on october   repealed the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of the provision repealed the extraterritorial income exclusion for transactions entered into after december  subject to a phase out that allowed current beneficiaries to claim benefits in and in  the benefit of excluding million from taxable income was of the amount calculated under prior law 
in  the benefit will be of the amount calculated under prior law 
for and beyond  no benefit will be allowed 
our deferred taxes are in a net asset position and based on forecast operating plans  we believe that we will recover the full benefit of our deferred tax assets

table of contents income from operations of discontinued business following an extensive assessment of our phenolic antioxidant business  we concluded this business was not part of our future core business or growth goals 
accordingly  after approval by the board of directors in december  on january   we completed the sale of our phenolic antioxidant business to albemarle 
as part of the transaction  we sold accounts receivable and inventory  as well as property  plant  and equipment at our orangeburg  south carolina facility 
the discontinued operations reflected in our consolidated statements of income is the after tax gain on the disposal of the business of million million before tax 
cumulative effect of accounting change as discussed above in the segment operating profit section  during first quarter  we recognized a gain of million million after tax on the implementation of sfas no

table of contents included in our results in the sg a expense line of our consolidated statements of income is a decrease of approximately million in corporate expenses 
this decrease in includes the impact of the cost of establishing the holding company in partially offset by a one time charge of thousand related to a foreign postretirement benefit plan 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
when comparing and  there was an increase in corporate  general  and administrative expenses of million 
the major components of this increase are legal expenses associated with the establishment of the holding company and costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley legislation 
the cost of our pensions is also a factor in comparing our earnings results from year to year 
pension expense on a pre tax basis was million higher in than and million higher in than in due primarily to changes in rate assumptions 
cash flows discussion we generated cash from operating activities of million in  million in  and million in in  we realized million in before tax proceeds from the sales of corporate assets 
we used these proceeds  as well as the cash flows from operating activities  to fund capital expenditures of million and pay off our outstanding bank debt of million 
our book overdrafts decreased million 
these items resulted in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash and cash equivalents at december  included a million negative impact from foreign currency 
included in the cash flows from operating activities were collections of million related to the environmental insurance settlement  which provides for a total payment of million million of which we received in  million of which we received in and million of which we received in february in accordance with a previously agreed upon payment schedule and million from the insurance settlement related to our premises asbestos liabilities  as well as payments of million to fund our pension plans

in addition  cash flows from operating activities included cash outlays of approximately million to fund certain of our pension plans 
during  we generated before tax proceeds of million from the sale of the phenolic antioxidant business  as well as proceeds of million from the sale of certain other assets 
we used these proceeds  along with the cash generated from operations  to pay million in debt issuance costs  fund capital expenditures of million  and make the final payment of million to octel for tel marketing agreements services 
in addition  we made a net repayment on debt of million and increased cash and cash equivalents million 
our book overdraft increased million 
our cash from operations included million received from a lawsuit settlement 
this settlement was related to the recovery of operating costs of million  as well as interest income on the settlement of million 
cash from operations of about million was used to fund certain of our pension plans 
we expect that cash from operations  together with borrowing available under our credit facility  will continue to be sufficient to cover our operating expenses and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
financial position and liquidity we reduced our debt million in  million in  and million in this comes after having reduced the debt by million in and million in the reduction in debt during 
table of contents leaves us with no bank debt drawn under our bank facility 
our debt position has improved substantially since  and we are now in a leverage range where debt reduction is no longer a priority 
we have begun building cash as we continue to review other options for the use of that cash 
cash at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at the end of we also had restricted cash of million at december  and million at december  of these funds at december   thousand was cash received from metropolitan life insurance company metropolitan during and these funds amounted to million at december  the funds from metropolitan are being used to reduce the employee portion of retiree health benefit costs 
the remaining thousand of restricted cash at december  represents funds related to the issuance of a european bank guarantee 
this guarantee amounted to thousand at december  at both december  and december   we had a book overdraft for some of our disbursement cash accounts 
a book overdraft represents disbursements that have not cleared the bank accounts at the end of the reporting period 
we transfer cash on an as needed basis to fund these items as they clear the bank in subsequent periods 
debt senior notes on april   ethyl sold senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million that bear interest at a fixed rate of and are due in the senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by all of our existing and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and certain of our existing wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
we incurred financing costs of approximately million related to the senior notes  which are being amortized over seven years 
in connection with the holding company formation  effective june   newmarket assumed all of ethyl s rights  liabilities and obligations under the senior notes 
the senior notes and the subsidiary guarantees rank effectively junior to all of our and the guarantors existing and future secured indebtedness  including any borrowings under the senior credit facility described below  equal in right of payment with any of our and the guarantors existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness  and senior in right of payment to any of our and the guarantors existing and future subordinated indebtedness 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends or repurchase capital stock  make certain investments  
table of contents sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
we were in compliance with the covenants in the senior notes as of both december  and december  senior credit facility on april   we entered into a long term debt structure for ethyl 
the debt structure included the senior notes discussed above and a senior credit facility with a bank term loan and a revolving credit facility 
on june   prior to the completion of the holding company formation  ethyl entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  which consists of a million revolving credit facility 
this agreement amended and restated the credit agreement that ethyl had entered into on april  effective with the completion of the holding company formation  newmarket assumed all of ethyl s rights and obligations under the amended and restated credit agreement pursuant to the first amendment thereto 
we incurred additional financing costs of approximately million  which resulted in total deferred financing costs of approximately million related to the amended and restated credit facility 
these costs are being amortized over five years 
the million revolver is for working capital and other general corporate purposes for newmarket and our subsidiaries and includes a sub facility for letters of credit 
borrowings bear interest  at our election  at either a base rate plus a margin basis points as of december  or libor plus a margin basis points as of december  
the revolving credit facility matures on june  there were no borrowings outstanding at december  under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  resulting in the unused portion of the revolver amounting to million 
the revolving credit facility is secured by liens on substantially all of our us assets 
in addition  the credit facility is guaranteed by our us subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries to the extent that such guarantees would not result in adverse tax consequences 
the credit agreement contains covenants  representations  and events of default that management considers typical of a credit agreement of this nature 
the financial covenants include minimum consolidated net worth  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio  a maximum senior secured leverage ratio  and restrictions on the payment of dividends or repurchases of capital stock 
we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility as of both december  and december  we had combined current and noncurrent long term debt of million at december   representing a net reduction of million in our total debt since december  the net reduction in debt represents the pay off of our bank debt under the revolving credit agreement 
we also paid thousand on the capital lease obligations 
during  we paid down total debt by million 
the net reduction in debt represents the pay off of million on the term loan  as well as a decrease of thousand on the capital lease obligations 
these 
table of contents reductions were partially offset by the net borrowing of million on the revolving credit facility 
all of our debt is discussed more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of total capitalization total long term debt and shareholders equity  our total debt decreased from at the end of to at the end of the decrease reflects the reduction in total debt  as well as the increase in shareholders equity due to earnings 
normally  we repay long term debt with cash from operations  as well as with proceeds from occasional sales of business units  plant sites  or other assets 
working capital at december   we had working capital of million  resulting in a current ratio which is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities of to our working capital at year end was million resulting in a current ratio of to the increase in working capital primarily reflects a higher cash level and higher accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to higher sales levels  reflecting both increased volumes shipped and higher prices 
partially offsetting these were an increase in accounts payable  mostly driven by higher raw material prices and the timing of services and products received  as well as increases in accrued expenses and income taxes payable 
the increase in accrued expenses is primarily the result of higher current environmental remediation costs and customer rebates 
the increase in income taxes payable is primarily due to higher current year taxable income 
capital expenditures we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in we expect capital spending for environmental and safety projects will be approximately million to million in due to modifications needed at our facilities to meet the miscellaneous organic natural emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants regulation 
we expect to continue to finance capital spending through cash provided from operations  together with borrowing available under our senior credit facility 
sale leaseback transaction in june  we entered into a sale leaseback transaction for the land  buildings  and certain equipment located at our bracknell  england facility 
we received million for the assets  which had a net book value of million 
the resulting operating lease is for ten years with an option to terminate the lease after five years 
the gain of million was deferred and is being amortized over the term of the lease agreement 
environmental expenses we spent approximately million in  million in  and million in for environmental operating and clean up costs  excluding depreciation of previously capitalized expenditures 
of these amounts  the ongoing costs of operations were million in both and and million in the balance represents clean up  or remediation and monitoring costs 
these environmental operating and clean up expenses are included in cost of goods sold 
in  we expect environmental operating and remediation costs to be about the same as further  we expect to continue to fund these costs through cash provided by operations

amounts include asset retirement obligations and contributions associated with pension and postretirement benefit plans 
amounts accrued for the potential exposure with respect to litigation  claims  and assessments are not included in the table above 
under the tel marketing agreements with octel  we are required to provide approximately one third of the cost of product sold to customers in the territory from our inventory or post an equivalent dollar value deposit with octel 
the value of our available inventory fell below the requirement at year end and was substantially depleted at year end as it was utilized for sales under the agreements 
the dollar value requirement was million at december  and million at december  we now cover this requirement of the marketing agreements through the value of a working capital advance to octel 
this advance is being repaid to us as the requirement decreases and will be paid in full at the end of the agreements 
these amounts have been recorded in other assets and deferred charges 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we apply sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas to account for our pension and postretirement plans 
we use a december measurement date to determine our pension and postretirement expenses and related financial disclosure information 
additional information on our pension and postretirement plans is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents investment return assumptions under sfas and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on pension plan assets 
as part of the review and to develop expected rates of return  we considered  with the assistance of our independent consulting actuaries  a stochastic analysis of expected returns based on the domestic plans asset allocation as of both january  and january  this forecast reflects our expected long term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator 
as of january   the expected rates were last year for us large cap stocks  last year for us long term corporate bonds  and last year for inflation 
the range of returns developed relies both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
while the expected investment return assumption is long term in nature  the range of reasonable returns has dropped over the past few years as a consequence of lower inflation and lower bond yields 
in addition  although our asset allocation is predominantly weighted toward equities  a review of our investments indicates a slightly lower expected long term rate of return for our domestic plans than we have had for the past several years 
accordingly  we have reduced the rate by basis points to at december  actuarial losses  where the actual return was less than the expected return  resulted during and the one year investment return was lower than the long term assumption by about million in and million in for all of our domestic pension plans 
by contrast  actual investment return exceeded assumed return in by approximately million 
investment losses enter earnings on an amortized basis so that recent years losses resulted in increased expense of approximately thousand in  as well as an expected thousand increased expense in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential benefits justify the risk premium for equity investments 
pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our domestic pension plans by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
discount rate assumption under sfas and sfas we utilize the citigroup pension discount curve discount curve and liability index in developing the discount rate assumption 
we apply the expected cash flows of the specific defined benefit retirement plan to the interest rates provided in the discount curve 
the rate is developed based on the discount curve on the last day of december 
the discount rate at december  was 
pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our domestic pension plans by approximately thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
rate of projected compensation increase we have reduced our rate of projected compensation increase at december  by basis points to 
the reduction was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate domestic cash contributions  before income taxes  will be approximately million in  while foreign cash contributions will be approximately million 

table of contents other assumptions under sfas during  we reviewed our assumption for the health care cost trend rate under sfas this review was done with reference to cost increases in our own plans  as well as broader market increases in employer provided health care costs and observations of sfas assumptions used by other large employers 
consequently  as of december   we increased our assumption for the health care cost trend rate substantially to a rate of in scaling down to over the next ten years 
previously  the health care cost trend rate was to 
the assumption of declining inflation is consistent with the expectation that medical cost increases will abate after several years of double digit growth 
we have reviewed these assumptions and believe they continue to be appropriate for the expected long term rate of return on our postretirement plans is 
this rate varies from the pension rate of primarily because of the difference in investment of assets 
the assets of the postretirement plan are held in an insurance contract  which results in a lower assumed rate of investment return 
outlook we believe we are in a strong financial position today 
after meeting all of our obligations  we expect to continue to generate free cash of approximately million to million 
our overall strategy has not changed 
it is our intent to leverage our financial strength to grow the business  with acquisitions being our preference 
while we are looking at numerous industries  our primary focus in the acquisition area remains on the petroleum additives industry 
we believe that in the current mergers and acquisition environment this industry will provide the greatest opportunity for a good return on investment while minimizing risk 
as we have stated in the past  we plan to be patient 
we have many internal opportunities for growth in the near term 
we will wait and make the right acquisition for our company when the opportunity arises 
with no bank debt on the balance sheet and with million in senior notes that are not callable until may   we are building excess cash 
we are considering a full range of uses for this cash 
we announced in the fourth quarter that our board had approved a common stock repurchase program of up to million 
in addition  on february   the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend in the amount of per share on the common stock of the corporation 
the dividend is payable april  to shareholders of record on march  we will also be investigating a range of other investments 
we will balance all of these options with the likelihood of merger and acquisition activity and decide on the best course of action to increase shareholder value 
petroleum additives we had success in by growing our business through helping our customers be successful in their marketplace 
our strategy is twofold cost management in those areas that are commodity like in their characteristics through reformulations and new component introduction and growth through product differentiation in the other areas where margins are higher 
looking ahead  we intend to continue with this same strategy 
however  the high cost of raw materials  plus the recent sharp rise on freight and energy costs  continues to be a major concern for us and will be a significant variable in our ultimate profitability in we have instituted multiple price increases in but have yet to restore the margins to the level that existed prior to the cost increases that have occurred since we were expecting that the rate of increase of raw materials might slow in  but early signs are not encouraging 
a major supplier of base oil introduced a record price increase effective february  basic chemicals that we buy such as polyisobutylene  maleic anhydride  ethylene amine  and alpha olefins continue to move up in price 
it is obvious to us that we may not have yet reached the peak of the cost of our purchased raw materials 
we intend to be active in the market to recover these costs 
we expect to continue on the momentum we gained in and expect that petroleum additives will have a higher operating profit in than 
table of contents tel this segment continued to contribute to the overall profitability of newmarket in as we have communicated over the past several years  this product is being phased out around the world and we expect it to show year on year declines in demand for the next few years 
our plans are to continue to manage costs within this business and to raise prices to reflect the economic value of the product 
while tel has been a significant contributor of profits and cash for many years  we expect that it will continue to be a declining contributor to the profit and cash flows of the corporation in the years to come 
we expect to earn less from tel in than critical accounting policies and estimates it is our goal to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows  as well as our financial condition 
we do this by including the information required by the sec  as well as additional information that gives further insight into our financial operations 
our financial report includes a discussion of our accounting principles  as well as methods and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe these discussions and statements fairly represent the financial position and operating results of our company 
the purpose of this portion of our discussion is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in reported financial results 
as discussed in various sections of this annual report on form k  we have made certain payments related to our tel marketing agreements 
we made the final payment of million in the unamortized total is million at december  we are amortizing these costs on an accelerated basis using a declining balance method over the life of the contracts 
we believe this is the appropriate methodology and time period for this amortization based on the facts and circumstances of our tel operations and the estimated product life of tel 
the customer base of tel is significantly concentrated in a few countries and when conditions change that cause a shorter product life or other restrictions outside of our control  the amortization period is adjusted accordingly 
any adjustment to the amortization period would impact earnings  but would have no effect on cash flows 
we continue to keep our accounting for this issue current with the business conditions 
during the second quarter  octel advised us that one of the major tel customers under our marketing agreements had indicated that it was discontinuing the use of tel earlier than we had previously expected 
because of this development  we evaluated the prepayment for marketing agreement services for impairment and concluded the unamortized value at december  is not impaired 
we adjusted the rate of amortization from a declining balance method to a declining balance method 
in addition  based on revised projections of product shipments and product life expectancy  the amortization period is expected to run through the changes increased amortization cost in by thousand 
the total amortization related to the tel marketing agreements is currently projected to be million in  million in  million in  and million in we also have certain identifiable intangibles amounting to million at year end that are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these intangibles relate to our petroleum additives business and are being amortized over periods with up to ten years of remaining life 
we continue to assess the 
table of contents market related to these intangibles  as well as their specific values  and have concluded the amortization periods and values are appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when significant events or circumstances occur that might impair the value of these assets 
these evaluations continue to support the value at which these identifiable intangibles are carried on our financial statements 
however  if conditions were to substantially deteriorate in this market  it could possibly cause a reduction in the periods of this amortization charge or could possibly result in a noncash write off of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in the amortization period would have no cash effect 
while we do not anticipate such a change in the market conditions  this disclosure is provided to enhance the understanding of the factors involved 
we have made disclosure of our environmental issues in item of this annual report on form k  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our environmental accruals are appropriate for the exposures and regulatory guidelines under which we currently operate 
while we currently do not anticipate significant changes to the many factors that could impact our environmental requirements  we continue to keep our accruals consistent with these requirements as they change 
also  as noted in the discussion of legal proceedings in item of this annual report on form k  while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of any legal proceeding  we do not believe that we will experience any material adverse effects on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of any pending or threatened proceeding 
we use assumptions to record the impact of the pension and postretirement plans in the financial statements 
these assumptions include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and health care cost trend rate 
a change in any one of these assumptions could result in different results for the plans 
we develop these assumptions after considering advice from a major global actuarial consulting firm 
information is provided on the pension and postretirement plans in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  further disclosure on the effect of changes in these assumptions is provided in the financial position and liquidity section of item recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

in general  sfas r provides guidance in accounting for transactions in which a company obtains employee services in exchange for share based payments 
sfas r requires that the cost from share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and be determined using a fair value based measurement method 
sfas r was to be effective for interim periods beginning after june  in april  the sec delayed the effective date to the first fiscal year beginning after june  sfas r applies to all share based payment transactions initiated or modified after the effective date 
since all of our exercisable stock options are fully vested  we do not expect sfas r to have a material impact on our financial results unless we grant an additional share based payment

the eitf addressed under which circumstances inventory purchase and sales transactions with the same counterparty should be considered a single exchange transaction  as well as under which circumstances nonmonetary exchanges of inventory within the same line of business should be recognized at fair value 
the eitf is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after march  we do not expect this eitf to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to many market risk factors  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates  as well as changes in the cost of raw materials and marketable security prices 
these risk factors may affect our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing methods  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
when we have derivative instruments  they are with major financial institutions and are not for speculative or trading purposes 
also  as part of our financial risk management  we regularly review significant contracts for embedded derivatives 
as of december   based on our review  we had no contracts with an embedded derivative 
the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows  and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at year end we analyzed only the potential impacts of our hypothetical assumptions 
this analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt of million with none of that amount at variable interest rates 
because all of our debt at year end was at a fixed rate  there was no interest rate risk at the end of the year 
if we were to borrow under our revolving credit facility in the future  we would experience interest rate risk based on the interest rates available to us at that time 
since all of our debt at year end is at a fixed rate  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  holding all other variables constant  would have resulted in a change of million in fair value of our debt 
foreign currency risk we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign subsidiaries  as well as through export sales from our plants in the united states 
these transactions are often denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our primary currency exposures are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
we sometimes enter into forward contracts as hedges to minimize the fluctuation of accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
during  we entered into million of euro denominated forward contracts to minimize currency exposure from expected cash flows from foreign operations 
the contracts all matured in there were no outstanding forward contracts at december  raw material price risk we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  olefin copolymers  maleic anhydride  antioxidants  alcohols  and methacrylates 
our profitability is sensitive to 
table of contents changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
if we experience sudden or sharp increases in the cost of our raw materials  we may not be able to pass on these increases in whole or in part to our customers 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
if we cannot pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products  there will be a negative impact on operating profit 
marketable security price risk at year end  our marketable securities had a fair value of thousand  including net unrealized gains of thousand 
the estimated loss in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the price would have been thousand 
since the securities are classified as available for sale  adjustments to fair value of a temporary nature are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss  and would not impact our results of operations or cash flows until such time that the securities are sold or that the impairment is determined to be other than temporary in nature 
financial policy newmarket corporation s financial standards our goal is to present clearly newmarket s financial information to enhance your understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows and our financial condition 
management s report on the financial statements newmarket prepared the financial statements and related notes in accordance with gaap 
in doing so  management made informed judgments and estimates of the expected effects of certain events and transactions on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements 
the same is true for the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during these reporting periods 
financial data appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k is consistent with these financial statements 
however  actual results could differ from the estimates on which these financial statements are based 
pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc  an independent registered public accounting firm  audited newmarket s consolidated financial statements as of december  and  and for each of the three years in the period ended december   in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
the audit committee of the board of directors  composed only of independent directors  meets with management and pwc to review accounting  auditing  and financial reporting matters 
the independent registered public accounting firm is appointed by the audit committee
