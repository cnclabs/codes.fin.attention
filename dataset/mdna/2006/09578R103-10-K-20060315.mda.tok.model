item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the heading item a risk factors 
overview blue nile is a leading online retailer of high quality diamonds and fine jewelry 
we have built a well respected consumer brand by employing an informative sales process that empowers our customers while offering a broad selection of high quality jewelry at competitive prices 
our websites showcase thousands of independently certified diamonds and styles of fine jewelry  including rings  wedding bands  earrings  necklaces  pendants  bracelets and watches 
our business model enables us to eliminate much of the cost associated with carrying diamond inventory 
we generally do not hold in our inventory the diamonds we offer for sale until we receive a customer order 
upon receipt of a customer order for a specific diamond  we purchase that diamond from one of our suppliers  who generally ships it to us in one business day 
we take title to the diamond at the time of its shipment from our supplier 
unlike diamonds  we typically take rings  wedding bands  earrings  necklaces  pendants  bracelets and watches into inventory before they are ordered by our customers 
as such  we are subject to costs associated with carrying such jewelry products and risks of potential mark downs 
we review our operations based on both our financial results and various non financial measures 
among the key financial factors upon which management focuses in reviewing performance are gross profit margin  operating income  net cash provided by operating activities and growth in net sales 
as an online retailer  we do not incur most of the operating costs associated with physical retail stores  including the costs of maintaining significant inventory and related overhead 
as a result  while our gross profit margins are lower than those typically maintained by traditional diamond and fine jewelry retailers  we are able to realize relatively higher operating income as percentage of net sales 
in  we had a gross profit margin  as compared to gross profit margins of up to or more by some traditional retailers 
we believe our lower gross profit margins result from lower retail prices that we offer to our customers 
we believe 
table of contents these lower prices  in turn  contribute to increased net sales 
our financial results  including our net sales  gross profit and operating income can and do vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the seasonality of our net sales  general economic conditions  the costs to acquire diamonds and precious metals  the costs to acquire customers and our competitors pricing and marketing strategies 
among the key non financial measures of our success are customer feedback and customer satisfaction ratings 
we believe that maintaining high overall customer satisfaction is critical to our ongoing efforts to promote the blue nile brand and to increase our net sales and net income 
we actively solicit customer feedback on our website functionality as well as on the entire purchase experience 
to maintain a high level of performance by our diamond and jewelry consultants  we also undertake an ongoing customer feedback process 
in august  we launched a website in the united kingdom  www 
bluenile 
co 
uk through which we offered a limited number of products 
in september  we began offering customization tools on our uk website to provide customers with the ability to customize their diamond jewelry products and to purchase wedding bands 
in january  we launched a website in canada  www 
bluenile 
ca  through which we offer diamond and jewelry products for sale 
sales through the uk and canada websites totaled million for the fiscal year ended january  critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make certain estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following are the critical accounting policies that we believe require significant estimation and management judgment 
revenue recognition blue nile recognizes revenue and the related gross profit on the date on which we estimate that customers have received their products 
as we require customer payment prior to order shipment  any payments received prior to the customer receipt date are not recorded as revenue 
we utilize our freight vendors tracking information to determine when delivery has occurred  which is typically within one to three days after shipment 
we reduce revenue by a provision for returns  which is based on our historical product return rates 
our contracts with our suppliers generally allow us to return to our suppliers diamonds purchased and returned by our customers at no additional costs other than costs of insurance  shipping and handling  if any 
fraud reserve a majority of our sales is paid by credit card 
although we have measures in place to detect and prevent credit card fraud  we have exposure to losses from fraudulent charges 
we record a reserve for fraud losses based on our historical rate of such losses  which has been minimal 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we believe that all net deferred tax assets shown on our balance sheet are more likely than not to be realized in the future and no valuation allowance is therefore necessary 
in the event that actual results differ from those estimates or we adjust those estimates in future periods  we may need to record a valuation allowance  which will impact deferred tax assets and the results of operations in the period the change is made 

table of contents stock based compensation from inception through the year ended january   we accounted for our employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb and related interpretations 
we amortize stock based compensation using the straight line method over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four years 
we have recorded deferred stock based compensation on certain grants prior to may   representing the difference between the option exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the grant date for financial reporting purposes 
we determined the deemed fair value of our common stock based upon several factors and information available at the time of grant  including the market capitalization of similar retailers and the expected valuation of our initial public offering 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the deemed fair value of our common stock  different amounts of stock based compensation could have been reported 
pro forma information regarding net income attributable to common stockholders and net income per share attributable to common stockholders is required in order to show our net income as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

this information is contained in note to our financial statements 
the fair values of options and shares issued pursuant to our option plan at each grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
as discussed in note to our financial statements  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r in december this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for the company s equity instruments or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity securities or may be settled by the issuance of these securities 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation using apb and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value method 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued in the first annual reporting period commencing after june  therefore  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas r  commencing with the first quarter of using the modified prospective transition method 
we are using the black scholes option pricing model to value options granted 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended year ended year ended january  january  december  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges operating income other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income 
table of contents the following describes certain line items set forth in our consolidated statement of operations net sales 
substantially all of our net sales consist of diamonds and fine jewelry sold via the internet  net of estimated returns 
we also generate net sales from upgrades to our free standard shipping 
historically  net sales have been higher in the fourth quarter as a result of higher consumer spending during the holiday season 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
gross profit 
our gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists of the cost of diamonds and jewelry products sold to customers  inbound and outbound shipping costs  insurance on shipments and the costs incurred to set diamonds into ring  earring and pendant settings  including labor and related facilities costs 
our gross profit has fluctuated historically and we expect it to continue to fluctuate based primarily on our product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefit costs for our employees  marketing costs  credit card fees and costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
these expenses also include certain facilities  fulfillment  customer service  technology and depreciation expenses  as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
as of january   we had an aggregate of  of unamortized deferred stock based compensation relating to certain stock option grants 
these options are considered compensatory because the fair value of our stock on the grant date for financial reporting purposes was greater than the exercise price of the options 
we amortize deferred stock based compensation over the vesting period of the related options  which is generally four years 
substantially all of these expenses are included in selling  general and administrative costs 
upon adoption of sfas r on january   we will reverse the remaining unamortized balance in deferred stock based compensation and begin expensing stock options in accordance with the provisions of this statement 
income taxes 
in and  we recognized an income tax expense of million and million  respectively  related to provision for income taxes at the federal statutory rate 
in  we recognized an income tax benefit of million due to the release of our valuation allowance relating primarily to our net operating loss carryforwards 
prior to  we had recorded no provision for federal and state income taxes since inception 
our aggregate net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were approximately million at january  these net operating loss carryforwards expire periodically between and we expect to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and therefore become a cash taxpayer for federal income tax purposes in 
table of contents the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated  including a comparison of the financial results for the periods indicated dollars in thousands  except per share data comparison of year comparison of year ended january  ended january  to year ended to year ended year ended year ended year ended january  december  january  january  december  change change change change net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative restructuring charges operating income other income expense  net interest income interest expense other income   nm income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income basic net income per share nm diluted net income per share nm comparison of year ended january  to year ended january  net sales the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in the net sales volume of engagement rings and diamond jewelry 
the remaining increase in net sales resulted primarily from growth in demand for loose diamonds  wedding bands and customized non engagement jewelry 
the engagement category represented approximately of our total net sales  as compared to in the prior year 
gross profit the increase in gross profit in resulted primarily from increases in sales volume  as discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in and in  we had a higher proportion of sales in the non engagement jewelry category  which typically carries a higher gross margin than engagement 
this increase in gross margin related to higher jewelry sales was offset by lower gross margins in the engagement category 
we expect that gross profit will fluctuate in the future based primarily on changes in product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was due to several factors 
costs associated with being a public company  including audit and other professional service fees and costs related to the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  increased approximately million 
marketing costs increased million due to the increase in sales volume 
in addition  we 
table of contents experienced increases in online advertising rates during the year 
payroll and related costs increased approximately  due primarily to the addition of new employees 
credit card processing fees increased approximately  due to the increase in sales volume 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in resulted primarily from our ability to leverage our fixed cost base 
in  we recorded approximately  of stock compensation expense as compared to  in we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as a result of expansion of our marketing efforts to drive increases in net sales  growth in our fulfillment and customer service operations to support higher sales volumes  increases in credit card processing fees and other variable expenses and increases in stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income 
the increase in interest income is due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in the average balance of cash and marketable securities during as compared to income taxes in and  we recognized income tax expense related to the provision for income taxes at the federal statutory rate 
we expect that in future periods we will continue to recognize expense related to the provision for income taxes at the federal statutory rate 
we expect to utilize all of our net operating loss carry forwards in and will therefore become a cash tax payer for federal income tax purposes 
comparison of year ended january  to year ended december  net sales the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in the net sales volume of engagement and customized non engagement diamond jewelry 
the remaining increase in net sales resulted from growth in demand for our other jewelry products 
gross profit the increase in gross profit in resulted primarily from increases in sales volume  partially offset by an increase in wholesale prices for gold and platinum in that we did not fully pass on to our customers 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and in and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted primarily from an increase in our average order size caused by a shift in our product mix toward higher priced items  which typically carry a lower gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was due primarily to an increase in marketing costs  the costs associated with being a public company  higher credit card processing fees based on increased volume and higher payroll and payroll related expenses resulting from the addition of new employees 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in resulted primarily from our ability to leverage our fixed cost base and a shift in our product mix toward higher priced items  which typically require less selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of their selling price 
in  we recorded approximately  of stock compensation expense as compared to  in 
table of contents other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income 
the increase in other income expense  net was primarily attributable to increased interest income from cash and marketable securities purchased in following our initial public offering in may  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
interest expense was reduced as a result of the repayment of the outstanding balances on our notes payable and capital lease obligations in early income taxes in  we recognized income tax expense of million related to the provision for income taxes at the federal statutory rate 
this compares to a tax benefit of million recorded in due to the release of our valuation allowance relating primarily to our net operating loss carryforwards 
prior to  our financial statements reflected a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset  and we did not recognize any income tax benefit related to the unutilized net operating loss carryforwards 
in  we concluded that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary based on the determination that it was more likely than not that our net operating loss carryforwards would be utilized in the future 
as a result  the existing valuation allowance of million was reversed in the fourth quarter of liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations through the sale of equity securities  subordinated indebtedness  credit facilities  capital lease obligations and cash generated from operations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash  marketable securities and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our business model provides certain beneficial working capital characteristics 
while we collect cash from sales to customers within several business days of the related sale  we typically have extended payment terms with our suppliers 
as of january   we had working capital of million  which is comprised of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  partially offset by accounts payable of million 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  cash and cash equivalents  inventory and accounts payable are generally higher in the fourth quarter  resulting in fluctuations in our working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in pretax income  the change in the deferred income tax balance  growth in accounts payable related to net sales growth and extended payment terms with our suppliers  partially offset by an increase in inventory balances 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in pretax income  a favorable change in inventory balances compared to the prior year and growth in accounts payable related to net sales growth 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  and was primarily related to the purchase of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and was primarily related to capital expenditures for our technology system infrastructure  including software 
in  we also utilized million to undertake certain leasehold improvements for our new corporate office under a lease that began in august net cash used in financing activities was million in  resulting primarily from the repurchase of our common stock 
in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of common stock with an aggregate total value of million within the months following the date of approval of such repurchase 
during the year ended january  we purchased  shares of our common stock for million 
on february   the board of directors announced the authorization for the company to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock during the next months 
the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the company s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
repurchases may also be made under a rule b plan  which would permit shares to be repurchased when the company might 
table of contents otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  resulting primarily from the net proceeds of our initial public offering 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily related to payments on the remaining balances on our notes payable and capital lease obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on liquidity and cash flows as of january  less than over contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations purchase obligations includes open merchandise purchase orders at january  includes commitments for advertising and marketing services at january  we believe that cash and cash equivalents currently on hand as well as cash flows from operations will be sufficient to continue our operations for the foreseeable future 
while we anticipate that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operational requirements  future capital and operating requirements may change and will depend on many factors  including the level of our net sales  gross margin levels  pricing decisions  the cost to acquire products  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the cost of our fulfillment operations  potential investments in businesses or technologies and continued market acceptance of our products 
we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding through a public or private equity or debt financing in the future  and this financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements at january   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in short term  high quality  interest bearing securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
based on the balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of january   we do not believe a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our net income
