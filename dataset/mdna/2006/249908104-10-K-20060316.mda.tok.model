item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
collaborative relationships esprit pharma  inc in july  we entered into a license agreement with esprit pharma  inc to market and distribute proquin xr in the united states and puerto rico 
under the terms of the license agreement  esprit also has right of first refusal for the sale and marketing of proquin xr for the canadian market 
esprit has agreed to pay us a million license fee  of which million has been paid with an additional million due in july and the remaining million due in july also under the agreement  esprit will pay us percent to percent escalating royalties based on increasing sales of proquin xr 
in connection with the license agreement  we also entered into a related supply agreement with esprit  pursuant to which we will supply commercial quantities of proquin xr to esprit 
in november  esprit launched proquin xr in the united states 
in  we recognized approximately  or of our total revenue for the year  under our agreements with esprit 
to date  all of our revenues from product sales and royalties have come from esprit under our supply agreement with esprit and our exclusive license and marketing agreement with esprit 
if our agreements with esprit related to proquin xr were to be terminated  whether due to a breach of those agreements by us  by esprit  or otherwise  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
madaus srl in november  we entered into a distribution and supply agreement for proquin xr in europe with privately owned specialty pharmaceutical company madaus srl under the terms of the agreement  we granted an exclusive right to madaus for the commercialization of proquin xr in europe and agreed to supply madaus with commercial quantities of proquin xr tablets in bulk form 
madaus will pay us at a pre specified percent of madaus wholesale ex factory price  net of packaging costs 
in january  madaus paid us a  license fee 
an advance payment against future product sales of  will be due within days of the first european regulatory approval 
no revenue was recognized under the agreement in new river pharmaceuticals  inc in june  we entered into a development and license agreement with new river pharmaceuticals inc to develop through the feasibility phase up to three proprietary new river compounds in combination with the acuform technology 
pursuant to the agreement  new river will fund research and development under the agreement  and new river may acquire worldwide rights to use the acuform technology in the product candidates for agreed upon milestone payments and royalties 
new river has proposed an initial product candidate for development  and we are collaborating with new river on the work plan for the feasibility program and expect to begin development work on the product in the second quarter of no revenue was recognized under the agreement in boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals  inc in april  we entered into an agreement with boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals  inc to conduct feasibility studies with an undisclosed pharmaceutical compound and in december  we completed the studies and delivered the agreed feasibility results 
all research and development work with the partner s drug was funded by the partner 
we are not aware of any additional work that we will be requested to perform on this pharmaceutical compound 
for the year ending december   we recognized  or of our total revenue for the year  which approximated the costs under the agreement related to this collaboration 
lg life sciences  ltd 
in august  we entered into a license and distribution agreement granting lg life sciences an exclusive license to the mg glumetza in the republic of korea 
upon signing of the agreement  lg paid us a  upfront license fee 
the agreement also provides for a  milestone fee upon approval in korea and royalties on net sales of the mg glumetza 
the upfront license fee will be amortized over a period of eight years  which represents the estimated length of time that we are obligated to provide assistance in development and manufacturing 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized  and  or and  respectively  of our total revenue for the years related to this collaboration 
biovail laboratories international 
in december  we and biovail entered into an amended and restated license agreement relating to glumetza 
the amended and restated license agreement supersedes our april  amended license and development agreement with biovail 
pursuant to the amended and restated license agreement i we granted biovail an exclusive license in canada to manufacture and market the mg formulation of glumetza  and a non exclusive license to manufacture the mg glumetza in the united states for export to canada  ii biovail will pay us royalties of six percent of net sales of the mg glumetza in canada  and iii biovail will pay us royalties of one percent of net sales of the mg new formulation of glumetza in canada 
the royalty payable by biovail on net sales of the mg glumetza may be increased to ten percent if us regulatory approval of the mg new formulation of glumetza is not obtained by june  provided that we have complied with our obligations related to obtaining such regulatory approval 
in connection with the amended and restated license agreement  we also entered into a manufacturing transfer agreement related to the mg aqueous formulation of glumetza 
pursuant to the manufacturing transfer agreement i biovail granted us a license to manufacture the mg glumetza in the united states from and after the time  if any  that we obtain back up manufacturing rights under the supply agreement with biovail described below  ii biovail granted us an exclusive license to market the mg glumetza in the united states  iii biovail granted us an exclusive license to the glumetza trademark in the united states for the purpose of marketing glumetza  iv biovail has transferred to us the new drug application covering the mg glumetza  v biovail will assist us with manufacturing technology transfer to enable the commercial scale manufacturing of the mg glumetza by or for us  vi we will pay biovail royalties of six percent of net sales of the mg glumetza in the united states from and after any united states regulatory approval of the mg glumetza or  if less  thirty percent of royalties and other similar payments from our licensees with respect to any sales of the mg glumetza not purchased pursuant to the supply agreement described below  and vii we will pay biovail royalties of one percent of net sales of the mg glumetza in the united states or  if less  five percent of royalties and other similar payments from our licensees 
also in connection with the amended and restated license agreement  we entered into a supply agreement with biovail related to the development  manufacturing and supply of the mg new formulation of glumetza 
pursuant to the supply agreement i biovail will perform development and certain other tasks associated with the completion of the development of the mg glumetza  and will assist us with the preparation and submission of a supplement to the nda covering the mg glumetza  ii we and biovail may perform certain additional limited development if the supplement to the glumetza nda is not approved by the fda  iii we will purchase the mg glumetza from biovail for specified supply prices and  subject to our back up manufacturing rights  biovail will be our exclusive supplier of the mg glumetza  iv biovail may supply us with the mg formulation of glumetza through december   and v biovail granted us certain back up manufacturing rights in the event of its inability to supply us with the mg glumetza 
no cash payments were made by either party in connection with their entry into the above described agreements 
in november  biovail pharmaceuticals canada  the sales and marketing division of biovail  launched the mg glumetza in canada 
we are currently developing the us commercial launch strategy for the mg glumetza which we expect to implement in the third quarter of for the year ending december   license revenue recognized under our agreements with biovail was  or of our total revenues 
no revenues were received from biovail in and avi biopharma  inc in june  we entered into a joint collaboration to investigate the feasibility of controlled oral delivery of avi s proprietary neugene antisense agents 
the purpose of the collaboration is to study the feasibility of oral drug formulations based on our gr system 
we have developed candidate dosage forms incorporating one of avi s antisense agents and preclinical testing is underway 
the indication for this product has not been disclosed 
no revenues have been received under this agreement 
other collaborations 
in october  we signed an agreement with activbiotics  inc to conduct feasibility studies on a proprietary activbiotics antibiotic 
we terminated the agreement in june for the years ended december  and  revenues received for work performed for activbiotics were  and  respectively  or and of our total revenues  respectively 
in june  we signed an agreement with an undisclosed collaborative partner to conduct feasibility studies for the partner 
we recognized revenue of approximately  and  or and  of our revenues in and  respectively related to this agreement 
competition other companies that have oral drug delivery technologies competitive with the acuform technology include bristol myers squibb  ivax corporation  alza corporation a subsidiary of johnson johnson  skyepharma plc  biovail corporation  flamel technologies sa  ranbaxy laboratories  ltd  kos pharmaceuticals  inc  intec pharma and alpharma  inc  all of which develop oral tablet products designed to release the incorporated drugs over time 
each of these companies has patented technologies with attributes different from ours  and in some cases with different sites of delivery to the gastrointestinal tract 
bristol myers squibb is currently marketing a sustained release formulation of metformin  glucophage xr  with which glumetza competes 
the limited license that bristol myers squibb obtained from us under our november settlement agreement extends to certain current and internally developed future compounds  which may increase the likelihood that we will face competition from bristol myers squibb in the future on products in addition to glumetza 
several other companies  including ivax corporation  barr pharmaceuticals  inc  mylan laboratories  inc 
and teva pharmaceutical industries  ltd 
have received fda approval for and are selling a controlled release metformin product 
flamel technologies has a controlled release microparticle based formulation of metformin product in phase ii clinical trials 
bayer corporation developed a once daily ciprofloxacin product for the treatment of urinary tract infections  which is currently marketed by schering plough corporation 
there may be other companies developing products competitive with glumetza and proquin xr of which we are unaware 
to our knowledge  we are the only company currently in clinical trials with a sustained release formulation of gabapentin for the u 
s 
market 
gabapentin is currently marketed by pfizer as neurontin for adjunctive therapy for epileptic seizures and for postherpetic pain 
pfizer s basic us patents relating to neurontin have expired  and at least seven companies have received approval to market generic versions of the immediate release product 
in addition  pfizer has developed a new product  lyrica pregabalin  which has been approved for marketing in the us and the european union eu 
competition in pharmaceutical products and drug delivery systems is intense 
we expect competition to increase 
competing technologies or products developed in the future may prove superior to the acuform technology or products using the acuform technology  either generally or in particular market segments 
these developments could make the acuform technology or products using the acuform technology noncompetitive or obsolete 
most of our principal competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and research and development resources than we do 
in addition  many of our potential collaborative partners have devoted  and continue to devote  significant resources to the development of their own drug delivery systems and technologies 
patents and proprietary rights our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technologies and to preserve our trade secrets 
our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights  by among other methods  filing patent applications in the us and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology 
we currently hold nine issued us patents and twelve us patent applications are pending 
in addition  we are preparing patent applications relating to our expanding technology for filing in the us and abroad 
we have also applied for patents in numerous foreign countries 
some of those countries have granted our applications and other applications are still pending 
our pending patent applications may lack priority over others applications or may not result in the issuance of patents 
even if issued  our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  which are difficult to protect 
we seek to protect such information  in part  through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know how 
these confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases  due to  among other things  the lack of an adequate remedy for breach of an agreement or a finding that an agreement is unenforceable 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
our ability to develop our technologies and to make commercial sales of products using our technologies also depends on not infringing others patents or other intellectual property rights 
we are not aware of any intellectual property claims against us 
however  the pharmaceutical industry has experienced extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
for example  pfizer has initiated several suits against companies marketing generic gabapentin products  claiming that these products infringe pfizer s patents 
the results of this litigation could adversely impact the commercialization of any generic gabapentin product 
also  we are aware that patents issued to third parties relating to sustained release drug formulations or particular pharmaceutical compounds could in the future be asserted against us  although we believe that we do not infringe any valid claim of any patents 
if claims concerning any of our products were to arise and it was determined that these products infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be subject to substantial damages for past infringement or be forced to stop or delay our activities with respect to any infringing product  unless we can obtain a license  or we may have to redesign our product so that it does not infringe upon others patent rights  which may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time 
such a license may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we  our collaborators or our licensors were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
in addition  any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us  even if such claims are without merit  could cause our stock price to decline 
from time to time  we may become aware of activities by third parties that may infringe our patents 
infringement by others of our patents may reduce our market shares if a related product is approved and  consequently  our potential future revenues and adversely affect our patent rights if we do not take appropriate enforcement action 
we may need to engage in litigation in the future to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
our issued or licensed patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction 
whether or not the outcome of litigation is favorable to us  defending a lawsuit takes significant time  may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns 
we may also be required to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office for the purpose of determining the priority of inventions in connection with our patent applications or other parties patent applications 
adverse determinations in litigation or interference proceedings could require us to seek licenses which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties 
if we need but cannot obtain a license  we may be prevented from marketing the affected product 
in january  we filed a complaint against ivax corporation in federal court for infringement of two of our us patents related to the acuform delivery technology 
the complaint alleges infringement of our patents by ivax s extended release metformin hydrochloride tablet 
although we intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any litigation against ivax 
manufacturing although we have established internal manufacturing facilities to manufacture supplies for our phase i and phase ii clinical trials  we do not have  and we do not intend to establish in the foreseeable future  internal commercial scale manufacturing capabilities 
rather  we intend to use the facilities of third parties to manufacture products for phase iii clinical trials and commercialization 
our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of products using the acuform technology may adversely affect our ability to deliver such products on a timely or competitive basis 
the manufacturing processes of our third party manufacturers may be found to violate the proprietary rights of others 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays and difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  the market introduction and commercial sales of our products will be delayed  and our future revenue will suffer 
applicable current good manufacturing practices cgmp requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities will apply to the manufacture of products using the acuform technology 
we will depend on the manufacturers of products using the acuform technology to comply with cgmp and applicable foreign standards 
any failure by a manufacturer of products using the acuform technology to maintain cgmp or comply with applicable foreign standards could delay or prevent the initial or continued commercial sale of our products 
we are responsible for supplying commercial quantities of proquin xr to esprit 
for the manufacture of proquin xr tablets  we have entered into an agreement with mova pharmaceuticals  as our sole supplier 
uquifa mexico  sa  our supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to proquin xr  is also a sole supplier to us 
we obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient to proquin xr on a purchase order basis only 
with respect to the mg strength of glumetza  we are currently negotiating a supply arrangement with a tablet manufacturer  and we plan to purchase the active ingredient for mg glumetza on a purchase order basis 
if mg glumetza is approved  we will rely on biovail as our sole supplier 
although we have obtained clinical batches of gabapentin gr from a contract manufacturer  we currently have no long term supply arrangement with respect to gabapentin gr 
if we are unable  for whatever reason  to obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient or proquin xr tablets from our contract manufacturers  we may not be able to manufacture proquin xr in a timely manner  if at all 
likewise  we will be unable to manufacture glumetza in a timely manner  if at all  if we are unable to obtain glumetza mg tablets or active ingredient from contract manufacturers  or glumetza mg tablets from biovail 
marketing and sales in  we announced our determination to evolve from a solely product development focused company to an integrated organization with sales and marketing of our own products 
while preliminary staffing for these activities began in  we anticipate this process will continue over the next several years 
the marketing activities of our licensees of proquin xr and glumetza  and our own marketing activities with respect to glumetza or any other products for which we obtain regulatory approval  will be subject to numerous federal and state laws governing the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the fda regulates post approval promotional labeling and advertising to ensure that they conform with statutory and regulatory requirements 
in addition to fda restrictions  the marketing of prescription drugs is subject to laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse under government healthcare programs 
for example  the federal healthcare program antikickback statute prohibits giving things of value to induce the prescribing or purchase of products that are reimbursed by federal healthcare programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
in addition  federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government 
under this law  the federal government in recent years has brought claims against drug manufacturers alleging that certain marketing activities caused false claims for prescription drugs to be submitted to federal programs 
many states have similar statutes or regulations  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in some states  regardless of the payer 
if we  or our collaborative partners  fail to comply with applicable fda regulations or other laws or regulations relating to the marketing of our products  we could be subject to criminal prosecution  civil penalties  seizure of products  injunction  exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs  as well as other regulatory actions against our product candidates  our collaborative partners or us 
government regulation numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries regulate our research and development activities and those of our collaborative partners 
governmental approval is required of all potential pharmaceutical products using the acuform technology and the manufacture and marketing of products using the acuform technology prior to the commercial use of those products 
the regulatory process takes several years and requires substantial funds 
if new products using the acuform technology do not receive the required regulatory approvals or if such approvals are delayed  our business would be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that the requisite regulatory approvals will be obtained without lengthy delays  if at all 
in the united states  the fda rigorously regulates pharmaceutical products  including any drugs using the acuform technology 
if a company fails to comply with applicable requirements  the fda or the courts may impose sanctions 
these sanctions may include civil penalties  criminal prosecution of the company or its officers and employees  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls and total or partial suspension of production 
the fda may withdraw approved applications or refuse to approve pending new drug applications  premarket approval applications  or supplements to approved applications 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  which must become effective before beginning clinical testing in humans 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase i  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its pharmacokinetic pattern 
in phase ii  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
in phase iii  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda prior to commercialization 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application nda for approval prior to commercialization 
an nda requires that our products are compliant with cgmp 
failure to achieve or maintain cgmp standards for products using the acuform technology would adversely impact their marketability 
in responding to an nda  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application 
failure to receive approval for any products using the acuform technology would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the fda regulates not only prescription and over the counter drugs approved by ndas  but also over the counter products that comply with monographs issued by the fda 
these regulations include cgmp requirements  general and specific over the counter labeling requirements including warning statements  advertising restrictions  and requirements regarding the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients 
in addition  the fda may inspect over the counter products and manufacturing facilities 
a failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may lead to administrative or judicially imposed penalties 
if an over the counter product differs from the terms of a monograph  it will  in most cases  require fda approval of an nda for the product to be marketed 
foreign regulatory approval of a product must also be obtained prior to marketing the product internationally 
foreign approval procedures vary from country to country 
the time required for approval may delay or prevent marketing in certain countries 
in certain instances we or our collaborative partners may seek approval to market and sell certain products outside of the united states before submitting an application for united states approval to the fda 
the clinical testing requirements and the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approvals may differ from that required for fda approval 
although there is now a centralized european union eu approval mechanism in place  each eu country may nonetheless impose its own procedures and requirements 
many of these procedures and requirements are time consuming and expensive 
some eu countries require price approval as part of the regulatory process 
these constraints can cause substantial delays in obtaining required approval from both the fda and foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed  and approval in any single country may not meaningfully indicate that another country will approve the product 
product liability our business involves exposure to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the production and manufacture of pharmaceutical products 
we have obtained product liability insurance for clinical trials currently underway and forecasted sales of our products  but we may not be able to obtain product liability insurance for future trials  we may not be able to obtain product liability insurance for future products  we may not be able to maintain product liability insurance on acceptable terms  we may not be able to secure increased coverage as the commercialization of the acuform technology proceeds  or our insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
our inability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our products 
defending a lawsuit would be costly and significantly divert management s attention from conducting our business 
if third parties were to bring a successful product liability claim or series of claims against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liability limits  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement  nor have we experienced any work stoppage 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
our success is dependent in large part upon the continued services of john w 
fara  phd  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  carl pelzel  our executive vice president and chief operating officer  and other members of our executive management team  and on our ability to attract and retain key management and operating personnel 
we do not have agreements with dr 
fara  mr 
pelzel or any of our other executive officers that provide for their continued employment with us 
management  scientific and operating personnel are in high demand in our industry and are often subject to competing offers 
the loss of the services of one or more members of management or key employees or the inability to hire additional personnel as needed could result in delays in the research  development and commercialization of our products and potential product candidates 
additional information the address of our internet website is http www

item a 
risk factors in addition to other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company 
we believe the following risks  along with the risks described elsewhere in this form k  including the risks described above under business competition  patents and proprietary rights  manufacturing  marketing and sales  government regulation  product liability  and employees  are the material risks we face at the present time 
if any of the risks or uncertainties described in this form k actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the risks and uncertainties described in this form k are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
we depend heavily on our marketing partners for the successful commercialization of our lead products  proquin xr and glumetza 
our two lead products  proquin xr and the mg strength glumetza  have been approved by the fda 
our other product candidates are in earlier stages of clinical or preclinical development 
we anticipate that in the near term our success will depend on royalties generated from sales of proquin xr and sales of glumetza 
we have licensed exclusive marketing rights to proquin xr in the united states to esprit pharma  inc esprit launched proquin xr in november if esprit fails to successfully commercialize proquin xr  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
we have licensed exclusive marketing rights to the mg glumetza in canada to biovail 
biovail launched the mg glumetza in canada in november if biovail fails to successfully commercialize glumetza  our business and future revenues will be materially and adversely affected 
if we fail to enhance our marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  or fail to enter into arrangements with third parties  we will not be able to create a market for glumetza in the united states 
currently  we have limited sales and marketing staff  and no distribution capabilities 
in order to generate sales of glumetza or any other product candidates that receive regulatory approval that we choose to market or co market  we must substantially enhance our internal marketing and sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities  or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for us 
the development of a sales and distribution infrastructure requires substantial resources  which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel 
to the extent that we enter into marketing and sales arrangements with other companies  our revenues will depend on the efforts of others 
these efforts may not be successful 
if we fail to fully develop sales  marketing and distribution channels  or enter into arrangements with third parties  we will experience delays in product sales and incur increased costs 
we are expecting operating losses in the future 
to date  we have had limited revenues from license fees  product sales  collaborative research and development arrangements and feasibility studies  although we have received million in license fees from biovail and esprit in for the year ended december   we had total revenues of million and for the years ended december  and  we had total revenues of  and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we incurred net losses of million and for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as we continue our research and development efforts  preclinical testing and clinical trial activities  and expand our sales and marketing organization  we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next year 
therefore  we expect our cumulative losses to increase 
these losses  among other things  have had  and we expect that they will continue to have  an adverse impact on our total assets  shareholders equity and working capital 
our product candidates are at early stages of development and may not be successful or achieve market acceptance 
we are preparing for a phase iii clinical trial of gabapentin gr  and we have another product candidate in earlier stages of development 
in addition  biovail is assisting us with the preparation of a supplemental nda filing for the new mg formulation of glumetza  and we expect to begin performing feasibility studies by the second quarter of with another compound in combination with the acuform technology for a collaborative partner 
our own product candidates and those of our collaborative partners are subject to the risk that any or all of them are found to be ineffective or unsafe  or otherwise may fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances 
we are unable to predict whether any of these other product candidates will receive regulatory clearances or be successfully manufactured or marketed 
further  due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained  the time frames for commercialization of any products are long and uncertain 
even if these other product candidates receive regulatory clearance  our products may not achieve or maintain market acceptance 
also  all of our product candidates  other than the mg formulation of glumetza  use the acuform technology 
if it is discovered that the acuform technology could have adverse effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective as a delivery system for drugs or therapeutics  our product development efforts and our business would be significantly harmed 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and affect our stock price 
the following factors will affect our quarterly operating results and may result in a material adverse effect on our stock price the timing of the commercial launch of glumetza in the united states  the degree of commercial success of proquin xr and glumetza  variations in revenues obtained from collaborative agreements  including milestone payments  royalties  license fees and other contract revenues  decisions by collaborative partners to proceed or not to proceed with subsequent phases of a collaboration or program  market acceptance of the acuform technology  regulatory actions  adoption of new technologies  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents  infringement allegations and litigation matters  the introduction of new products by our competitors  manufacturing costs and difficulties  results of clinical trials for our products  changes in government funding  third party reimbursement policies  and the status of our compliance with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of our collaborative arrangements may give rise to disputes over commercial terms  contract interpretation and ownership of our intellectual property and may adversely affect the commercial success of our products 
we currently have a collaboration agreement for development of product candidates through the feasibility phase with new river pharmaceuticals 
in addition  we have in the past and may in the future enter into other collaborative arrangements  some of which have been based on less definitive agreements  such as memoranda of understanding  material transfer agreements  options or feasibility agreements 
we may not execute definitive agreements formalizing these arrangements 
collaborative relationships are generally complex and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights  obligations and revenues of the parties  including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations  especially when the applicable collaborative provisions have not been fully negotiated and documented 
such disputes can delay collaborative research  development or commercialization of potential products  and can lead to lengthy  expensive litigation or arbitration 
the terms of collaborative arrangements may also limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies developed pursuant to such collaborations 
additionally  the collaborators under these arrangements might breach the terms of their respective agreements or fail to prevent infringement of the licensed patents by third parties 
moreover  negotiating collaborative arrangements often takes considerably longer to conclude than the parties initially anticipate  which could cause us to agree to less favorable agreement terms that delay or defer recovery of our development costs and reduce the funding available to support key programs 
we may not be able to enter into future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms  which would harm our ability to develop and commercialize our current and potential future products 
further  even if we do enter into collaboration arrangements  it is possible that our collaborative partners may not choose to develop and commercialize products using the acuform technology 
other factors relating to collaborations that may adversely affect the commercial success of our products include any parallel development by a collaborative partner of competitive technologies or products  arrangements with collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies  premature termination of a collaboration agreement  or failure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercial sales of products using the acuform technology 
generally  our collaborative arrangements do not restrict our collaborative partners from competing with us or restrict their ability to market or sell competitive products 
our current and any future collaborative partners may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
our collaborative partners may also terminate their collaborative relationships with us or otherwise decide not to proceed with development and commercialization of our products 
it is difficult to develop a successful product 
if we do not develop a successful product we may not be able to raise additional funds 
the drug development process is costly  time consuming and subject to unpredictable delays and failures 
before we or others make commercial sales of products using the acuform technology  other than glumetza and proquin xr  we  our current and any future collaborative partners will need to conduct preclinical and clinical tests showing that these products are safe and effective  and obtain regulatory approval from the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
we will have to curtail  redirect or eliminate our product development programs if we or our collaborative partners find that the acuform technology has unintended or undesirable side effects  or products that appear promising in preclinical or early stage clinical studies do not demonstrate efficacy in later stage  larger scale clinical trials 
even when or if our products obtain regulatory approval  successful commercialization requires market acceptance  cost effective commercial scale production  and reimbursement under private or governmental health plans 
any material delay or failure in the governmental approval process and or the commercialization of our potential products  particularly glumetza or proquin xr  would adversely impact our financial position and liquidity and would make it difficult for us to raise financing on favorable terms  if at all 
if we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals in the timeframes we announce and expect  the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and our business will be harmed 
for planning purposes  we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific  clinical  regulatory and other product development and commercialization goals 
these milestones may include our expectations regarding the commercial launch of our products by us or our licensees  and the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings 
from time to time  we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones  such as the commercial launch of the mg strength of glumetza in the united states or the commencement of the phase iii clinical trial of gabapentin gr 
all of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions 
the actual timing of these milestones can vary considerably from our estimates depending on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control  including our available capital resources  the efforts of our licensees with respect to the commercialization of our products  the rate of progress  costs and results of our clinical trial and research and development activities  including the extent of scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions and our ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria  our receipt of approvals by the fda and other regulatory agencies and the timing thereof  other actions by regulators  our ability to access sufficient  reliable and affordable supplies of components used in the manufacture of our product candidates  including insulin and materials for our gr system  and the costs of ramping up and maintaining manufacturing operations  as necessary 
if we fail to achieve our announced milestones in the timeframes we announce and expect  our business and results of operations may be harmed and the price of our stock may decline 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval  we will be limited in our ability to commercialize our products  and our business will be harmed 
the regulatory process is expensive and time consuming 
even after investing significant time and expenditures on clinical trials  we may not obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates 
data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
significant clinical trial delays would impair our ability to commercialize our products and could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do 
in addition  changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections 
even if we receive regulatory approval  this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market a product 
further  with respect to our approved products  once regulatory approval is obtained  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review 
the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or manufacturing facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
manufacturers of approved products are also subject to ongoing regulation  including compliance with fda regulations governing current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
the approval process outside the united states is uncertain and may limit our ability to develop  manufacture and sell our products internationally 
to market any of our products outside of the united states  we and our collaborative partners  including madaus and lg life sciences  are subject to numerous and varying foreign regulatory requirements  implemented by foreign health authorities  governing the design and conduct of human clinical trials and marketing approval for drug products 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval set forth above  and approval by the fda does not ensure approval by the health authorities of any other country  nor does the approval by foreign health authorities ensure approval by the fda 
if we or our licensees are unable to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third party payers  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our product candidates will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payers such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies  and other healthcare related organizations 
if reimbursement is not available for our products or product candidates  demand for these products may be limited 
further  any delay in receiving approval for reimbursement from third party payers would have an adverse effect on our future revenues 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  including pharmaceuticals 
our products may not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may be unavailable to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an acceptable return on our investment 
federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare 
existing regulations affecting pricing may also change before many of our product candidates are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we may develop 
we depend on third parties who are single source suppliers to manufacture proquin xr  glumetza and our later stage product candidates 
if these suppliers are unable to manufacture proquin xr  glumetza or our product candidates  our business will be harmed 
we are responsible for supplying commercial quantities of proquin xr to esprit 
for the manufacturer of proquin xr tablets  we have entered into an agreement with mova pharmaceuticals  as our sole supplier 
uquifa mexico  sa  our supplier of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to proquin xr  is also a sole supplier to us 
we obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient to proquin xr on a purchase order basis only 
if we are unable  for whatever reason  to obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredient or proquin xr tablets from our contract manufacturers  we may not be able to manufacture proquin xr in a timely manner  if at all 
we are currently negotiating a supply arrangement with a tablet manufacturer for the mg strength of glumetza  and we plan to purchase the active ingredient for the mg glumetza on a purchase order basis 
if the new formulation of mg glumetza is approved  we will rely on biovail as our sole supplier 
we will be unable to manufacture glumetza in a timely manner if we are unable to obtain glumetza mg tablets from contract manufacturers or active pharmaceutical ingredient from suppliers  or glumetza mg tablets from biovail 
although we have obtained clinical batches of gabapentin gr from a contract manufacturer  we currently have no long term supply arrangement with respect to gabapentin gr 
if we choose to acquire new and complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves  we may be unable to complete these acquisitions or to successfully integrate them in a cost effective and non disruptive manner 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands  competitive pressures and technologies 
accordingly  we may in the future pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies instead of developing them ourselves 
we have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or such investment 
we do not know if we would be able to successfully complete any acquisitions  or whether we would be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  product or technology or retain any key employees 
integrating any business  product or technology we acquire could be expensive and time consuming  disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management 
if we were to be unable to integrate any acquired businesses  products or technologies effectively  our business would suffer 
in addition  any amortization or charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our operating results 
we have implemented certain anti takeover provisions 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and the california general corporation law could discourage a third party from acquiring  or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control of our company without approval of our board of directors 
these provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
certain provisions allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
we are also subject to the provisions of section of the california general corporation law which requires a fairness opinion to be provided to our shareholders in connection with their consideration of any proposed interested party reorganization transaction 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill 
the provisions described above  our poison pill and provisions of the california general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly impact our results of operations 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours in understanding and complying with these laws  regulations and standards 
as a result of this uncertainty and other factors  devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards has resulted in and may in the future result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities 
we also expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and financial reporting costs 
in addition  these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
moreover  we may not be able to comply with these new rules and regulations on a timely basis 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
to the extent these costs are significant  our general and administrative expenses are likely to increase 
if we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls  our stock price could suffer 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires companies to do a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting 
at the end of each fiscal year  we must perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting  include in our annual report the results of the evaluation  and have our external auditors publicly attest to such evaluation 
if we fail to complete future evaluations on time  or if our external auditors cannot attest to our future evaluations  we could fail to meet our regulatory reporting requirements and be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area  which has a history of seismic activity 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan  and our back up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur 
a significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  we received fda and canadian regulatory approval of glumetza  our extended release metformin formulation for treatment of type ii diabetes and fda approval of proquin xr  our extended release formulation of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin 
in july  we entered into a license agreement with esprit pharma  inc to market and distribute proquin xr in the us and puerto rico with a right of first refusal to rights in canada 
esprit agreed to pay us a million license fee and percent to percent escalating royalties based on increasing product sales 
esprit launched proquin xr in the us in november in december  we settled a dispute with biovail related to the commercialization of glumetza which resulted in the establishment of our right to manufacture and market the mg formulation of glumetza in the us and all international markets with the exception of canada and our gaining an exclusive right to market the mg glumetza in the us in november  biovail launched the mg glumetza in canada 
in  we entered into agreements with new river pharmaceuticals inc and boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals  inc to conduct feasibility studies on their compounds using our acuform technology 
in  we reported a net loss of million or per share  compared to a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  cash and investment balances at december  were million 
revenues for the year ended december  totaled approximately million compared with  for the year ended december  collaborative revenue increased to million in from  in as a result of increased development services provided for boehringer ingelheim 
license revenue increased to  from  due to revenue recognized under license agreements with esprit and biovail 
royalty revenue was  in as a result of our royalty on net sales of proquin xr by esprit 
product sales revenue was  in as a result of sales of proquin xr under our supply agreement with esprit 
in  there were no revenues recognized related to royalties or product sales 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreased external expenses such as clinical and manufacturing expenses for our mg glumetza and proquin xr as the products proceeded from development to commercialization 
critical accounting policies and estimates a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and use of estimates to be critical policies 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
revenue related to collaborative research agreements with corporate partners is recognized as the expenses are incurred for each contract 
we are required to perform research activities as specified in each respective agreement on a best efforts basis  and we are reimbursed based on the costs associated with supplies  other outsourced activities and the hours worked by employees on each specific contract 
our business strategy includes performing additional development work for our partners  which we expect will generate milestone payments and license fees 
we will recognize nonrefundable substantive milestone payments pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of specified milestones where no further obligation to perform exists under that provision of the arrangement and when collectibility is reasonable assured 
non refundable license fees are recognized over the period of continuing involvement of a specific contract or  if no continuing involvement exists  such license fees are recognized upon receipt 
management has made assumptions relating to the period of continuing involvement  which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses recorded in any given period 
royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalties received under our agreement with esprit will initially be recognized based on esprit s cash receipts due to our inability to estimate returns and potential bad debt related to underlying sales following the initial commercialization of proquin xr 
esprit royalty revenue  therefore  is not reflective of esprit s actual product sales in the respective period 
product sales revenue related to our supply agreement with esprit is recognized after a day right of return has expired 
accrued liabilities we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  preclinical studies and other corporate activities 
some of the accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
if possible  we obtain information regarding the unbilled services directly from the service provider 
however  we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development or administrative staff 
if we underestimate the activity associated with a study or service at a given point in time  it would result in understated expense in the period presented and overstated expense in subsequent periods 
historically  our estimated accrued liabilities have approximated actual expense incurred 
stock based compensation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of stock  market quotes are not available for long term  nontransferable stock options because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
however  the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes to the subjective imputed assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models to not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee and director stock options 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
there is limited historical information available to support our estimate of certain assumptions required to value stock options 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to take advantage of market highs 
however  empirical data shows that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term  we consider the vesting period for the award  our historical experience of employee and director stock option exercises  the expected volatility  and a comparison to relevant peer group data 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
change in accounting principle in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  which requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by a company if that company absorbs a majority of the vie s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the vie 
prior to the adoption of fin  vies were generally consolidated only by companies owning a majority voting interest in the vie 
we adopted fin on july   and consolidated ddl  as of that date  as we determined that ddl was a vie  as defined by fin  and that we absorbed a majority of its expected losses 
accordingly  we were required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of ddl on july  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
also  as we had been responsible for of ddl s losses under the terms of our agreements with elan  we had been recognizing of ddl s losses under the equity method of accounting prior to july  since the inception of ddl through june   we had recognized approximately million  or of ddl s expenses 
upon the adoption of fin  we calculated what the impact would have been on our operations had we consolidated of ddl s expenses and recorded an offsetting noncontrolling interest equal to of ddl s expenses the amounts funded by elan under the arrangement for the period from ddl s inception through june   or million  and determined that there was no cumulative catch up charge to record upon the adoption of fin our results of operations include of the operating results of ddl for the six months ended december  the noncontrolling interest for the period was not material  and it has been included as an offset to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
as ddl does not have any revenue  its accounts are reflected entirely in our consolidated operating expenses 
in september  we modified our agreements with elan that govern the terms of the joint venture and as a result of such modifications  we became responsible for of the funding requirements of ddl 
accordingly  subsequent to september  we did not allocate any portion of ddl s results of operations to the noncontrolling interest 
in june  ddl became our wholly owned subsidiary when we acquired elan s interest in ddl 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues revenues for the years ended december   and were approximately   and  respectively 
in  collaborative revenue consisted of  recognized under a collaboration with boehringer ingelheim 
we do not expect to perform additional product development services for boehringer ingelheim under this collaboration agreement in license revenue was  and resulted from revenue recognized under license agreements with esprit  biovail and lg life sciences 
we expect we will recognize license revenue of approximately million in related to license fee payments received in  or prior to  in  royalty revenue related to esprit s sales of proquin xr was  and product sales revenue was  and related to sales under our supply agreement with esprit 
in  revenues consisted of  recognized under a collaboration with activbiotics and another collaborative partner 
we completed product development services for both partners and we do not expect to perform additional product development services for these partners under the respective agreements 
other revenues in included  recorded under the license agreement with lg life sciences 
in  revenues consisted of  recognized under our collaboration with activbiotics and  from small collaborations with undisclosed partners 
cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended december  was approximately  or approximately of product sales 
however  cost of sales did not include the costs of certain material previously expensed 
prior to commercialization  materials that we purchased were expensed to research and development 
we were able to use some of this material in our products sold 
if we were to include the costs that were previously expensed to research and development but then used in our products sold  our cost of sales would have been approximately  greater than the reported amounts or of product sales for the year ended december  cost of sales consists of costs of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  contract manufacturing and packaging costs  product quality testing  internal labor related to the manufacturing process and shipping costs 
research and development expense research and development expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of  was due primarily to reductions of million in expense related to proquin xr and glumetza which were partially offset by increased depreciation of  related primarily to leasehold improvements completed in the fourth quarter of since our two lead products were approved by the fda in the second quarter of and our other product candidates are still in earlier stages of development  we believe that our research and development expenses will remain relatively flat during as we advance our other product candidates into later stage clinical development 
the decrease of  in research and development expense in was primarily due to a decrease of  in external research and development expenses  including activities to complete clinical trials and reports for glumetza and proquin in the fourth quarter of  which were partially offset by  in expense related to the hiring of additional personnel to support the fda filings and analytical testing of our product candidates 
our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  outsourced clinical and other research activities  consultants  depreciation  facilities and utilities 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in research and in development as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore results  generally  in increasing expenditures 
furthermore  our business strategy involves licensing certain of our drug candidates to collaborative partners 
depending upon when such collaborative arrangements are executed  the amount of costs incurred solely by us will be impacted 
our largest cumulative research and development expense over the last three years has been related to the development of gabapentin gr  proquin xr and glumetza 
in and  gabapentin gr accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our research and development expenses for that year and none in in  and  proquin xr accounted for  and  respectively  of our research and development expenses for that year 
in  and  glumetza  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total research and development expenses for that year 
our research and development activities can be divided into preclinical stage programs  which include analytical testing  process development  pilot scale production and preclinical testing  and later stage programs  which include clinical testing  regulatory affairs and manufacturing clinical supplies 
the costs associated with these programs approximate the following preclinical programs later stage programs our research and development activities can be divided into those related to our internal projects and those related to collaboration arrangements 
the costs related to internal projects versus collaboration arrangements approximate the following internal projects collaborative arrangements funded by partners collaborative arrangements not funded by partners the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives and the related stages of development for each product in development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion date of current phase contains forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see item a

we expect that the pharmaceutical products that we develop internally will take  on average  from four to eight years to research  develop and obtain fda approval in the united states 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application or ind which  if successful  allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase i  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
a phase i trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase ii  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
a phase ii trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase iii  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda prior to commercialization of the product 
a phase iii trial for our average potential product may take to years to plan and complete 
the most significant expenses associated with clinical development derive from the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have two products that have completed phase iii 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping for each product 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase of million in was due to approximately  in expense related to the planning and organization of commercial manufacturing activities at our contract manufacturer for proquin xr  increased salary expense of  related to salary bonuses accrued under the bonus plan approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors in july and marketing expense of  primarily related to proquin xr marketing incurred prior to the licensing of proquin xr and during the transition of marketing activities to esprit

we have not generated any federal or state taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately million

series a preferred stock and dividends in january  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock at a price of  per share to fund our share of the initial capitalization of ddl 
the series a preferred stock accrues a dividend of per annum  compounded semi annually and payable in shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock and dividends are convertible at anytime into our common stock 
the original conversion price of the series a preferred stock was 
however  as a result of our march and october financing  the conversion price has been adjusted to per share 
in december  we entered into an agreement with the series a preferred stockholder to resolve a misunderstanding between us and the stockholder relating primarily to prior adjustments to the conversion price of the series a preferred stock the december agreement 
pursuant to the december agreement  among other matters  we agreed to adjust the conversion price to per share 
we and the stockholder also agreed to binding interpretations of certain other terms related to the series a conversion price 
prior to december  the amounts calculated as series a preferred stock dividends were accounted for as an adjustment to the conversion price following eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios issue no 

as a result of the december agreement  we determined that a significant modification of the preferred stock agreement had occurred  and  therefore  a new commitment date was established for the series a preferred stock 
further  we determined that the fair value of the modified preferred stock was below the carrying value of such securities as of the date of the modification  therefore  no deemed dividend resulted from this modification 
also  we determined that although a new commitment date had been established  this change did not result in a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to emerging issues task force issue no 
 application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
however  an anti dilution provision of the series a preferred stock was triggered by the company s january financing  which adjusted the conversion price of the series a preferred stock to 
as a result of the adjusted conversion price and an increase in the amount of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a preferred stock due to additional accumulated dividends  the series a preferred stock now contains a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to issue no 
for the year ended december   we recognized series a preferred stock deemed dividends of approximately  attributable to the beneficial conversion feature 
we will continue to recognize series a preferred stock deemed dividends until the earlier of  the time the series a preferred stock is converted to common stock or january in conjunction with the series a preferred stockholder agreement  we issued a warrant to the series a preferred stockholder 
the warrant is exercisable for shares of our common stock during the period between january and january the exercise price of the warrant initially will be equal to the series a preferred stock conversion in effect as of january  the exercise price of the warrant will decrease by approximately per year during the exercise period  such that the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant will increase by approximately per year 
the exercise of the warrant will be satisfied only by surrender of outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
stock based compensation expense in december  our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our stock option plan the plan by  shares 
on may   at the annual meeting of shareholders  our shareholders approved the increase to the plan 
in december and march  we granted options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock out of the  share increase of common stock at exercise prices of and  respectively  which represented the fair market values of our common stock on the respective dates of grant 
however  as the options were not deemed authorized for grant until the shareholders approved the increase in the number of shares authorized under the plan  the applicable measurement date for accounting purposes was on the date such approval was obtained 
since the fair market value of the underlying common stock on may  was  which was greater than the exercise prices of the stock options granted  we were required to record the difference of approximately  as deferred stock based compensation expense to be recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock options 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately  in stock based compensation expense related to the stock options

liquidity and capital resources operating activities cash provided by operations in the year ended december  was approximately  compared to cash used in operations of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to increases in deferred revenue related to license payments received under our agreements with esprit and biovail  partially offset by the net loss 
in  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to the net loss and movements in working capital 
investing activities cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  totaled approximately  and consisted of a net increase in marketable securities of  resulting from investment of license fees received under our agreements with esprit and biovail in the third quarter of and  in purchases of lab and office equipment 
cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  totaled approximately  and consisted primarily of a net decrease in marketable securities of  that was partially offset by  in purchases of capital equipment and leasehold improvements  including approximately  to build out the additional space we leased in may cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  totaled approximately  and consisted primarily of a net increase in marketable securities of  and  of purchases of lab equipment  furniture  computers and leasehold improvements 
marketable securities were increased in after the completion of our public offering in the fourth quarter 
we expect future capital expenditures will include additional product development and quality control laboratory equipment to maintain current good manufacturing practices cgmp in our laboratories 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and consisted primarily of  of net proceeds from our registered direct public offering of  shares of common stock for per share in january and  in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  warrants and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan  which were partially offset by the repayment of the elan promissory note of  and  in payments on equipment loans and capital lease obligations 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and consisted primarily of  of proceeds from exercises of stock options and warrants partially offset by  in payments on equipment loans and capital leases 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and consisted primarily of net proceeds of  received in april from a private placement of common stock and net proceeds of  received from our public offering of common stock in the fourth quarter 
proceeds received in were partially offset by  in payments on equipment loans and capital leases 
contractual obligations and capital resources through december   we have invested approximately  in equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements  of which approximately  was financed through long term debt equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   there were no further borrowings available under the financing arrangements 
if we do not obtain additional credit arrangements  we will need to spend our own resources for future equipment purchases 
as of december   our aggregate contractual obligations for the next three years are as shown in the following table 
we have no contractual obligations with maturities greater than three years 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years operating leases purchase orders as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  working capital of  and accumulated net losses of  in july  we received a million payment from biovail for the fda approval of glumetza and million from esprit as upfront license fees for proquin xr 
esprit is required to pay us additional license fees totaling million  in equal installments  on july  and july  we expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next year 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least december however  we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
our cash needs may vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including results of research and development efforts  financial terms of definitive license agreements or other commercial agreements we enter into  if any  relationships with collaborative partners  resolution of any disputes with collaborative partners  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  technological advances  results of clinical testing  requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies  and acquisitions or investment in complimentary businesses  products or technologies 
we will need substantial funds of our own or from third parties to conduct research and development programs  conduct preclinical and clinical testing  and manufacture or have manufactured and market or have marketed potential products using the gr system 
our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
we have limited credit facilities and no other committed sources of capital 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing arrangements to continue our development programs 
we may not be able to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available we may have to delay  postpone or terminate clinical trials  curtail other operations significantly  and or obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
the inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on our company 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment fas r  which is a revision of fas fas r supersedes apb no 
and amends fas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas fas r requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee and director stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule amending the compliance dates for fas r 
in accordance with the new rule  we will adopt fas r on january  fas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of fas for all awards granted to employees and directors prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to adopt fas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by fas  we currently account for share based payments to employees and directors using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee and director stock options where the exercise price equals the fair market value of the underlying common shares on the measurement date 
accordingly  the adoption of fas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of fas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and loss per share in note  summary of significant accounting policies  stock based compensation to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we estimate that stock options granted prior to december  are expected to result in expense of approximately million in in june  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections fas 
fas replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
fas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle unless it is impractical to do so 
fas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of fas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter 
sfas no 
amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin  or arb  no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage are to be recognized as current period charges 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our operating results have not been sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities would not change by a significant amount 
foreign currency fluctuations we have not had any significant transactions in foreign currencies  nor did we have any balances that were due or payable in foreign currencies at december  therefore  a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we do not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure
