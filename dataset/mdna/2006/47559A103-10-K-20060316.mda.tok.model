general the parent company is a bank holding company founded in and headquartered in jeffersonville  new york 
the parent company owns of the outstanding shares of the bank s common stock and derives substantially all of its income from the bank s operations in the form of dividends paid to the parent company 
the bank is a new york commercial bank chartered in serving sullivan county  new york with branch offices in jeffersonville  eldred  liberty  loch sheldrake  monticello  livingston manor  narrowsburg  callicoon and wurtsboro 
the bank s administrative offices are located in jeffersonville  new york 
the company s mission is to serve the community banking needs of its borrowers and depositors  who predominantly are individuals  small businesses and local municipal governments 
the company believes it understands its local customer needs and provides quality service with a personal touch 
the financial results of the company are influenced by economic events that affect the communities we serve as well as national economic trends  primarily interest rates  affecting the entire banking industry 
changes in net interest income have the greatest impact on the company s net income 
national economic policies have caused interest rates to rise times since june the company s yields on interest earning assets have fallen and the costs of interest bearing liabilities have risen  creating net interest margin compression 
locally  the economy continued to exhibit strength in while the local economic forecast has been bright  it should be acknowledged that the economy in most other areas of new york state continues to be less robust 
significant improvement in the local economy continues to be demonstrated in the sullivan county real estate market 
several new housing projects continued to progress along with a vibrant real estate market  which increase optimism in the county s future 
a permanent concert facility will open on the original site of the woodstock festival in bethel this year 
several native american run casinos are still on the horizon 
the success of these projects  tourism  real estate values and the availability of qualified labor is critical to the local economy and the company 
critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and values of real estate particularly in sullivan county 
collateral underlying certain real estate loans could lose value which could lead to future additions to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp provides additional guidance on when an investment in a debt or equity security should be considered impaired and when that impairment should be considered other than temporary and recognized as a loss in earnings 
specifically  the guidance clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell has not been made 
the fsp also requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
it is not expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition total assets increased by million or to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to a million or increase in net loans from million at december  to million at december  a net decrease of million in the portfolio of securities available for sale for  primarily due to maturities and calls  was a funding source for new loan growth 
the overall assets increase was funded by a million increase in total deposits from million at december  to million at december  the deposit increase included million of brokered deposits 
two new borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb totaling million were added to help fund the loan growth and repay one fhlb borrowing which matured for million 
in  total gross loans increased million or from million to million 
within the loan portfolio  commercial loans increased by million to million at december   residential real estate increased by million to million  commercial real estate loans increased million to million  home equity loans increased million to million  while consumer installment loans decreased million to million 
the growth in commercial real estate loans reflects the company s strategy to provide loans for local real estate projects where there is strong loan to value ratio taking into consideration possible speculation regarding casino gambling proposals 
the growth in residential mortgages reflects new products to meet the highly competitive nature of this market 
as a result of casino gambling proposals and related local economic improvement  the company anticipates continued residential and commercial real estate loan opportunities 
accordingly  additional growth is anticipated in real estate loans during the growth in the non real estate commercial loan portfolio reflects continued business growth in the county 
the overall loan portfolio is structured in accordance with management s belief that loans secured by residential and commercial real estate generally result in lower loan loss levels compared to other types of loans  because of the value of the underlying collateral 
in the event that the casino gambling proposals do not progress  collateral underlying certain real estate projects could lose value 
there was no other real estate owned at december  or at december  total non performing loans increased from million at december  to million at december  net loan charge offs decreased from  in to  in at december   the allowance for loan losses equaled million representing of total gross loans outstanding and of total non performing loans 
total deposits increased million to million at december  from million at december  time deposits increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million or 
the majority of this increase was due to brokered time deposits in the amount of million or of total deposits 
these deposits were obtained to fund future anticipated growth of the loan portfolio 
increases in demand and now and super now accounts totaling million were offset by reductions in saving and insured money market deposits of million 
total stockholders equity was million at december   an increase of million from december  the increase was due primarily to net income of million partially offset by cash dividends of million and a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive income of results of operations versus net income net income for of million decreased or  from the net income of million 
the lower earnings level in reflects the interaction of a number of factors 
the most significant factor which reduced net income was an increase in deposit interest expense which outpaced loan and security rate increases  squeezing the net interest spread 
net interest income remained flat from to at million 
an increase in loan interest and fees of million to million from million or were partially offset by a decrease in income on securities of  or to million 
interest expense on deposits increased million or to million primarily due to continued rate increases by the federal reserve bank 
the provision for loan losses decreased or  from  in to  in salary and employee benefit expense increased  or primarily due to the addition of new employees  normal salary increases and the increased costs of providing pension and health care benefits 
occupancy and equipment expense increased  or  primarily due to an increase in software and equipment maintenance agreements and the on line banking program 
interest income and interest expense throughout the following discussion  net interest income and its components are expressed on a tax equivalent basis which means that  where appropriate  tax exempt income is shown as if it were earned on a fully taxable basis 
the largest source of income for the company is net interest income  which represents interest earned on loans  securities and short term investments  less interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
tax equivalent net interest income of million for represented an increase of over net interest margin decreased basis points to in compared to in  due to overall increases in interest bearing liability yields

total interest expense in increased million to million from in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased from million in to million in  an increase of as a result of million increase in federal home loan bank borrowings

interest rates on interest bearing deposits increased by basis points from an average rate paid of in to in in  average demand deposit balances increased over provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  in as compared to  in as a result of the reduction in net loan charge offs from  in to  in  offset slightly by the increase in nonaccruing loans 
however  while nonaccruing loans have increased at year end  as compared to  the vast majority of the nonaccruing loans in were well secured with interest recognized on a cash basis 
provisions for loan losses are recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  particularly in sullivan county 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   and the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance s coverage of non performing loans was at december  compared to and at december  and respectively

management strives to identify potential non performing loans timely  take charge offs promptly based on a realistic assessment of probable losses  and maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses based on the inherent risk of loss in the existing portfolio 
no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any loan or group of loans  as the entire allowance is available to absorb charge offs in any loan category 
the amount and timing of future charge offs and allowance allocations may vary from current estimates and will depend on local economic conditions 
the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to major portfolio categories and the percentage of each loan category to total loans outstanding

nonaccrual and past due loans the company places a loan on nonaccrual status when collectability of principal or interest is doubtful  or when either principal or interest is days or more past due and the loan is not well secured and in the process of collection 
interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied as a reduction of the principal balance when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal

the majority of the company s total nonaccrual and past due loans are secured loans and  as such  management anticipates there will be limited risk of loss in their ultimate resolution 
nonaccrual loans increased million from  at december  to million at december  the majority of the increase arose from the transfer of million of commercial past due loans to nonaccrual status in all nonperforming loans are well collateralized with interest being recognized as received 
from time to time  loans may be renegotiated in a troubled debt restructuring when the company determines that it will ultimately receive greater economic value under the new terms than through foreclosure  liquidation  or bankruptcy 
candidates for renegotiation must meet specific guidelines

total non interest income of million in was an increase of or  over the increase is primarily attributable to the sale of the final three grandview palace units  eliminating all company owned real estate  and a  gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio 
the elimination of the one time gain on the sale of the credit card portfolio would have resulted in a decrease of  from to non interest expense increased by  or to million in salaries and employee benefit expense increased to million in this increase was caused by increased expenses for normal salary increases and increased costs of providing pension and healthcare benefits

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that the bank s management must continually perform to meet the objectives of maintaining stable net interest income and net interest margin 
this means that prior to setting the term or interest rate on loans or deposits  or before purchasing investment securities or borrowing funds  management must understand the impact that alternative interest rates will have on the bank s interest rate risk profile 
this is accomplished through simulation modeling 
simulation modeling is the process of shocking the current balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios and then measuring the impact of interest rate changes on both projected earning ands the economic value of the bank s equity 
the estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loan and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement rates on asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based on available information and current economic and general market conditions  management cannot make any assurance as to the ultimate accuracy of these assumptions including competitive influences and customer behavior 
accordingly  actual results will differ from those predicted by simulation modeling 
the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income from an instantaneous shift in all market interest rates 
the projected changes in net interest income are totals for the month period beginning january  and ending december  under instantaneous shock scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity table projected change in projected projected net interest projected dollar percentage income as a annualized change in change in percent of total net interest net interest net interest stockholders interest rate shock prime rate income income income equity no change  under an instantaneous interest rate shock  interest rates are modeled to change at once 
this is a very conservative modeling technique that illustrates immediate rather than gradual increases or decreases in interest rates 
many assumptions are embedded within our interest rate risk model 
these assumptions are approved by the asset and liability committee and are based upon both management s experience and projections provided by investment securities companies 
assuming our prepayment and other assumptions are accurate and assuming we take reasonable actions to preserve net interest income  we project that net interest income would decline by  or of total stockholders equity in a instantaneous interest rate shock and decline by  million or of stockholders equity in a instantaneous interest rate shock 
this is within our asset and liability policy guideline which limits the maximum projected decrease in net interest income in a or instantaneous interest rate shock to of the company s total equity capital 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk is impacted by general market conditions and customer demand 
generally we try to limit the volume and term of fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities  so that we can adjust it and pricing of assets and liabilities to mitigate net interest income volatility
