restatements of financial results the consolidated balance sheet at december  and the related consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity  and cash flows for the years ended december  and have been restated 
the restatement provided in this form k corrects amounts previously reported in allied s consolidated balance sheet at december  and the related statements of operations  stockholders equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended december  for certain errors related to incorrect currency rates used to translate mecar  sa s u 
s 
dollar denominated assets and liabilities into its functional currency  and for the grant of stock options to certain officers and directors in for which the actual accounting measurement date was after the measurement dates used by the company to record such awards 
the determination to restate the consolidated financial statements was approved by allied s audit committee of the board of directors upon the recommendation of allied s senior management 
in october  the company filed an amended form k and an amended form q for the quarter ended march  related to the company s failure to comply with the guidelines of fas regarding accounting treatment of its foreign currency hedge contracts at its belgian subsidiary  mecar  and the subsequent valuation of that subsidiary s assets and liabilities resulting from foreign currency transactions once the subsidiary failed to qualify for hedge accounting 
in the periods through  as the volume of us dollar sales contracts grew  mecar entered into foreign currency hedge contracts to control the subsidiary s exposure to currency risk from fluctuations in the us dollar as compared to the euro  its functional currency 
management and the audit committee determined that an additional restatement was necessary to correct foreign currency transaction and translation errors and correct certain reclassifications that were made in the previously reported amounts that were either incomplete or inaccurate 
in addition to the correction of previously reported amounts described above  this restatement also provides for the correction of compensation expense recorded in the years ended december  and in february  the compensation committee of the board of directors of allied granted stock option awards at the then market price  subject to subsequent approval by the stockholders of an amendment to the company s stock plan that would increase the number of shares available under that plan 
the stockholders approved the amendment to the plan in june the company incorrectly used the february award date as the measurement date for the options granted rather than the stockholder approval date in june the options granted were for  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the total compensation expense associated with this change in measurement date was  that should have been recognized over the vesting period of thirty four months subsequent to the measurement date 
based on the vesting period of the options  an increase to compensation expense of and was recognized in and  respectively 
the restatement also corrected the classification of mecar s bank overdraft facility from an operating activity for cash flow purposes to financing activity

mecar concluded its approximately  foreign military sales fms contract in the first quarter of and experienced lower sales activity for the remainder of the year 
mecar anticipated receiving two contracts totaling approximately  that would have replaced the fms contract concluded earlier in the year  but received neither contract by year end 
titan incurred a  net loss for on approximately  in revenue as the company recorded a tax valuation allowance for titan s deferred tax assets 
titan expects improved results in due to the indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contract received in mid mecar usa incurred a net loss for  as the business unit became operational in late given the continued delay of follow on orders from mecar s traditional customer base in financial performance is expected to be below pre historical levels 
the company expects a return of substantial business from these customers in within the electronic security segment  vsk recorded another profitable year in the business unit contributed  in revenue and  in net earnings  as vsk s export sales increased from prior levels 
nsm reported a  net loss in with approximately  of revenues  principally due to the failure to receive anticipated follow on contracts from the us army for operations in iraq  inventory reserves booked for obsolete and excess inventory levels and a tax valuation allowance recorded by the company 
nsm anticipates a substantial improvement in profitability full year vs full year nsm also expects significant growth over the next several years as the demand for its integrated surveillance solutions accelerates to meet growing demands from the department of defense as well as the needs of national  state and local law enforcement agencies and homeland security 
gms was aquired in november of gms incurred a net loss for  which included a first year write off of in process research and development iprd of 
for the other segment  seaspace incurred a  net loss for  principally due to a continual softening in demand for its ground station systems  the impairment of  in goodwill and the recording of a tax valuation allowance for seaspace s deferred tax assets 
seaspace expects increased revenue from antenna system sales and improved operating results from new management initiatives 
all business units spent considerable efforts on sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives  both in term of labor and dollars 
while was a challenging year for the company  given the disappointing financial results  the company has undertaken important changes  which include the following shifting its focus to two core operating segments  emphasizing business development at both corporate and operating unit levels  extending its planning horizon to incorporate a three year strategic plan for the company  prioritizing acquisitions to first complement its component strengths  then to focus on market development and new market penetration  and upgrading its financial systems and processes for effective and efficient operations and to ensure regulatory compliance 
allied concluded with a consolidated backlog of  compared with a consolidated backlog of  in in future periods  allied operations will continue to be impacted by mecar s ability to obtain large orders on a periodic basis and allied s ability to successfully continue its expansion of other business 
trends in liquidity and capital resources in  allied s liquidity deteriorated largely as a result of the losses incurred by several of allied s business units 
in march  the company refinanced its senior debt facility the patriot facility to address the liquidity issue 
on march   allied entered into a securities purchase agreement with several purchasers for the private placement of senior subordinated convertible notes in the principal amount of  and  warrants the warrants to purchase common stock of the company the transactions 
the notes accrue interest at a rate of per annum  subject to adjustment  with accrued interest payable quarterly in arrears in cash 
the interest rate of the notes steps down to once certain registration and financial milestones are attained 
the notes mature in and are convertible into shares of common stock of allied at a conversion price of  subject to standard anti dilution provisions 
the anti dilution provisions protect the rights of the noteholder from future potential issuances of the company s common stock  options  convertible securities or other related instruments 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  allied issued warrants to the purchasers exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of allied common stock 
the warrants are exercisable for a term of five years at an exercise price of per share  subject to anti dilution provisions similar to those included in the notes 
this financing enabled the company to retire a much higher senior note the patriot facility that was outstanding at december   thereby allowing the company to retain cash that would have otherwise been paid out in for principal and interest and eliminating the constraints on operations imposed by the covenants of the previous facility 
the company s goal is to enhance the strength of its balance sheet and provide flexibility to pursue its growth strategies 
as the net proceeds of this financing will likely by expended in company is in discussions with a senior lender to put in place a new senior secured facility to allow for additional liquidity and growth 
that senior facility is expended to be in the range of  to  availability under the line would accordion up to  based on future financial performance 
in the longer term  allied s liquidity will continue to depend on its ability to obtain substantial orders from its traditional customers and the success of its efforts to broaden its revenue base 
results of operations the results were affected by several significant items that are outlined below foreign exchange impact on the operations of the company s euro based business units the results were positively affected by the translation of the company s european operations euro based income statements into dollars at more favorable exchange rates 
all euro based results of operations were converted at the average  and exchange rates of  and us dollar to euro  respectively 
use of non hedge accounting for the company s foreign currency hedge transactions all data contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial consolidation and results of operation is based on the use of non hedge accounting 
as disclosed by the company in november  the company determined that it did not qualify for the use of hedge accounting in due to insufficient documentation of its foreign currency hedge transactions in addition to not qualifying in and accordingly  all the financial data contained herein has been prepared using non hedge accounting for such transactions 
change in application of accounting principle revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method in  mecar changed its methodology of applying the percentage of completion method for its revenues in an effort to better reflect the revenue recognized during the life of a sales contract 
previously  mecar used total direct costs as the basis for recognizing revenue 
in  mecar changed the basis for recognition to direct labor rather than total direct costs 
accordingly  the data contained herein shows the results under the new application method 
the and results are shown under the previous application method 
the following table sets forth  for the years ended december   and  certain items from allied s consolidated statements of earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue 
for the years ended december  restated restated revenues cost and expenses cost of sales selling and administrative research and development goodwill impairment operating income loss other income expense interest income for the years ended december  restated restated interest expense other net earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit earnings loss before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net earnings loss compared to compared to revenues 
the company s consolidated revenues for decreased approximately  from due to lower production activities and reduced contracts completed in the current year in the ammunition weapons effects  electronic security and the other segment 
in late  allied changed the composition of its business structure from the four segments used for management and reporting purposes in prior years into two primary operating segments in order to more accurately reflect the strategic focus of the company 
the table below shows revenues of the former and new segments for the three year period 
revenues by segment current segments restated restated ammunition weapons effects electronic security other the ammunition weapons effects segment revenue decreased  in from levels primarily from reduced revenues at mecar of  mecar concluded work on the approximately  foreign military sales fms contract in the first quarter of  and did not receive two substantial contracts  valued at  that were expected in lower revenue at mecar was only marginally offset by increases at titan and mecar usa of and  respectively 
on april   titan was awarded a firm fixed price  indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contract for the procurement of approximately  launchers and  cartridges and associated support for the battlefield effects simulator bes training system for the us army 
the contract will provide bes with support for target systems for digital multi purpose range complexes  digital multi purpose training range  and battlefield area complex 
delivery orders totaling million have been received under the contract through the end of the second quarter of the titan idiq contract represents the department of defense estimate of the amount that could be spent by all branches of service on training and simulation products provided by titan over a five to eight year period 
mecar usa commenced operations in late and received its first contract valued at approximately  the orders call for mecar usa to load  assemble  and pack mm high explosive plastic training practice tracer hep tp t ammunition for the us army s stryker program 
ammunition weapons effects segment revenues decreased in from levels due to reduced revenues at mecar  and titan 
the decrease in revenue at mecar stemmed from reduced activity on the fms contract 
titan revenue decrease resulted from lack of safety certification for its principal product 
titan revenue was largely comprised of cartridge sales for previously sold simulators and new e pyro products used for military and law enforcement training 
electronic security segment revenue decreased in from levels primarily from reduced revenues at nsm of  nsm did not receive several large contracts that were expected in these decreases were offset by increases at vsk and gms 
the increase at vsk of was principally the result of continued expansion of its export sales via its european distribution network 
in addition  gms was acquired in november and generated  of revenue 
electronic security segment revenue increased in over levels 
the increase of  at vsk is principally the result of continued expansion of its export sales via its european distribution network 
nsm s business improved by  due to receipt of additional us government orders in other segment revenues declined by and from the previous two years as it continued to face competitive pressures 
cost of sales 
cost of sales cos as a percentage of revenue was  and in  and respectively see table above 
the increase in cos percentage from to was driven by a year to year decline in mecar sales volumes and relatively fixed year to year cos expenses 
mecar usa and titan cos as a percentage of revenue actually improved from to  but not enough to offset the unfavorable movement at mecar cos within electronic security as a percentage of sales increased from to due to a significant decline in us based sales at nsm and a lack of a corresponding decrease in expenses partly offset by the acquisition of gms in november of vsk sales increased slightly from to vsk cos grew at a faster pace than sales resulting in less favorable performance 
seaspace had an increase in cos as a percentage of sales although the increase was not large enough to impact the consolidated results 
from to cos declined as a percent of revenue led by favorable trends at mecar  mecar usa  titan  nsm and at seaspace 
vsk trends in cos were generally flat to overall many of adg s segments operate within a relatively fixed cost environment 
sales declines on a year to year basis below these fixed costs levels can have an unfavorable impact on profitability 
the company is focused on reducing these breakeven points wherever it can on both a tactical and strategic level 
the company is also investing in business development and sales and marketing programs to ensure sales stay well above the break even levels 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative sa expenses as a percentage of sales were  and for  and respectively 
within awe sa expenses increased at mecar  mecar usa and titan 
after mecar sales failed to materialize in sa levels were cut back to preserve profitability  but not enough to offset the rapid decline in sales over that period 
mecar usa and titan costs increased as new facilities and staffing came on line in marshall  tx 
within the es segment vsk sa costs increased as a constant percentage of sales 
as nsm sales fell from to  sa costs remained relatively flat adversely impacting the percentage comparison 
allied headquarters cost also grew during the same period from approximately   and  for   and  respectively 
these increases were drive by higher staffing  compliance and audit costs 
the company is focused on reducing administrative costs across the board 
it is consolidating back office functions within the operating segments and is focused on significant reductions in compliance and audit costs by improving internal staffing levels and upgrading financial and manufacturing control systems in the us and belgium operations 
research and development 
research and development costs as a percentage of sales was  and for the years ended  and  respectively 
the total expense for research and development was  in as compared to  in and  in the general increase from stemmed from increased expenditures in the electronic security and other segment related to continued product development 
included in the research and development costs for is expense of related to in process research and development iprd costs that were part of the gms acquisition price that was written off in the total dollar outlays for research and development at mecar  vsk  nsm and seaspace are expected to remain at the same level for the coming year 
goodwill impairment 
as required by sfas no 
 the company performs a review of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year based on third quarter year to date results or earlier if an indicator of potential impairment of goodwill exists 
during  the company determined that the carrying amount of goodwill related to seaspace exceeded its fair value  which was estimated based on the present value of expected future cash inflows and the market capitalization of the company allocated on a component level to seaspace 
in  the company recorded goodwill impairment of  related to seaspace 
this impairment resulted from competition for seaspace s products and inability to meet historical and current projections 
interest income 
interest income increased steadily between and income earned on interest bearing accounts throughout the company has been affected by the higher interest rates despite overall lower cash levels at year end 
interest expense 
interest expense increased in over due principally to the interest and the amortization of debt issue costs on the senior debt facility 
in late  management undertook to refinance the senior debt facility  which was completed in march in contrast  interest expense decreased in from levels due principally to  of principal payments on a convertible debenture in that were not in place in other net 
other net expense increased in from primarily from the currency fluctuations 
in particular  mecar incurred higher currency losses  in this was offset by an approximate gain on the sale of mecar s ardenne firing range and related land 
other net in was expense of compared to expense of in pre tax profit 
in late  allied changed the composition of its business structure from the four segments used for management and reporting purposes in prior years into two primary operating segments in order to more accurately reflect the strategic focus of the company 
the table below shows the pre tax profit loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting estimate of the former and new segments for the two year period 
pre tax profit loss by segment current segments restated restated ammunition weapons effects electronic security other corporate within the ammunition and weapons effect segment  mecar incurred a substantial loss in while a significant portion of the decrease was expected due to the lack of a large high margin contract in mecar s backlog and the overall lower sales volume at mecar  the changes noted above were also affected by the voluntary change in revenue recognition policy in that represented an increased loss of approximately  electronic security segment incurred a loss in principally due to decreased business activity at nsm  largely from us government contracts 
nsm s performance suffered due to delays in award of orders 
vsk s pre tax profit was materially consistent between  and the addition of gms in november and the write off of in process research and development costs in the fourth quarter of of also impacted the loss for the current period 
other segment loss rose sharply in predominantly form the write down of goodwill at seaspace 
corporate segment loss increased in and due to sarbanes oxley implementation costs and audit costs particularly related to the company s accounting restatements at the corporate business unit 
note that corporate segment loss primarily represents the difference between intercompany management fees and expenses of the parent company 
income taxes expense benefit 
the effective income tax rates in   and were and  respectively 
the decreased rate for is attributed to significant losses with the us operations for which the company has recorded tax valuation allowances 
the decrease in the tax rate from the tax rate is attributed to increased utilization of foreign tax credits to reduce us taxes on foreign earnings 
the tax rate includes the impact of foreign dividends received in the us for which the related tax credits could not be fully utilized 
cumulative effect of accounting change net of income taxes 
in late  mecar changed its methodology for applying the percentage of completion in an effort to better reflect revenue recognized over the life of its sales contracts 
previously  mecar used total direct costs as the basis for recognizing revenue  but subsequently elected to use only direct labor as the basis of recognition 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change was  net of income taxes 
see further discussion in note c 
net earnings loss before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the company incurred a net loss in compared to net earnings in and the winding down of mecar s fms contract and the lack of replacement contracts was the principal cause of the net loss 
in addition to the reduction of contracts at mecar  the change in methodology for revenue recognition at mecar resulted in an additional loss of  net of taxes  in this increased loss was offset by the net income at vsk 
losses incurred by allied s other domestic subsidiaries continued 
the net earnings for decreased substantially from levels 
the decrease was the result of gains recognized in on derivative contracts at mecar 
there was also some decrease as a result of losses incurred by the company s us subsidiaries 
backlog 
as of december   the company s backlog was  compared to  at december  the and amounts included unfunded portions from an indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq federal contract awarded to nsm 
as previously noted  in  allied changed the composition of its business structure from the four segments used for management and reporting purposes in prior years into two primary operating segments in order to more accurately reflect the strategic focus of the company 
the table below shows the backlog of the former and new segments for the three year period 
backlog by segment current segments restated amount amount ammunition weapons effects electronic security other the increase in the backlog for the ammunition weapons effects segment is attributable to increases at mecar  titan  and the addition of mecar usa 
titan backlog reflects the orders under the idiq contract awarded in april mecar usa became operational in late and received its first contract valued at approximately  much of the increase in mecar s backlog is attributable to the change in the methodology of applying the percentage of completion method 
this change had the effect of shifting some amounts that would have been recognized as revenue in into the backlog at year end 
excluding the impact of the change in percentage of completion methodology  the mecar backlog would have had a slight decrease  due to the conclusion of work on the fms multi year contract awarded in february  as well as the depreciation of the euro during the year 
in addition to meeting the ammunition needs of its traditional customers  mecar has undertaken a customer diversification effort in the past few years  which has contributed to a majority of its new orders for and electronic security backlog decreased in a result of the decline in the nsm backlog  which is attributable to fewer new orders and completion of previously funded and unfunded contracts 
in addition  the backlog for vsk declined by  which is attributable to the completion of several contracts  as well as the depreciation of the euro during the year 
these decreases were offset by an increase from the acquisition of gms 
electronic security s and backlogs include unfunded portions of  and  respectively  from an idiq federal contract 
other segment backlog increased by in  otherwise  it has remained relatively constant over the two year period presented 
liquidity and capital resources the company incurred a net loss of  and had net cash used from operations of  in adg had a december  balance of cash and equivalents of  and restricted cash of  the company closed a  convertible debt facility in march net proceeds were   was used to retire existing debt including the patriot facility 
the remaining  was available to be used in to fund working capital needs 
as of june  the company had  of unaudited cash and equivalents and  unaudited of restricted cash 
as described in greater detail below  the company expects to expend nearly all of the net proceeds from the convertible note financing before december  and will likely explore other sources of additional liquidity pending the anticipated return of substantial business from mecar s traditional customer base 
the company expects positive cash flows to continue from us dollar based and euro based sources within the electronic security es segment 
euro based ammunition and weapons effects awe cash flow should be neutral through year end  turning positive in assuming that significant new orders are received from a key customer in the middle east 
should those orders not materialize by early further cost restructuring will be necessary to ensure a cash breakeven operation in contingency plans are being evaluated and pre positioned now should the current delays continue 
the us dollar based awe operations are being consolidated and downsized to lower the cash break even point 
capital projects can be delayed in early if cash resources are constrained 
the delay of these projects  if necessary  should not have a negative impact on the baseline revenues projected in at the headquarters level the company believes that the audit costs related to the restatement incurred in the first three quarters of will not be recurring in the company has invested in a financial and manufacturing erp system for all of its us subsidiaries and enhanced its headquarters financial staff 
these improvements should help the company significantly reduce its compliance and audit costs starting in the company has also invested in video conferencing facilities to link headquarters with all of the subsidiary locations  which should reduce travel costs from to the company is evaluating a variety of options to increase its liquidity in the fourth quarter of and into early the company intends to have in place  and is in the process of negotiating  a domestic line of credit by year end that will provide  to  of immediate liquidity with a provision to accordion up to  based on financial performance in subsequent periods 
the company is exploring possible asset backed financing from local banks at its us based awe facilities that would be earmarked for capital improvement buildings and or equipment at that site 
the company is evaluating the disposition of certain non strategic assets 
the company has the option of issuing dividends of excess cash from its euro based es operations at year end 
the company may further consolidate its california operations to further reduce operating expenses 
balance sheet 
all items on the company s december  consolidated balance sheet were affected by the decreased value of the euro in all euro based activity was converted at the december  and closing exchange rate of and us dollar to euro  respectively 
historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations and available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fully fund the company s operational needs 
working capital  which includes restricted cash  was  at december   which compares to  at december  working capital decreased mainly as a result of the loss from operations in cash decreased as a result of the net loss from operations and repayment of certain debt obligations offset by the increase in current liabilities 
restricted cash decreased based on the requirements of certain contracts at mecar 
accounts receivable decreased due to lower shipments in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased from year end primarily as a result of lower level of contracts worked on in at mecar 
inventories increased primarily from material purchases in anticipation of sales contracts at mecar 
the inventory buildup will give the subsidiaries  particularly mecar  the ability to deliver products with the shortest possible lead times 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts was a net liability of  at december   compared to an asset of  at december   which is due to the timing of the contracts and currency fluctuations 
mecar uses foreign currency derivative contracts to minimize the foreign currency exposures that arise from sales contracts that are denominated in foreign currency 
prepaid and other current assets increased primarily from prepaid taxes at mecar as well as receivable from the sale of mecar s firing range 
property  plant equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased primarily from the addition of fixed assets at mecar usa  which became operational in third quarter  and the addition of fixed assets related to the acquisition of gms in november  intangibles increased primarily from the gms acquisition which includes amounts for developed technologies  trade name and a non compete agreement 
goodwill increased as a result of the acquisition of gms on november  as well as the currency translation adjustment with vsk  net of a write down of goodwill at seaspace 
accounts payable at december  increased from december  mainly as a result of mecar s inventory purchases late in customer deposits increased primarily at mecar as a result of new contracts in in which mecar required deposits 
deferred compensation current in was associated with retirement obligations associated with an employee that was paid in early income taxes decreased due to the timing of tax payments 
convertible subordinated debenture  current and long term  decreased from december  to december  as the company commenced its monthly principal payments in june and made its final payment in march long term debt increased in over due to the acquisition of gms which included a  note payable to the seller and an additional  drawn down on the company s line of credit facility to fund the acquisition 
see notes j and l to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s credit facilities 
stockholders equity as of december   was negatively affected by the operating loss for and a decrease in the value of the euro versus the us dollar  which resulted in a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the euro depreciated by approximately during cash flows 
the table below provides the summary cash flow data for the periods presented for the years ended december restated restated net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities 
the company used  of cash in its operating activities during whereas it generated  of cash during the same period of this is attributed primarily to three factors 
first  the company has a loss from operations in of  after adjusting for non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  goodwill impairment  the cumulative effect of accounting change  and the write off of in process research and development  this loss was  as compared to  income in second  the company increased its inventory levels and had more expenditures related to prepaid expenses such as prepaid taxes at mecar 
third  the company collected less cash on shipments to customers 
in the prior year the company generated  of cash from the reduction of receivables levels as compared to only generated in cash paid for interest was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash paid for income taxes was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and includes federal  foreign and state taxes 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities increased between and this stemmed from the acquisition of gms  as well as higher capital expenditures for buildings and production equipment at the mecar usa and titan 
the company anticipates that cash generated from operations and financing using capital leases will be sufficient to support any further capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
future expenditures will be primarily incurred at mecar for machinery and equipment 
financing activities 
the company generated  of cash in financing activities during whereas it used  of cash during the same period of this mainly stemmed from the  draw down of the senior debt facility to finance the acquisition of gms and increased borrowings on mecar s overdraft facility 
in  there were substantial payments on short term borrowings and the convertible debenture  offset by proceeds of long term debt  in particular the senior secured facility 
the financing activities by operating subsidiaries are more fully explained below

the parent company continues to operate based on fees and dividends received from its subsidiaries 
allied has made cash infusions to seaspace  nsm and titan to support working capital requirements 
on may  the company obtained a senior loan facility under which the company could borrow up to  for acquisitions and working capital 
the facility contains both affirmative and negative financial covenants 
at december   the company was not in compliance with the terms of the agreement requiring the company to maintain at the end of the year earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation amortization ebitda of not less than  the company refinanced its senior debt facility in the first quarter of on march   allied entered into a securities purchase agreement with several purchasers for the private placement of senior subordinated convertible notes in the principal amount of  and related warrants to purchase common stock of allied the transactions 
the notes accrue interest at a rate of per annum  subject to adjustment  with accrued interest payable quarterly in arrears in cash 
the term of the notes is five years  and the notes are convertible into shares of common stock of allied at a conversion price of  subject to standard anti dilution provisions 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  allied issued warrants to the purchasers exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of allied common stock 
the warrants are exercisable for a term of five years at an exercise price of per share  subject to standard anti dilution provisions similar to the provisions set forth in the notes 
the company s goal is to enhance the strength of its balance sheet and provide flexibility to pursue its growth strategies 
the notes have been accounted for as a hybrid financial instrument and were valued at its fair value at inception 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the warrants were treated as a liability at march  mecar 
mecar continues to operate from internally generated cash and funds provided by its bank syndicate and financing from capital leases 
mecar also received cash from an affiliate to fund operations 
the bank syndicate agreement provides i lines of credit for tax prepayments and working capital and ii a facility for guarantees bonds to support customer contracts 
the financial lending terms and fees are denominated in euros and the dollar equivalents will fluctuate according to global economic conditions 
the bank agreement imposes two financial covenants requiring mecar to maintain minimum net worth and working capital levels 
as of december   mecar was not in compliance with these bank covenants  but is in the process of attempting to remediate the covenants with the banks 
mecar s obligations under the bank syndicate agreement continue to be collateralized by a pledge of mecar s assets 
the agreement includes allied s pledge to support mecar so that it remains in compliance with its total borrowing obligations 
vsk group

stock repurchases 
the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in and does not anticipate repurchasing any shares in contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
as described herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  allied has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect its financial condition 
however  based on management s assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and commercial commitments of allied  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on allied s financial condition or results of operations 
the following table identifies material contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period amount in s less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating leases foreign exchange contracts purchase obligations total contractual obligations commercial commitments total bank guarantees interest payments on long term debt which are excluded above are estimated to be    and for the above periods  assuming interest rates of  and for years thereafter 
the impact of the march refinancing have also been estimated for future periods 
see note y subsequent event of the consolidated financial statements for a description of the refinancing transaction 
mecar enters into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the currency risk associated with sales contracts that are set in a currency other than mecar s functional currency 
since mecar only enters these contracts to offset a sales contract amount  the company consides these obligations from foreign exchange contracts to be offset and thereby cash neutral and not required to be included in this schedule 
at december   the company had a net liability of  recorded for these contracts that will settle within nine months 
future liquidity 
the company is in discussions with an institutional lender to put in place a new senior secured facility to allow for additional liquidity and growth 
that senior facility is expected to be in the range of  in the longer term  allied s liquidity will continue to depend on its ability to obtain substantial orders from its traditional customers and the success of its efforts to broaden its revenue base 
the company s ability to cover its anticipated future operating and capital requirements is dependent upon its continued ability to generate positive cash flow from the operations of its subsidiaries  particularly the operations of mecar and vsk  and its ability to successfully integrate its acquisitions 
the company looks for acquisitions to be accretive to operations within months  although this cannot be assured 
this will depend upon many factors including the successful release of new product offerings  successful research and development efforts  and increased market share 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
mecar is required to provide performance bonds and advance payment guarantees for certain contracts  which are provided by mecar s bank syndicate 
mecar is obligated to repay the bank syndicate any amounts it pays as a result of any demands on the bonds or guarantees 
to date  there have never been any such demands 
at december   the company had  warrants  for the purchase of common stock  at an exercise price of outstanding 
these warrants were issued in accordance with the terms of the patriot senior debt facility at two warrants for each one thousand dollars borrowed and will expire on may  these warrants are considered equity in the company s financial statements pursuant to fas  accounting for derivatives and the emerging issues task force eitf the company s cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the us most of the amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us  but  under current law  would be subject to federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
allied has provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us the american jobs creation act of the act  enacted on october  the jobs act  provided for a temporary deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period for of dividends 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
the company elected to take the benefit of the deduction for the dividends it received from its foreign subsidiaries in the jobs act also included a qualified manufacturing deduction that applies to domestic manufacturers 
the deduction  when fully phased in  will provide a deduction of up to of qualified manufacturing income 
the deduction cannot be claimed by companies in a net operating loss carry forward position 
therefore  the company did not claim a benefit related to the qualified manufacturing deduction 
the company has not quantified the impact of the qualified manufacturing deduction that it can use once the net operating loss carry forward has been fully used 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note a to allied s consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
allied does not anticipate that any of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial results 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company s estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates or judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies which affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method goodwill and intangible asset valuation inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts derivative instruments valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on fixed price contracts for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method is used by mecar  mecar usa  nsm  and seaspace for substantially all of their fixed price sales contracts 
approximately  and of consolidated revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method during   and  respectively 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized on these contracts as work progresses during the period  using the percentage of direct labor incurred to total estimated direct labor at mecar and mecar usa or on a total cost incurred to total estimated cost basis nsm and seaspace 
management reviews these estimates as work progresses and the effect of any change in cost estimates is reflected in the calculation of the expected margin and the percent complete 
if the contract is projected to create a loss  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period such loss first becomes known 
accounting for the profit on a contract requires the total contract value  the estimated total direct labor cost to complete which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred labor costs to date on the contract and the estimated labor costs to complete the contract s scope of work and or the estimated total direct cost to complete to date on the contract and the estimated total direct costs to complete the contracts scope of work  and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the contract value and the estimated total cost at completion 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rates and efficiency variances and testing requirements 
while we believe that the systems and procedures used by the subsidiaries  coupled with the experience of their management teams  provide a sound basis for our estimates  actual results will differ from management s estimates 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
in  mecar changed its basis for applying the percentage of completion method in an effort to better reflect the revenue recognized over the life of its sales contracts 
previously  mecar used total direct costs as the basis for recognizing revenue  but subsequently elected to use direct labor as the basis of recognition 
see further discussion in note c 
revenue on contracts that do not qualify for the percentage of completion method are taken on a shipment basis 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation 
the company adopted fasb no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles with definitive lives and other costs 
as of december   the company has  of goodwill recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in conjunction with the implementation of the accounting rules for goodwill  the company completed a goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and determined that an impairment charge to earnings of approximately million was required see further discussion in note i 
as required by sfas no 
 the company will perform a similar review each year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future cash flows discounted at the company s weighted average cost of capital and a market capitalization approach 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
if market conditions in these business units fail to meet expectations  it could negatively impact revenue or cost  and could result in charges for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 
for intangible assets with definitive lives  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset 
as of december   the company had million of intangible assets with definitive lives  which includes patents  customer lists  trademarks  etc 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges to reflect the impairment of these assets 
impairment could also result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if the market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable pursuant to sfas for intangible assets with indefinite lives the company performs an impairment evaluation in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangibles 
at december  the company had  of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on an average cost basis 
the company s inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods of million as of december  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
the write down is based on current and forecasted demand and the age of the item  and therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts are evaluated based upon detailed analysis and assessment of receivables that may not be collected in the normal course of operations 
derivative instruments 
the company designates its derivatives based upon the criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the risk being hedged 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedge exposure effects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is reported in earnings immediately 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge  the change in fair value is recognized currently in net income 
the company believes that derivative accounting is critical to its estimates and financial reporting 
pursuant to sfas  hedge accounting and the subsequent restatements related to non hedge accounting have been material to the company s financial results for all periods reported and thereby represent a significant policy to the company 
looking forward  the company will look to effectively manage the accounting for its cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting 
the company believes hedge accounting provides financial results that better describe the underlying economics of the company s transactions rather than the results reported under non hedge accounting 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
the company is subject to taxation by federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time 
the company believes that it has recorded adequate liabilities and reviews those balances on a quarterly basis 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company and the industries in which it operates 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions future factors which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors include the following substantial reliance on mecar s principal customers to continue to acquire products on a regular basis  the cyclical nature of the company s military business  rapid technological developments and changes and the company s ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  the ability of the company to successfully continue to expand its business base  the ability of the company s acquired businesses to mature and meet performance expectations  the mix of products services  domestic and foreign governmental fiscal affairs and public policy changes which may affect the level of purchases made by customers  changes in environmental and other domestic and foreign governmental regulations  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate fluctuation from market conditions  general risks associated with doing business outside the united states  including  without limitation  import duties  tariffs  quotas and political and economic instability  the effects of terrorist actions on business activities  customer orders and cancellations  and the united states and international governments responses to these terrorist actions  changes in government regulations  liability and other claims asserted against us  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and continued availability of financing  financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts  at the times  and on the terms required to support the company s future business 
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors can arise and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates changes 
from time to time  we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
our derivatives are agreements with independent third parties that provide for payments based on a notional amount 
as of december  and  all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives 
however  we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties  all of whom we either consider credit worthy  or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate sensitivity 
allied manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at december   allied had approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness 
allied has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in under days or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end cash available for investment had been invested for the whole year including restricted cash  a change in interest rates would impact net interest income for the years ended december   and by million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  cash and restricted cash balances would increase by or million  million and million  at december   and  respectively 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt will also change based on interest rate changes 
exchange rate sensitivity 
allied maintains operations in several foreign countries 
approximately of the company s revenue was derived from operations outside the united states 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
allied s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the allied subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
allied does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in the value of the euro would impact reported net earnings for the years ending december   and by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
a change in the value of the euro would impact reported total assets for the years ended december   and by million  million and million  respectively 
see note p to the consolidated financial statements for more information on financial instruments 
allied does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does allied hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
allied regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program
