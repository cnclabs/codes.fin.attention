industry background in response to escalating health care costs  efforts in the health care industry have led to rapid growth in managed care and other cost containment programs 
despite these efforts  continued advances in medical technology  new drug development and increasing drug utilization have led to significant increases in health care costs 
this has created a need for more efficient  cost effective delivery and management of pharmacy services 
pharmacy benefit management companies evolved to address this need 
pbms provide the means for plan clients to deliver prescription drug benefits to their plan participants in a cost effective manner

claims management claims processing 
each client s plan participant is issued a health card which identifies the plan participant and the client 
the card may be utilized at any one of the pharmacies participating in our national pharmacy network and the client s plan 

table of contents we allow the plan participant to purchase approved prescription drugs and the other physician prescribed items  with the plan participant paying a deductible and or co payment amount  if any  to the pharmacy 
in the ordinary case  plan participants present their health card together with a physician s prescription to a participating pharmacy 
the pharmacist  using software conforming to industry standards  enters each claim into the pharmacy s computer and the claim is electronically communicated to us for on line real time processing 
if the prescription is for a drug listed on the client s approved drug list  our on line claims management system will confirm that the plan participant is eligible for benefits and that the submitted claim is in conformity with the plan s terms and conditions  and the pharmacist is advised of the appropriate co payment and deductible  if any  to be collected from the plan participant 
the on line claims management system will also advise the pharmacist of the payment the pharmacy will receive from us 
in addition  our on line claims management system sends appropriate messages regarding preferred drugs  contraindications  or any number of other potential interventions  based upon plan participant s existing claims history with us 
the prescription is then dispensed by the pharmacist to the plan participant  who pays the appropriate co payment and or deductible amount and signs a signature log maintained by the participating pharmacy 
plan participants are provided with a list of pharmacies participating in our pharmacy network 
plan participants may alternatively choose to fill prescriptions at a non participating pharmacy and would then have to submit a paper claim to us for reimbursement 
occasionally a plan participant s claim is rejected or a prior authorization is required based on plan parameters  in which case the participant may be referred to the client directly or to our customer service department 
invoicing and payments 
clients are generally charged i an administration fee for each prescription claim processed by us  ii an amount for the drug dispensed  and iii a dispensing fee for filling such prescription 
clients pay us such amounts and we pay an individually negotiated amount to the participating independent or chain pharmacies  which amount may be at a discount to the amount charged to the clients 
plan participants filing for direct payment receive an allowable payment which is usually specified by the client 
see the company pharmacy network hereof 
rebate administration 
drug manufacturers may issue rebates in connection with the use of certain prescription drugs in accordance with our formulary programs 
pursuant to an agreement between us and our wholly owned subsidiary  specialty pharmacy care  inc spc  we submit claims for rebates to spc for certain of our clients 
spc performs the services of a rebate administrator for which it is paid an administrative fee 
spc has entered into agreements with drug manufacturers to collect rebates for our clients 
we enter into a separate set of agreements with drug manufacturers for our clients receiving rebates under the medicare part d program 
the terms of each agreement between spc and the drug manufacturers are unique  but the basic concept is the same 
such agreements generally provide that we must list the specified products of each of the drug manufacturers on our approved formularies with the specified clients 
our independent pharmacy therapeutics p t committee determines and approves the inclusion of such drugs on our formularies prior to listing the products on any approved formularies 
for a discussion of the p t committee  see formulary design and disease information services 
in order to qualify for rebates  we may not refer  either directly or indirectly  any competing products over the specified drug manufacturer s products except for reasons of medical appropriateness 
the contracted drug manufacturers are obligated to pay rebates within a specified period of time after we submit our claims  based on agreed upon specified percentages which can vary based on certain contractual criteria 
the manufacturer contracts provide for either i a fixed percentage rebate with or without market share based enhanced opportunities or ii a market share based rebate 
in the latter case  rebates may not be earned in the event that a minimum market share threshold is not achieved 
in addition  we are typically paid an administrative fee by the manufacturers for our services in administering these contracts 
all  part  or none of the rebates received by us from drug manufacturers or the rebate administrators may be remitted to certain of our clients  depending upon the terms of our agreements with each client 
from july  through june   we submitted claims for rebates for specified clients pursuant to an agreement with a rebate administrator the former administrator 
based on that agreement  the payment of rebates was contingent upon nmhc adopting the former administrator s formulary for our specified clients 

table of contents we submitted the claims for the specified clients to the former administrator 
the former administrator submitted our rebate claims  and could submit such claims along with rebate claims of others  to the appropriate drug manufacturer  pursuant to the agreements the former administrator had negotiated with these drug manufacturers 
our agreement with the former administrator provided that it would be obligated to pay us a per claim rebate amount  within a specified period of time after each quarter 
the former administrator retained a portion of the total rebates as an administrative fee 
the term of the agreement with the former administrator was due to expire on december  however  the former administrator terminated this agreement with us on june  we expect to enter into alternative arrangements with a third party rebate administrator for these services by october pharmacy network we maintain a pharmacy network that includes both retail and mail service options 
we also maintain a comprehensive multi state network of participating pharmacies 
both the retail and mail service components of the pharmacy network  including our own mail service facility  are managed through our on line claims management system 
certain of our clients require us to maintain a pharmacy network with specified numbers of pharmacies in various locations to serve plan participants 
our retail pharmacy network consists of over  pharmacies 
our agreements with many pharmacies do not require us to make payments within a specified period 
however  we know from experience that timely payment is a significant consideration of the pharmacies 
the loss of a national pharmacy chain in our pharmacy network could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see item hereof 
benefit design consultation we assist clients in defining their financial and employee benefit objectives for their prescription drug benefit plans and in developing a program to meet such objectives 
our staff analyzes and provides recommendations to clients regarding how to improve their plan performance based upon the client s objectives 
general areas of focus include participant cost sharing levels ie  deductibles and co pays  covered and excluded drugs  generic drug usage  clinical and utilization management strategies  alternate programs and services  maintenance medication programs  and medicare part d services 
once a plan design has been implemented  the clinical and account management staff monitors plan performance for customer satisfaction and cost effectiveness  and may periodically recommend changes to the plan 
drug review and analysis our drug review and analysis services include prospective reviews of potential claims and concurrent and retrospective reviews of submitted claims 
these include a series of on line reviews which permit a pharmacist filling a prescription to examine the plan participant s claims history for drug interactions premature refills of prescriptions duration and duplication of therapy pregnancy and breast feeding precautions geriatric or pediatric precautions compliance with prescriptions other contraindications 
table of contents we transmit such information to the dispensing pharmacist for information purposes only not to replace the prescribing physician s or the dispensing pharmacist s professional judgment 
our clinical pharmacists retrospectively analyze the drug utilization patterns of plan participants for each client 
we may then recommend changes in the client s plan design  preferred drug management and disease information systems initiatives to contain costs or to better serve the plan participants 
formulary design and disease information services formulary design 
we have established a p t committee currently comprised of physicians and pharmacists  with independent provider representation from across the country 
the p t committee s primary responsibility is to assist clients in designing a well managed  therapeutically appropriate  cost effective preferred drug listing or formulary 
the goal of the p t committee is to enable clients to optimize plan participant care through drug policy development and education 
the p t committee typically meets quarterly and performs the following functions provides information to clients to ensure that the covered drugs of each plan reflect the current standard of medical practice and pharmacology  evaluates drugs for clinical efficacy prior to cost considerations for inclusion in a plan as a preferred drug  analyzes current literature for safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness of covered drugs  provides recommendations on drug therapy and utilization  evaluates drug review and analysis programs and criteria  recommends those drugs which require prior authorization from the client  and reviews the associated guidelines for those drugs proper use 
the committee currently consists of nine members plus the chairman  each with expertise in specific practice areas 
in addition  consultants to this core may be called upon to participate on an ad hoc basis 
we believe that the p t committee is organized and operates in a manner that ensures the objectivity and credibility of its recommendations 
we strive to provide our clients with a formulary that promotes the most clinically appropriate and cost effective medications in drug therapy  independent of manufacturer bias 
disease information services 
through our disease information services  we provide information to clients that is intended to enable them to enhance their prescription benefit plans and to improve the treatment of plan participants with certain medical conditions 
in providing disease information services  based upon recommended drug and treatment guidelines  we review and analyzes drugs prescribed and prescriptions dispensed  recommend plan guidelines  and conduct plan participant and physician profiling 
by analyzing plan participants pharmacy claims patterns  we can provide information to clients and health care providers  assisting in the early identification of patients whose care might be improved through additional or alternative medication treatments 
we have developed disease information systems covering cardiovascular and gastrointestinal conditions  behavioral health  migraines  diabetes and asthma  among others 
our disease information services utilize the recommended drug and treatment guidelines  changes in the drug and treatment guidelines  current medical literature and its own assessments to identify plan participants at risk for a particular disease 
if the disease information services identify participants at risk for particular diseases  we may provide the recommended drug and treatment guidelines to clients  treating physicians and plan participants 
if requested by the client  we monitor a participant s compliance with the recommended drug and treatment guidelines  including prescription usage 

table of contents if it appears  based upon our analysis of the participant s claims history  that the recommended drug and treatment guidelines are not being applied  we may  if requested by the client  contact the physician  via either telephone or letter  suggesting additional options 
physician performance and adherence to the recommended drug and treatment guidelines are monitored by using our information systems 
data access  reporting and information analysis our on line claims management system enables us to efficiently provide clients with on line system access whereby the client is able to update and maintain certain plan areas such as participant eligibility  periodic utilization and financial reports  which our representatives utilize to assist clients regarding benefit design  cost containment initiatives  disease information initiatives  generic equivalents programs and formulary management  and plan performance indicators and ad hoc reporting through our proprietary decision support tool  known as info 
physician profiling we will  at the request of either a physician or a client  analyze ie  profile a physician s prescription history and consult with either the physician or the client about the physician s prescribing pattern 
we might  for example  discuss alternatives to therapies that the physician regularly prescribes based on the drug and treatment guidelines 
this practice is designed to enhance the therapeutic benefits received by the plan participant and  where possible  to achieve cost savings 
it is also designed to promote conformity with plan benefits and the recommended drug and treatment guidelines 
medicare part d program the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the mma created the federal voluntary prescription drug benefit program under part d of the social security act 
as of january   eligible medicare beneficiaries are able to obtain prescription drug coverage under part d by enrolling in a pdp or a medicare advantage plan that offers prescription drug coverage a ma pd 
employers and unions offering eligible prescription drug coverage for their medicare eligible members can receive a number of subsidies payments under part d for a portion of the costs associated with providing such coverage to beneficiaries who do not enroll in a pdp or ma pd 
these subsidies can be obtained by the employer group by contracting directly or indirectly with cms to offer pdp medicare benefits to medicare eligible members  or the employer group can apply for a retiree drug subsidy without contracting with a pdp sponsor 
we participate in the administration of the medicare drug benefit i through the provision of pbm services to our health plan and other clients that have qualified as a pdp or a ma pd  and ii by assisting employers  unions and other clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy available under medicare part d by collecting and submitting eligibility and or drug cost data to cms for them in order to obtain the subsidy 
we provide new part d functions to these clients that include managing member true out of pocket costs troop  creation of the prescription data event pde  medication therapy management mtm services  and various reporting required by cms 
in addition  our wholly owned subsidiary  nmhc group solutions  has been approved by cms to be a pdp sponsor commencing on january  we expect to enter into a formal agreement with cms in the fourth quarter of to operate as a pdp sponsor 
under this contract  nmhc group solutions will be able to offer the pdp medicare benefits both to individual enrollees and to employer groups wishing to contract indirectly with part d to offer a pdp to eligible members 
as an approved pdp sponsor  we would also be able to operate as a risk bearing entity for the individual enrollees and to employer groups 
as of now  we don t have any risk contracts 

table of contents mail service mail service pharmacy is generally used by plan participants as a cost effective means of minimizing the inconvenience resulting from repeated trips to retail pharmacies to fill prescriptions  this is especially common when a plan participant with a chronic condition receives long term drug therapy 
in addition  the plan participant generally saves money through a reduction in the number of co payments they would have paid had the prescriptions been filled repeatedly at a retail pharmacy 
further  with mail service pharmacy  the client is typically charged a lower dispensing fee and a lower cost for prescription ingredients compared to those charged by a retail pharmacy 
we opened our mail service pharmacy  nmhc mail order  inc  operating out of miramar  florida on july  plan participants submit prescriptions  primarily for maintenance medications  to mail service via mail 
refill requests may be submitted via mail  telephone  fax or the internet 
the operations of mail service are automated  featuring bar code and scanning technology to route and track orders  computerized dispensing of medications and computer generated mailing labels 
to ensure quality control of the dispensation of prescriptions  mail service is equipped with automated quality control features and a licensed pharmacist who inspects each prescription 
claims submitted by mail service are managed using our on line claims management system and are subject to the same review and verification as those claims submitted by retail pharmacies 
specialty service specialty service manages high cost self injectable medications and compounded prescriptions requiring special handling for some of its clients and for medicaid and medicare recipients 
recently  this class of medications has become a more significant percentage of our clients pharmacy budget 
this growth is a function of increased utilization as well as an increase in the number of available treatment agents 
diseases treated by specialty pharmacy medication include hepatitis c  hemophilia  growth deficiency  respiratory syncytial virus rsv  multiple sclerosis  hiv  immune deficiency  crohn s disease  pompe s disease  gaucher s disease  psoriasis  infertility  oncology and oncology adjunct  rheumatoid arthritis  osteoporosis  cystic fibrosis  osteoarthritis  macular degeneration  organ transplant and women s health 
the specialty pharmacy services manage utilization of these agents on two levels first  at a macro level  by identifying trends in utilization patterns  recommending protocols based on nationally accepted guidelines  and monitoring compliance  second  on a micro level  by specialty service managing guidelines for its patients to ensure appropriate dispensing and ongoing compliance 
in addition  we aid clients in identifying patients for our specialty program either through medical claims information provided by the client or in conjunction with existing drug profiles 
once identified  patients may receive some  or all  of the following services delivery to a location of the patient s choice home delivery or delivery to the patient s primary care physician or specialist  educational materials about therapies and disease states  drug and disease information services  refill management and compliance monitoring  pharmacist hotline  assignment of benefits  and study protocols and financial assistance program information 

table of contents along with providing the above services  specialty service has relationships with biotech and drug manufacturers to be a part of their dispensing network of pharmacies 
our clients agreement with clients our clients are located throughout the united states and its territories 
clients include managed care organizations  local governments  unions  corporations  hmo s  employers  third party health care plan administrators and federal and state government programs 
our clients are typically asked to sign a standard form of agreement that governs and states our relationship with that client the standard agreement 
while our clients may negotiate other agreements with us  many clients sign our standard agreement or a modified version of the standard agreement 
pursuant to this standard agreement  we pay claims and furnish other related services through a network of pharmacies 
the client provides the details of the plan to be managed  along with a list of all covered participants and eligibility updates 
the client is liable for all charges incurred by unauthorized access unless we were notified in writing or electronically of ineligibility 
we are obligated to ensure that an adequate number of member pharmacies are available  furnish a description of the plan to the pharmacies  require such pharmacies to comply with the member pharmacy agreement  and accurately process claims in accordance with the client s benefit plan design 
in addition  we are required to furnish the client with an invoice which includes a summary of claims costs in the preceding period and an accounting of the cost of claims 
under our standard agreement  the client is obligated to pay the cost of claims to us as invoices are received by the client 
the invoice will also include an administrative fee due to us for the auditing  approval and payment of claims processed during the preceding period 
the client typically agrees to make all payments within a specified period after the billing cycle 
we bill the client separately for additional charges  which the client is typically required to remit within days after receipt of the invoice from us 
we agree to maintain adequate records for the client to determine its cost of drugs and the client may review these records 
the specific financial arrangements in the agreement with the client are negotiated between us and the client on a case by case basis 
while we may take into account factors such as the number of plan participants  margins and economies of scale  among others  in determining the terms of our financial arrangements with clients  we generally do not use set guidelines when determining these terms 
significant clients for the year ended june   approximately of our gross dollar value of all prescriptions filled was from mohawk valley physicians health plan  inc mvp  a client administering multiple plans  which is reported within the pbm segment 
on may   mvp notified us that they will not be renewing their contract with us which expires on december  our business strategy our business strategy is focused on organic growth  together with opportunistic acquisitions of specialty pharmacy and pbm businesses 
we plan to grow organically by leveraging our core strengths to meet specific  unmet needs within defined market segments  resulting in added pbm lives and increased utilization of our mail and specialty services 
target markets our business strategy is focused on further penetrating the following five market segments unions taft hartley trust funds with large active and retiree populations  this market segment requires the services that comprise our complete suite of core offerings  including pbm  specialty service  mail service and medicare part d 
as rising healthcare costs continue to squeeze fund assets  local and international unions are becoming increasingly attracted to our brand of innovative  results oriented clinical programs 

table of contents in addition  our history of offering pass through pricing and transparency remains extremely important to retaining our current clientele as well as winning new business 
employer groups self insured companies with  lives are challenged by cost containment pressures on the one hand and the need to offer attractive benefit packages that attract and retain employees on the other 
this calls for increased sophistication on the part of pbms  which we are ideally positioned to offer  relative to smaller pbms 
the market is under serviced by the three largest pbms and is attracted to our flexibility  dedication and service levels and our strong clinical programs 
we see strong opportunities for growth and expansion in this market as employers continue to search for solutions to their rising healthcare costs 
state and local governments similar to our union or taft hartley fund clients  public sector enterprises provide pharmacy benefits to both employees and retirees and as a result are likewise attracted to the complete suite of our offerings 
our results oriented approach to clinical programs remains important to a client base that must often face public scrutiny 
legislation  as well as political trends requiring pass through pricing and transparent contracting  favors our strength and experience  while at the same time many other pbms are unwilling or unable to offer such terms 
we see many opportunities to capitalize on these market dynamics 
third party administrators tpas the tpa market is consolidating under the constant pressure of large health insurance companies  such as blue cross blue shield  united  cigna  and aetna 
these potential clients  who process claims for employers and taft hartley funds  seek partnerships with pbms that can help them offer a competitive advantage 
managed care organizations mcos we are ideally positioned to service the needs of mid sized  regional mcos with  to  lives 
these firms are large enough to demand the services of an integrated  technically sophisticated pbms like nmhc  but not large enough to bring pbm services in house 
to compete in their service areas  these firms must be able to offer unique and flexible offerings  coupled with outstanding clinical and financial results from intervention programs 
they demand high levels of service  support for their own p t committees  locally tailored retail networks  and other levels of customization that are going unmet by larger pbms that service larger mcos 
our track record in this market and transparent business practices are expected to help drive growth in this sector 
company operations sales and marketing we market our services through a sales and marketing department led by a direct sales force of regional vice presidents and external brokerage and consultant relationships 
our regional vice presidents target clients throughout the united states and its territories 
in addition  we contract with brokers and consultants who are retained to market our services to prospective clients for agreed upon fees 
we also attend trade shows and uses advertising  public relations and marketing literature for sales support 
these efforts are expected to yield continuous improvements to our relationships with existing clients as well as to create access to new customers in major marketing areas 
furthermore  we continue to expand our web presence www 
nmhc 
com as both a functional tool for clients to conduct the many value added services provided by us  and as a portal for eligible plan participants to make inquiries and place orders 
the web site offers a page dedicated to online services which allow plan participants to fill out customer service surveys  to obtain direct payment claim forms  and to access the pharmacy network listings 
in addition  we use our web presence to make available specific resources to clients who have unique reporting and data management requests  including plan participant access to claims history 
all plan participant information is subject to security measures available in the industry  protecting patient confidentiality and meeting the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa compliance standards 

table of contents information systems information systems play a critical role in our business 
claims adjudication software is one of our most critical systems and directly supports our core business operations 
this system provides a wide range of functionality including online claims processing  formulary and clinical management  pharmacy network management and is the basis for much of our reporting and analytical capabilities 
this key system depends in large part on software licensed from unaffiliated third parties 
by a license agreement dated october   we were granted non exclusive and non transferable perpetual licenses to use these unaffiliated third parties claims adjudication software systems 
we maintain preventative measures to protect against disaster  including redundancy in processing  telecommunications and power sources 
suppliers on july   mail service entered into a month agreement with a wholesale distributor  amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc  to be the primary supplier of pharmaceuticals for its mail service operations 
on may   mail service entered into a new agreement with abdc that replaces the prior agreement 
the new agreement expires on april  and extends on a month to month basis until either party gives at least days notice to the other to its intent not to extend the term of the agreement 
we are currently negotiating other supplier contracts as well 
we believe that our supplier arrangements will be adequate to fulfill our needs 
specialty service also utilizes abdc for its purchases  as well as biotech firms for some of the newer drugs it provides 
competition we compete with numerous companies which provide the same or similar services 
some of our competitors have been in existence for longer periods of time and are better established than we are 
some of them also have broader public recognition  substantially greater financial and marketing resources than us  and more experienced management 
in addition  some of our clients and potential clients may find it desirable to perform for themselves those services now being rendered by us 
furthermore  there is a distinct possibility that consolidation and alliances within the industry will adversely impact the operations and prospects for independent pharmacy benefit management companies such as nmhc 
our ability to attract and retain clients is substantially dependent on our capability to provide efficient and accurate claims management  utilization review services and related reporting  auditing and consulting services 
we believe that the following factors help us successfully compete a successful record of delivering lower annual costs for our clients than national trends  a broad base of experience in the information technology and pharmacy benefit management industries  flexible and sophisticated on line information systems  which integrate all of the data input  reporting  analysis  and access functions provided by nmhc  wholly owned and operated mail service and specialty pharmacies  an integrated medicare part d prescription drug program  effective and measurable clinical management programs  a focus on customer service  and transparency to clients 

table of contents employees as of september   we had employees 
of the total employees  are full time and are part time employees 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory 

table of contents government regulation the activities of pbms such as nmhc are subject to regulation at the federal and state levels 
we believe that our operations  as currently conducted  substantially comply with the laws and regulations material to the operation of our business 
however  the application of complex standards to the detailed operations of our business creates areas of uncertainty 
regulatory authorities have very broad discretion to interpret and enforce these laws and to promulgate corresponding rules and regulations 
violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal and or civil fines and penalties  injunctive relief to prevent future violations  other sanctions  loss of professional licensure and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs  including medicare and medicaid 
there can be no assurance that we have interpreted the applicable laws and regulations in the same way as regulatory or judicial authorities  or that the laws and regulations and or the interpretation thereof will not change 
to date  our business activities and relationships with clients  pharmacies  rebate administrators  plan participants and brokers have not been the subject of regulatory investigation or review on either the state or federal level 

table of contents moreover  the states and federal government continue to propose new legislation that may  if enacted  have a material adverse effect on our business  profitability or growth prospects 
a more detailed analysis of certain laws and regulations and proposed legislation affecting the business  operations and relationships of nmhc is set forth below 
anti kickback statutes the federal anti kickback statute prohibits knowingly paying or receiving remuneration in return for referring an individual for the furnishing of an item or service  or for the purchasing  ordering or arranging for any item or service  for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federally funded health care program  including medicare  medicaid and the civilian health and medical program of the uniformed services  champus tricare 
regulations have been adopted under the federal anti kickback statute which provide safe harbors for certain remuneration arrangements that might otherwise violate the statute  such as properly reported discounts including certain rebates received from vendors and properly disclosed payments made by vendors to group purchasing organizations 
the failure to fall within a safe harbor does not automatically mean that an arrangement is unlawful  although it may result in heightened scrutiny or challenge 
many states  including several in which we do business  have adopted laws similar in scope to the federal anti kickback statute sometimes including similar safe harbors  and these state laws often are applicable to services for which payment may be made by anyone  including commercial insurers and private pay patients  not just payments made under a federal health care program 
violation of these anti kickback laws may result in criminal and civil penalties as well as exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
the federal anti kickback statute has been broadly interpreted by the courts  the office of inspector general the oig of the department of health and human services hhs  and pertinent administrative bodies 
courts have ruled that a violation of the statute exists even if only one purpose of the remuneration was to induce patient referrals or purchases 
also  the oig has identified as possibly improper under the statute so called product conversion programs  pursuant to which pharmaceutical manufacturers provide incentives to physicians and pharmacies to change a prescription to a drug made by the pharmaceutical manufacturer  or recommend such a change 
we are not aware of any instance in which the federal anti kickback statute has been applied i to prohibit independent pbms  such as nmhc  from receiving rebates from drug manufacturers based on drug sales by pharmacies to plan participants  or ii to properly structure contractual relationships between independent pbms and their clients and participating pharmacies 
the federal anti kickback statute has also been cited as a partial basis for investigations and multi state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to retail pharmacies in connection with product conversion programs 
additionally  certain governmental entities have commenced investigations of companies in the pharmaceutical services industry and have identified issues concerning development of preferred drugs lists  therapeutic substitution programs  pricing of pharmaceutical products and discounts from prescription drug manufacturers 
several pharmaceutical manufacturers have entered into settlement agreements with the federal government concerning marketing and pricing practices 
for example  in september  caremark rx  inc  a pbm  entered into a million civil settlement of claims that its subsidiary  advancepcs  allegedly solicited and received kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers in the form of excessive administrative fees  over priced services agreements as a reward for favorable formulary treatment  and improper flat fee rebates  and that advancepcs allegedly paid kickbacks to customers and potential customers to induce them to contract with advancepcs 
although the case settled under the false claims act  discussed below  a majority of the allegations pertained to anti kickback violations 
further  at least one state has filed a lawsuit concerning similar issues against a health plan 
we believe that we are in compliance with the federal anti kickback statute and similar state laws and to date  we have not been the subject of any such suit or investigation 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not be subject to challenge or a proceeding under the federal anti kickback statute  the regulations there under or any similar state laws 

table of contents any such challenge or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition  regardless of whether we are found to have violated such statutes or regulations 
on april   the oig issued its compliance program guidance for pharmaceutical manufacturers oig guidance aimed at advising pharmaceutical manufacturers on how to establish compliance programs that will ensure compliance with state and federal laws and regulations 
the oig guidance encourages pharmaceutical manufacturers to evaluate some areas of legal risk in structuring their compliance program  including the relationship between pharmaceutical manufacturers and pbms 
in particular  the oig guidance describes the negotiation of discount rebates and administration fees  as well as formulary support activities  as areas of potential legal risk 
although we believe that our business practices and direct arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers are in compliance with the oig guidance  we cannot guarantee that the arrangements between our third party rebate administrator and the pharmaceutical manufacturers are in compliance with the oig guidance 
in addition  if the industry perceives the oig guidance as leading to greater scrutiny of pbms  pharmaceutical manufacturers and clients may seek to alter rebate arrangements  which could adversely affect our profitability 
medicare part d prescription drug program reforms the mma  which was enacted in  creates a new voluntary prescription drug benefit under the social security act 
the mma initially established a transitional voluntary  medicare endorsed prescription drug discount card program medicare card program  effective as of june   which is to remain in place until completion of the initial open enrollment in the medicare drug program ended may  pbms played a central role in the medicare card program  either through direct client contracts with cms or indirectly as a subcontractor to an endorsed client of the medicare card program 
we have entered into a contract with member health  inc  an endorsed client  for the provision of rebate administration services to enrollees in member health inc s medicare card program 
specifically  we negotiated and entered into rebate agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers and collected rebates on behalf of the enrollees for the medicare card program 
in return  we received an administrative fee for our services 
the medicare card program ended in may beginning in january  medicare beneficiaries entitled to part a or enrolled in part b  as well as certain other medicare enrollees  are eligible for outpatient prescription drug benefits under the mma medicare part d drug program 
on january   cms issued final rules implementing the portions of the mma relating to pdps and ma pds 
the mma imposes various requirements on pdp sponsors and ma pds that offer drug coverage  including requirements relating to the prescription drug benefits offered  the disclosure of negotiated price concessions made available by drug manufacturers  pharmacy access and participation  and the development and application of formularies 
to the extent that we serve as a pdp sponsor or provide services to pdp sponsors and ma pds  we will be required to comply with the applicable provisions of the mma and cms regulations 
although we are continuing to assess the impact that medicare part d will have on our clients decisions to continue to offer a prescription drug benefit to their medicare eligible members  our clients will have a variety of options to consider for providing drug coverage to their retirees 
we currently participate in the administration of medicare part d i through the provision of pbm services to our health plans and other clients that have qualified as a pdp or a ma pd  and ii by assisting employers  unions and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy available under medicare part d by collecting and submitting eligibility and or drug cost data to cms for them in order to obtain the subsidy 
in addition  our subsidiary  nmhc group solutions  which has been approved by cms as a pdp sponsor under medicare part d for  will begin offering medicare part d pharmacy benefits to employer groups commencing  subject to entering into a formal contract with cms during the fourth quarter of this will be the first time we are a direct contractor to the federal government and subject to the rules  regulations and enforcement authority of the federal government over its contractors 
in all cases  we will be required to comply with the extensive  detailed requirements of the medicare laws and regulations which could have a significant impact on our operations  products and services 

table of contents stark law the federal physician self referral law  known as the stark law  prohibits physicians from referring medicare or medicaid beneficiaries for designated health services  including outpatient prescription drugs  to any entity with which the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has a financial relationship 
the law also prohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim to medicare or medicaid for the designated health service furnished under the prohibited referral 
in addition  the stark law contains certain statutory and regulatory exceptions for physician referrals and physician financial relationships 
cms published final regulations under the stark law which provides guidance on interpretation of the scope and exceptions of the stark law 
possible penalties for violation of the stark law include denial of payment  refund of amounts collected in violation of the statute  civil monetary penalties  criminal penalties and medicare and medicaid program exclusion 
our specialty and mail service pharmacies dispense certain outpatient prescription drugs that may be directly or indirectly reimbursed by the medicare or medicaid programs  potentially making them subject to the stark law s requirements 
however  we do not believe that we receive any physician referrals that would violate the stark law 
state self referral laws our mail service and specialty pharmacy operations may also be subject to state statutes and regulations that prohibit payments for referral of individuals from or by physicians to health care providers with whom the physicians have a financial relationship 
these state laws and their exceptions may vary from the federal stark law and vary significantly from state to state 
some of these state statutes and regulations apply to items and services reimbursed by private payors 
violation of these laws may result in prohibition of payment for items or services provided  loss of pharmacy or health care provider licenses  fines and criminal penalties 
state self referral laws are often vague  and  in many cases  have not been widely interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies 
nonetheless  we believe we are in substantial compliance with such laws 
statutes prohibiting false claims and fraudulent billing activities a range of federal and state civil and criminal laws target false claims and fraudulent billing activities 
one of the most significant of these laws is the federal false claims act  which imposes civil penalties for knowingly making a false claim or the making of a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from a government sponsored program  such as medicare and medicaid 
a few federal district courts have recently interpreted the false claims act as applying to claims for reimbursement that violate the federal anti kickback statute or the stark law under certain circumstances 
in recent years  the federal government has launched several initiatives aimed at uncovering practices that violate false claims or fraudulent billing laws 
claims under these laws may be brought either by the government or by private individuals on behalf of the government through a whistleblower action 
because such actions are filed under seal and may remain secret for years  there can be no assurance that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are named in a material action 
the false claims act and other related or similar laws generally provide for the imposition of civil penalties and for treble damages  resulting in the possibility of substantial financial penalties for small billing errors that are replicated in a large number of claims as well as potential criminal penalties 
the federal government has entered into settlement agreements with several companies in the pharmaceutical services industry following claims by the federal government that such parties violated the federal false claims act by i improperly marketing and pricing drugs  ii overstating the average wholesale prices of products  iii paying illegal remuneration to induce the purchase of drugs  and or iv failing to accurately report best price under the medicaid program 
for example  in september  caremark rx  inc entered into a million civil settlement of claims under both state and federal false claims statutes that its subsidiary  advancepcs  allegedly solicited and received kickbacks from pharmaceutical manufacturers in the form of excessive administrative fees  over priced services agreements as a reward for favorable formulary treatment  and improper flat fee rebates  and that advancepcs allegedly paid kickbacks to customers and potential customers to induce them to contract with advancepcs 

table of contents in addition  caremark rx  inc agreed to enter into a year corporate integrity agreement with the federal government 
despite these recent settlement agreements  we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such laws 
regulations regarding privacy and confidentiality the federal government and most states regulate the dissemination and use of personally identifiable health information about a patient 
many of our activities involve the receipt  use and disclosure by us of protected health information phi  including disclosure of phi to a patient s health benefit plan 
in addition  we may use de identified data for research and analytical purposes 
in august  hhs issued final regulations under hipaa on standards for electronic transactions and code sets to be used by health plans  healthcare providers  and healthcare clearinghouses in those transactions the transaction standards and code sets  with a compliance date of october  the transaction standards and code sets adopt national  uniform standards that must be used if a healthcare provider or health plan conducts certain electronic transactions with another healthcare provider or health plan 
these regulations also mandate the use of certain code sets in connection with the standard transactions 
we have made the necessary arrangements to provide electronic transactions that are in compliance with these regulations 
in december  hhs issued final regulations under hipaa regarding the privacy of individually identifiable health information the privacy rule 
the privacy rule  which became effective april   imposes extensive requirements on the way in which covered entities and their business associates use and disclose phi 
pbms  in general  are not considered covered entities when performing pbm services 
however  our clients are covered entities  and are required to enter into business associate agreements with vendors  such as pbms  that perform a function or activity for the covered entity that involves the use or disclosure of phi 
the business associate agreements mandated by the privacy rule create a contractual obligation for the pbm to perform its duties for the covered entity in compliance with the privacy rule 
we have entered into business associate agreements as required by our clients 
we are a covered entity with respect to providing service through our mail service and specialty pharmacies  and we have entered into business associate agreements with our vendors or other parties with which we share phi and have provided notice of privacy practices to individuals describing how the relevant pharmacy uses and discloses phi for treatment  payment and healthcare operations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with our business associate and covered entity obligations 
in april  hhs also issued final regulations under hipaa governing the security of electronic phi  with an initial compliance date of april  the security rule 
the security rule imposes general requirements on health care providers  health plans  healthcare clearinghouses  and their business associates relating to the storage  utilization  and transmission of electronic phi 
to date  we believe that we have implemented the necessary administrative  physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality of electronic phi 
sanctions for failing to comply with hipaa standards and requirements include civil sanctions and criminal penalties for certain violations 
in addition to the federal health information privacy regulations described above  most states have enacted healthcare information confidentiality laws which limit the disclosure of health related confidential information 
the privacy rule under hipaa does not preempt state laws regarding health information privacy that are more restrictive than hipaa 
state information confidentiality laws vary widely  some relating to only certain types of information  others to only certain uses  and yet others to only certain types of entities 
the laws generally require entities conducting business in the state to notify consumers when their personal information has been  or is reasonably believed to have been  acquired by an unauthorized person 

table of contents many state laws also require notification to government agencies  such as the state attorney general or consumer protection agencies in the event of a breach or misuse of such data 
due to the severe inconsistency in state healthcare information confidentiality laws  congress is considering enacting a federal security breach law that would potentially create a single national standard  making compliance less burdensome for multi state businesses 
in addition  we have adopted the standards of communication for the pbm industry set by the national council for prescription drug programs  and perform risk assessments  employee training with respect to patient confidentiality  and evaluations of business practices in order to continue to support patient privacy 
to date  no additional privacy legislation has been enacted that materially restricts our ability to provide our services  however  it is possible that new laws or regulations further restricting the dissemination or use of such information could be adopted  or that existing laws and regulations will be interpreted in such a manner as to further restrict our ability to obtain and use information about our plan participants 
such new laws or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
erisa we provide services to a number of clients which are self funded health plans 
these plans are subject to the employee retirement income security act of  erisa  which imposes certain obligations on those deemed fiduciaries of the health plans 
we administer pharmacy benefit plans according to the plan design choices made by the health plan client 
we believe that our activities are sufficiently limited that we do not assume any of the fiduciary responsibilities of the client and thus would not be regulated as a fiduciary under erisa 
in addition  our standard agreement with clients specifically identifies the scope of our services and provides that we are not a fiduciary of the plan 
although courts have declined to extend erisa fiduciary obligations to managed care companies  the united states department of labor the dol which enforces erisa alleged that prior to acquisition by nmhc  pharmaceutical care network pcn  was acting as an erisa fiduciary in providing certain administrative services to its erisa plan clients 
pcn vigorously disagreed with the allegations  but settled the dispute with the dol in may to avoid the costs of protracted litigation 
if  in the future  we are deemed to be a fiduciary  we could potentially be subject to claims regarding breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our provision of services 
several other lawsuits have been filed against other pbms  alleging that the relevant pbm is a fiduciary under erisa and is in breach of its fiduciary obligations 
to date  a court has ruled in one lawsuit that the pbm was not a fiduciary  one lawsuit has settled  and the others remain outstanding 
on may   the united states district court for the southern district of new york accepted a class action settlement proposed by medco health solutions  inc medco in a lawsuit that alleged that medco was a functional fiduciary under erisa and violated its fiduciary obligations by  among other things  failing to make adequate disclosures regarding certain rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers and steering clients toward more expensive pharmaceuticals with higher rebates benefiting medco and its parent company at the time  merck co  inc pursuant to the settlement  medco will pay million into a settlement fund to be distributed to plan participants 
in addition  medco will implement and continue certain business practices aimed at increasing transparency around formulary decisions and therapeutic interchanges 
medco has not admitted  and the settlement does not require medco to admit  any wrongdoing under erisa or otherwise 
on july   private litigants filed suit against caremark rx  inc in the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee alleging that caremark rx  inc was a fiduciary under erisa and violated its erisa fiduciary duties by  among other things  failing to disclose the existence and extent of manufacturer rebates  concealing the spread on pharmacy claims to the detriment of erisa plans and conspiring with pharmaceutical manufacturers to inflate the average wholesale price awp  which is the standard pricing measure used by the pharmaceutical industry and pbms in calculating drug prices 

table of contents in august  caremark rx  inc was dismissed from the action 
caremark rx  inc has filed a motion seeking to transfer venue for the case  which is pending before the court 
on april   the united states district court for the district of new jersey decided a case brought by private litigants against pcs health systems  inc pcs  a pbm 
the plaintiffs alleged that pcs breached its fiduciary duty by taking rebates and kickbacks from drug manufacturers 
the court granted pcs s motion for summary judgment  holding that pcs was not acting as a fiduciary under erisa since it did not have the type of discretionary authority needed to render pcs an erisa fiduciary 
in addition to the cases discussed above  numerous other lawsuits have been filed against various pbms by private litigants  whether a plan participant on behalf of an erisa plan or by the erisa plan client  alleging that the pbms are erisa fiduciaries and that  in such capacity  they allegedly violated erisa fiduciary duties in connection with certain business practices related to their respective contracts with retail pharmacy networks and or pharmaceutical manufacturers 
in addition to its fiduciary provisions  erisa imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal remuneration are made or received 
these provisions of erisa are similar  but not identical  to the healthcare anti kickback statutes discussed elsewhere in this government regulation section  and they do not contain the statutory and regulatory safe harbor exceptions included in other healthcare statutes 
these provisions of erisa are broadly written  and we cannot be certain of the extent to which they could be deemed applicable to the conduct of our business 
effective january  the dol issued claims procedure regulations claims rules that create standards applicable to clients that are regulated under erisa for initial and appeal level decisions  time frames for decision making  and enhanced disclosure rights for claimants 
we have implemented and will continue to implement in the future  changes to our operational processes  as necessary to accommodate our clients compliance needs under the claims rules 
fda regulation the united states food and drug administration the fda generally has authority to regulate drug promotional materials that are disseminated by or on behalf of a pharmaceutical manufacturer 
in january  the fda published a notice and draft guidance for industry regarding its intent to regulate certain drug promotion and therapeutic substitution activities performed by pbms that are controlled  directly or indirectly by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the fda was concerned that pharmaceutical manufacturers might attempt to avoid fda regulation in connection with the promotion of their drugs by utilizing pbms to conduct the marketing activity 
the fda effectively withdrew the draft guidance in the fall of nmhc is not owned or controlled by a pharmaceutical manufacturer  but it does have contractual relationships with them 
although the draft guidance has effectively been withdrawn  there can be no assurance that the fda will not again attempt to assert jurisdiction over certain aspects of the business of pbms in the future  which could materially adversely affect our operations 
consumer protection laws the federal government and most states have consumer protection laws that have been the basis for investigations and multi state settlements relating to financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with drug switching programs 
in addition  most states have enacted consumer protection laws relating to a broad range of managed health care activities  including provider contracting  participant appeals and access to services and supplies 
although we believe we are compliant with consumer protection laws  there can be no assurance that our operations will not be subject to challenge or scrutiny under one or more state laws 

table of contents regulations applicable to health care professionals all states regulate the practice of medicine  nursing  and other licensed health professions 
to our knowledge  no pbm has been found to be engaging in the practice of medicine or nursing by reason of its health management services 
activities deemed by a state s regulatory authority to constitute the practice of medicine  nursing  or any other licensed health profession without the proper license would subject the non compliant party to the penalties provided under such state s laws 
we cannot assure that a regulatory authority in a state in which we engage in pbm services would not assert a contrary position and subject us to sanctions for the unauthorized practice of medicine  nursing  or other licensed health profession 
third party administrator  utilization review laws and preferred provider organizations many states have licensure or registration laws regulating certain types of managed care organizations  including  tpas  companies that provide utilization review services  and preferred provider organizations ppos 
these laws differ from state to state  and their application to pbms is often unclear 
we have registered or are applying to become registered in those states in which we have concluded that such registration or licensure is required 
registration and licensure requirements for pbm activities vary from state to state depending on state agency interpretations 
prior to september  however  we conducted our activities without obtaining any tpa  utilization review or ppo licenses 
we may be subject to cease and desist orders  fines and other penalties in a particular state if a state agency changes its interpretation of licensure requirements or if a state agency determines that we were non compliant prior to the time we were required to obtain a license 
there can be no assurance that such an adverse finding by a state agency would not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
state insurance laws in general  state insurance regulations do not apply to our fee for service prescription drug plans and pbm service contracts  including those in which we assume certain risk under performance guarantees or similar arrangements 
however  state insurance regulations may be applicable if a pbm offers to provide prescription drugs on a capitated basis or otherwise accepts material financial risk in providing pharmacy benefits and may require that the party at risk establish reserves or otherwise demonstrate financial viability 
laws that may apply in such cases include insurance laws and laws governing managed care organizations and limited prepaid health service plans 
in order to participate as a pdp sponsor under the medicare part d  we formed nmhc group solutions 
pursuant to the mma  nmhc group solutions must be licensed as a risk bearing entity under state laws or have obtained a waiver of the licensing requirement from cms 
nmhc group solutions has been approved to operate as a risk bearing entity in it domicile state  delaware  and has filed applications for licensure in the other states and washington dc  and puerto rico 
we expect to operate under a three year wavier granted by cms for these other states and territories since we have demonstrated to cms that we filed substantially complete licensure applications in these jurisdictions 
as a licensed insurance company  nmhc group solutions will become subject to various state insurance regulations that generally require  among other things  maintenance of capital and surplus requirements  review of certain material transactions and the filing of various financial and operational reports 
however  if nmhc group solutions is unable to either acquire all necessary insurance licenses or maintain waivers of such licensing requirements  there may be a materially adverse impact on its ability to participate in the medicare part d as a pdp sponsor 
pursuant to the mma  state insurance licensing  insurance agent broker licensure and solvency laws and regulations are generally applicable to pdps  but the application of other state laws to medicare part d is preempted by medicare part d to the extent that medicare part d regulates the issue 
all states have penalties associated with making false claims to an insurer 
these state laws vary  and violation of them may lead to the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
additionally  several states have laws requiring the prompt payment of claims  which state that health plans and payors must pay claims within certain prescribed time periods or pay specified interest penalties 
these laws vary in regard to scope  requirements and application  and it is not clear the extent to which they may apply to our customers or to us 
also  erisa may preempt the applicability of these laws to certain health plans and payors  but the scope of erisa preemption is unclear 

table of contents mail service pharmacy regulation our mail service and specialty pharmacies  mail service and specialty service  respectively  distribute drugs throughout the united states 
our mail service fulfillment center is located in florida and our specialty pharmacy is located in maine 
mail service and specialty service are each licensed to do business and to deliver controlled substances in their respective state 
some of the states into which mail service and specialty service deliver pharmaceuticals have laws that require out of state mail service pharmacies to register with  or be licensed by  the board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body in such state  in order to mail drugs into that state 
mail service and specialty service have each registered or are in the process of registering in every state that  to their knowledge requires such registration 
some of these states also require out of state mail service pharmacies to comply with certain pharmacy laws and regulations of their states  as well as to employ a pharmacist licensed in the state to which the drugs are shipped 
we believe that mail service and specialty service are currently in substantial compliance with state laws and regulations that apply to their mail service pharmacy operations 
in addition  we believe that all of mail service s and specialty service s applications for state registration or licensure will be submitted prior to the delivery of pharmaceuticals into a particular state  but cannot guarantee that we will obtain all of the required state licenses prior to such date 
mail service dispenses prescription drugs for refills pursuant to orders received through the mail  telephone  fax or the internet from plan participants 
accordingly  mail service will be subject to certain federal and state laws affecting on line pharmacies 
several states have proposed legislation to regulate on line pharmacies  and federal regulation by the fda or other federal agency of on line pharmacies has been proposed 
mail service s pharmacy operations could be materially adversely affected if such legislation is enacted and restricts our ability to offer our services 
other statutes and regulations may affect the operations of the mail service pharmacies 
for example  the federal trade commission requires mail service sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising  to stock a reasonable supply of the products sold  to fill mail service orders within days and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate 
in addition  the usps has statutory authority to restrict the delivery of drugs and medicines through the mail 
however  to date  the usps has not imposed any such restriction that would affect mail service operations 
there are also regulations governing the repacking of drug products  wholesale distribution  dispensing of controlled substances  medical waste disposal and clinical trials 
in addition  federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling  packaging  advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs and the dispensing of controlled substances 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such rules and regulations affecting our mail service and specialty service operations 
antitrust numerous lawsuits have been filed throughout the united states under various state and federal antitrust laws by retail pharmacies against drug manufacturers  wholesalers and major pbms  challenging certain brand drug pricing practices 
an adverse outcome in any of these lawsuits could require defendant drug manufacturers to provide the same types of discounts on pharmaceuticals to retail pharmacies and buying groups as are provided to pbms and managed care entities to the extent that their respective abilities to influence market share are comparable 
this practice  if generally followed in the industry  could increase competition from pharmacy chains and buying groups and reduce or eliminate the availability of certain discounts currently received in connection with our drug purchases 
the loss of such discounts could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  to the extent pbms appear to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market  business arrangements and practices may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anti competitive perspective and possible challenge by state or federal regulators or private parties 

table of contents regulation of pbms the federal government currently does not directly regulate the activities of pbms 
several states  however  have introduced legislation in recent years which  if enacted  would directly regulate the activities of pbms 
to date  a handful of jurisdictions have enacted such statutes  which vary widely in their requirements 
this legislation varies in scope and often contains provisions that i impose certain fiduciary duties upon pbms to customers and plan participants  ii require pbms to remit to customers or their plan participants certain rebates  discounts and other amounts received by pbms related to the sale of drugs  iii regulate product substitution and intervention  and or iv impose broad disclosure obligations upon pbms to customers and their plan participants 
maine and the district of columbia have the most regulations in place for pbms  including extensive disclosure requirements and fiduciary obligations for pbms 
the pharmaceutical care management association pcma  a national trade association representing pbms  filed separate actions in maine and the district of columbia questioning the validity of their statutes on various grounds 
the maine district court granted summary judgment in favor of maine and lifted an injunction obtained by pcma preventing enforcement of the statute 
the first circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court s holding  but clarified that the law applies only to contracts entered into in maine with respect to pbm customers  or covered entities in maine  and that pbms are not erisa fiduciaries  but rather that their relationship with their customers is contractual 
pcma appealed the circuit court decision to the united sate supreme court  but on june   the supreme court denied review 
the district of columbia district court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the district of columbia statute  and the district of columbia appealed the decision to the dc court of appeals 
the dc court of appeals has remanded the case to the district court for reconsideration in light of the first circuit s ruling in the maine case 
north dakota and south dakota have also recently passed legislation regulating pbms  georgia has a law in place primarily relating to the practice of pharmacy  and maryland has pbm specific laws that are less onerous than the maine and district of columbia laws 
widespread enactment of such statutes could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such laws and requirements where required and continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments 
however  to the extent states in which we do business enact bills that regulate the activities of pbms in a comprehensive manner  such bills could materially adversely affect our business 
in addition  statutes have been introduced in several states which purport to declare that a pbm is a fiduciary with respect to its clients 
the fiduciary obligations that such statutes would impose would be similar  but not identical  to the scope of fiduciary obligations under erisa 
to date no such statute has been enacted 
besides state statutes and regulations  we are also subject to state common laws to the extent applied to pbms through judicial interpretation or otherwise 
potential common law claims could involve  for example  breach of fiduciary duty  constructive fraud  fraud or unjust enrichment 
the application of these common laws to pbms and or pbm activities could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  several influential bodies  including the national association of insurance commissioners  the national association of boards of pharmacy  and the national committee on quality assurance  are considering proposals to regulate pbms and certain of their activities  such as formulary and utilization management and downstream risk assumption 
if these or other similar bodies adopt model acts which would regulate the activities of pbms  states may be influenced to incorporate such model acts into their statutes 
if laws directly regulating pbms are passed in states in which we do business  such laws could materially affect our operations 

table of contents legislation and regulation affecting drug prices some states have adopted legislation and regulations requiring that a pharmacy participating in the state medicaid program provide program patients the best price that the pharmacy makes available to any third party plan most favored nation pricing legislation 
such legislation and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our ability to negotiate discounts in the future from network pharmacies and on the reimbursement we receive from medicaid programs 
other states have enacted unitary pricing legislation  which mandates that all wholesale purchasers of drugs within the state be given access to the same discounts and incentives 
a number of states have also recently introduced legislation seeking to control drug prices through various statutory limits  rebates or discounts extending to one or more categories of the state s population 
this legislation  if enacted  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to negotiate discounts on the purchase of prescription drugs from our network pharmacies or manufacturers or otherwise discourage the use of the full range of our services by current or future customers 
in addition  some manufacturers may view these laws and policies as a disincentive to provide discounts to private purchasers  such as our customers  which could adversely affect our ability to control plan costs 
several states have introduced bills for broad drug price controls that would extend price controls beyond the medicaid program 
some bills impose a ceiling on drug prices based on the federal supply schedule and require that pharmacies extend this pricing to one or more segments of the state s population  such as to all medicare beneficiaries 
if enacted  these bills could adversely affect our reimbursement rate for prescriptions 
several states have introduced legislation that would require state agencies that purchase prescription drugs to consolidate their purchasing activities under a single contract 
the state of maine has adopted legislation known as the maine rx program  through which the state acts as a bulk purchaser of drugs for its non medicaid population 
a number of states have proposed similar bills supporting use of non profit pbms to leverage their purchase volume for prescription drugs 
to the extent these bills are enacted  they could adversely affect our ability to effectively do business in such states 
the federal and state government have increased their scrutiny on the method used by drug manufacturers in developing pricing information  which in turn is used in setting payments under the medicare and medicaid programs 
one element that is common in the pricing information is awp 
if the method of calculating awp is changed by the government  it could adversely affect our ability to effectively negotiate discounts with pharmaceutical manufacturers  pharmacies and clients 
in addition  it could affect the reimbursement the mail service pharmacy would receive from managed care organizations that contract with government health programs to provide prescription drug benefits 
under the mma  awp no longer serves as the basis for medicare part b drug reimbursement  except for certain vaccines  infusion drugs furnished through durable medical equipment and for blood and blood products other than clotting factors 
rather  with certain exceptions  part b drugs are reimbursed on an average sales price  asp  methodology 
asp means a manufacturer s total dollar sales of a product in the united states to all purchasers excluding certain sales exempted from medicaid best price reporting and nominal sales divided by the total number of such units of such drug or biological products sold by the manufacturer in such quarter 
manufacturers are required to include in asp calculations all volume discounts  prompt pay discounts  cash discounts  free goods that are contingent on any purchase requirement  chargebacks  and rebates other than medicaid rebates 
the asp methodology may cause some drug manufacturers to reduce the levels of discounts or rebates available to pbms or their clients with respect to medicare part b drugs 
since drugs that are reimbursed on an asp reimbursement system by medicare do not represent a significant portion of our business  we do not believe that asp reimbursement for such drugs will have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the extent to which asp will be used in pricing outside the medicare part b context or changes to how awp is determined and reported to state and federal programs could alter the calculation of drug prices for federal and or state programs 
we are unable to predict whether any such changes will be adopted  and whether such changes would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents further  the federal medicaid rebate program requires participating drug manufacturers to provide rebates on all drugs purchased by state medicaid programs 
manufacturers of brand name products must provide a rebate equivalent to the greater of a of the average manufacturer price amp paid by wholesalers for products distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade and b the difference between amp and the best price available to essentially any customer other than the medicaid program  with certain exceptions 
some drug manufacturers may see these policies as a disincentive to offering rebates or discounts to private purchasers  including the clients that we represent 
in addition  certain state medicaid programs only allow for reimbursement to pharmacies residing in the state or in a border state 
while we believe that we can service our current medicaid customers through our existing pharmacies  there can be no assurance that additional states will not enact in state dispensing requirements for their medicaid programs 
congress has introduced new legislation to permit reimportation of approved drugs  originally manufactured in the united states  back into the united states from other countries where the drugs were sold at a lower price 
however  the fda must certify to congress that this program will not pose any additional risk to the public s health and safety and that it will result in a significant cost reduction 
this section of the mma was to be effective only if the fda gave its certification  and the fda has refused to provide such a certification when requested to do so in the past 
we have no assurance that the fda will not change its position and permit the importation of drugs from canada in the future or that new legislation or regulations will not permit the importation of drugs from the european union or other countries in the future 
whether and how such a policy will be implemented is unclear 
the ultimate impact of such legislation on our business is not known 
in addition  several states have recently passed laws and regulations facilitating and encouraging the importation of drugs into the united states 
at this point  we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the federal and state laws on our business 
legislation affecting plan design some states have enacted legislation that regulates various aspects of managed care plans  including provisions relating to pharmacy benefits 
for example  some states have adopted freedom of choice legislation  which provides that participants of a plan may not be required to use network providers  but must instead be provided with benefits even if they choose to use non network providers  or provide that a plan participant may sue his or her health plan if care is denied 
certain states have introduced or enacted legislation regarding plan design mandates  including legislation that prohibits or restricts therapeutic drug substitution  requires coverage of all drugs approved by the fda or prohibits denial of coverage for non fda approved uses 
other states mandate coverage of certain benefits or conditions 
in addition some states have enacted legislation purporting to prohibit hmos and other health plans from requiring or offering participants financial incentives for use of mail service pharmacies 
to date  there have been no formal administrative or judicial efforts to enforce any such laws 
although such legislation does not generally apply to us  it may apply to certain of our customers  hmos and health insurers 
if such legislation were to be enacted on a broad scope  it could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable by our customers through pharmacy benefit management 
additionally  in late  the equal employment opportunity commission issued a decision holding that two erisa plans discriminated in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of by failing to cover oral contraceptives when other preventive medications were covered 
as with legislation imposing plan design mandates  this decision may apply to certain of our customers and could have the effect of limiting the economic benefits achievable through pharmacy benefit management if it is applied broadly 

table of contents network access limitations a majority of states have adopted legislation restricting the ability of health plan clients to limit participation in their pharmacy provider network or to remove a provider from the network 
these laws may require us or our clients to accept for participation in the network any retail pharmacy willing to meet the applicable plan s price and other terms  and may restrict our ability and our clients ability to remove a pharmacy from the network without certain due process protections 
in addition  the mma contains an any willing provider requirement for pharmacy participation in the medicare drug benefit  which provides that a medicare part d pdp must  under certain circumstances  allow participation by any pharmacy that is willing to meet the terms and conditions for participation that the pdp has established 
to date  these statutes have not had a significant impact on our business because for most of our customers  we administer large networks of retail pharmacies and will admit any licensed pharmacy that meets the network s terms  conditions and credentialing criteria 
formulary restrictions many states have also begun to enact laws that regulate the development and use of formularies by insurers  hmos and other third party payors 
these laws have included requirements on the development  review and updating of formularies  the role and composition of pharmacy and therapeutics committees  the disclosure of formulary information to health plan participants and a process for allowing participants to obtain non preferred drugs without additional cost sharing where they are medically necessary and the formulary drugs are determined to be inappropriate 
additionally  the national association of insurance commissioners is developing a model drug formulary statute  known as the health carrier prescription benefit management model act  that  if widely enacted  may eventually provide more uniformity for health plans and pbms 
among other things  the model act would address the disclosure of formulary information to health plan participants  participants access to non preferred drugs  and the appeals process available to participants when coverage of a non preferred drug is denied by the health plan or pbm 
increasing regulation of formularies by states could significantly affect our ability to develop and administer formularies on behalf of our clients 
industry standards for pbms the national committee on quality assurance  the american accreditation health care commission  known as urac  the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations and other quasi regulatory and accrediting bodies have developed standards relating to services performed by pbms  including mail service  formulary and drug utilization management 
these bodies do not have the force of law  but pbms and many clients for pbm services seek certification from them 
in addition  they may influence the federal government or states to adopt requirements or model acts that they promulgate  for example  the federal government and some states incorporate accreditation standards of these bodies  as well as the standards of the national association of insurance commissioners and the national association of boards of pharmacy  into their drug utilization review regulation 
future initiatives of these bodies are uncertain  and resulting standards or legislation could impose restrictions on us or our clients in a way that could significantly impact our business 
deficit reduction act of the deficit reduction act of the dra was enacted into law on february  the dra significantly changes the medicaid system a state and federally funded program with respect to prescription drugs by revising the methodology used to determine federal upper payment limits the maximum amount a state can reimburse for generic drugs under medicaid  permitting stronger cost sharing requirements applicable to medicaid prescription drugs  and containing provisions intended to reduce fraud  waste and abuse in the medicaid program 
the dra s fraud  waste and abuse provisions encourages states to enact their own false claims acts  mirrored on the federal false claims act  described above  and appropriate federal funding to increase scrutiny on the medicaid program 
the fraud  waste and abuse provisions also include a provision intended to strengthen medicaid s status as payer of last resort relative to private health insurance by specifying that pbms and self insured plans may be liable third 
table of contents parties 
although we do not contract directly with any state medicaid programs  the provisions in the dra have the potential to impact the pbm industry by means of increased prosecutorial and private litigant scrutiny on the pharmaceutical industry in general  which may include pbms 
additionally  the third party recovery provisions in the dra may lead to greater financial recoveries from third party pbms in cases where medicaid was not properly a primary payor on a drug claim  even where a pbm is not financially at risk 
future legislation we cannot accurately predict what additional federal or state legislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future relating to our business or the health care industry in general  or the effect any such legislation or regulation may have on it 
there can be no assurance that the federal or state governments will not impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or profitability

risk factors affecting our business we rely on third parties for our point of sale information system and transaction processing system  and any disruption in these services could materially disrupt our business and results of operations 
our operations utilize an electronic network connecting approximately  retail pharmacies to process third party claims 
this system is provided by a third party adjudication vendor 
because claims are adjudicated in real time  systems availability and reliability are key to meeting customers service expectations 
any interruption in real time service  either through systems availability or telecommunications disruptions can significantly damage the quality of service we provide 
our pbm services also depend on third party proprietary software to perform automated transaction processing 
there can be no assurance that our business and results of operations will not be materially harmed by service interruptions or software performance problems 
we are in the process of transitioning to new software provided by a third party adjudication vendor and any severe interruption during the transition could materially disrupt our business and results of operations 
all new clients joining us will utilize our new software  and we intend to migrate existing clients to this new software 
it is possible that we may experience service interruptions in connection with the introduction of the new software  which may cause affected clients to become dissatisfied with us and seek services elsewhere 
we face intense competition in the pharmacy benefit management industry 
we and other pbm companies compete primarily on the basis of price  service  reporting capabilities and clinical services 
the pbm industry is very competitive and dominated by  in most cases  a few large  profitable and well established companies with significantly greater financial and marketing resources  purchasing power and other competitive advantages 
based on published reports  a limited number of national companies  including pbm companies such as medco health solutions inc  express scripts inc and caremark rx  inc 
have an aggregate market share of approximately of prescription volume 
our competitors also include drug retailers  physician practice management companies  and insurance companies health maintenance organizations 
we may also experience competition from new competitors in the future 
if we do not compete effectively with our competitors  our business and results of operations may suffer 
uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of medicare part d may adversely impact our business and financial results 
the mma created a new  voluntary prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries entitled to medicare benefits under part a or enrolled in medicare part b effective january  we currently participate in the administration of the medicare drug benefit i through the provision of pbm services to our health plan clients and other clients that have qualified as a pdp or a ma pd  and ii by assisting employers  unions and other health plan clients that qualify for the retiree drug subsidy available under medicare part d by collecting and submitting eligibility and or drug cost data to cms for them in order to obtain the subsidy 
our existing pbm business could be adversely affected if our clients decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits altogether to their medicare eligible members 
we are not yet able to assess the impact that medicare part d will have on our clients decisions to continue to offer a prescription drug benefit to their medicare eligible members 

table of contents in addition  as an approved pdp sponsor for  we intend to commence offering medicare part d pharmacy benefits to employer groups on january   subject to entering into a formal agreement with cms during the fourth quarter of this will be the first time we are a direct contractor to the federal government and subject to the rules  regulations and enforcement authority of the federal government over its contractors 
in addition  under regulations established by cms governing participation in the medicare part d program  our subsidiary  nmhc group solutions  must be a risk bearing entity regulated under state insurance laws and must obtain licensure as a domestic insurance company prior to entering into a formal contract with cms 
nmhc group solutions has been approved to operate as a risk bearing entity in its domicile state  delaware  and has filed applications for licensure in the other states and washington dc  and puerto rico 
we are at various stages with these applications in the ancillary states as some states are considering our application  others we have not heard back from and others have been withdrawn for failure to meet certain requirements 
we expect to operate under a three year wavier granted by cms for these other states and territories 
these applications are in various stages  and we can give no assurance that they will be approved 
we have invested substantial amounts of time and resources to our medicare drug benefit program which may impact our business and financial results 
we have currently committed over million in a cash account in connection with cms requirements 
as we become licensed as a risk bearing entity in additional states  we expect to deposit an additional million in the near future to fulfill statutory requirements in various states 
the deposited cash is restricted and will not be available to fund our operations 
in addition  we may not be able to realize any return on our investments in medicare initiatives if the cost and complexity of recent changes by and requirements of cms exceed our expectations or prevent effective program implementation  if the government alters or reduces funding of medicare programs because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayers of the mma or for other reasons  if we fail to become a risk bearing entity prior to the expiration of the cms waivers for the other states and territories  or if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to our clients or individual medicare participants  or if we are not successful in retaining employer groups and their enrollees  or winning contract renewals or new contracts under the mma s competitive bidding process 
there are many uncertainties about the financial and regulatory risks of participating in the medicare prescription drug program  and we can give no assurance that these risks will not be material to our business in future periods 
we rely on a limited number of key clients for a significant portion of our revenues 
the loss of any of these key clients as a result of competitive bidding for contracts  consolidation of clients or otherwise  could adversely affect our business  profitability and growth prospects 
we depend on a limited number of clients for a significant portion of our revenue 
our top ten clients generated approximately  and our top twenty clients generated approximately  of the claims we processed in  although no single client accounted for greater than of our revenues 
our client mvp  which consists of approximately of our gross dollar value of all prescriptions filled for fiscal year ended june   will not be renewing their contract with us which will expire on december  many of our clients put their contracts out for competitive bidding prior to expiration 
competitive bidding requires costly and time consuming efforts on our behalf and  even after we have won such bidding processes  we can incur significant expense in proceedings or litigation contesting the adequacy or fairness of these bidding processes 
we could lose clients if they cancel their agreements with us  if we fail to win a competitive bid at the time of contract renewal  if the financial condition of any of our clients deteriorates or if our clients are acquired by  or acquire  companies with which we do not have contracts 
over the past several years  self funded employers  tpas and other managed care companies have experienced significant consolidation 
consolidations by their very nature reduce the number of clients who may need our services 
a client involved in a merger or acquisition by a company that is not a client of ours may not renew  and in some instances may terminate its contract with us 
our clients have been  and may continue to be  subject to consolidation pressures 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we were to lose one or more of our significant clients 

table of contents we may be liable for damages and other expenses that are not covered by our insurance policies 
various aspects of our business may subject us to litigation and liability for damages  for example  the performance of pbm services and the operation of our mail service and specialty service pharmacies 
a successful product or professional liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage where we are required to pay damages  incur legal costs or face negative publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  our business reputation and our ability to attract and retain clients  network pharmacies and employees 
while we intend to maintain professional and general liability insurance coverage at all times  we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future  that insurance will be available on acceptable terms or that insurance will be adequate to cover any or all potential product or professional liability claims 
specifically  due to the high cost of hurricane related insurance premiums  we may not always be fully insured against these risks  including hurricane related risks in our mail service facility located in miramar  florida 
while it is our goal to be fully insured against natural disasters at all times  we cannot provide assurances that we will be able to obtain coverage at favorable rates that outweigh the risks 
demands by our clients for enhanced service levels or possible loss or unfavorable modification of contracts with our clients could negatively affect our profitability 
as our clients face the continued rapid growth in prescription drug costs  they may demand additional services and enhanced service levels to help mitigate the increase in spending 
we operate in a very competitive pbm environment  and as a result  we may not be able to increase our fees to compensate for these increased services which could negatively affect our profitability 
due to the term of our contracts with clients  if we are unable to extend those contracts or replace any lost clients  our future business and results of operation would be adversely affected 
we currently provide pbm services to thousands of clients 
our contracts with clients generally do not have terms longer than three years and  in some cases  are terminable by the client on relatively short notice 
our larger clients generally seek bids from other pbm providers in advance of the expiration of their contracts 
in addition  we believe the managed care industry is undergoing substantial consolidation  and another party that is not our client could acquire some of our managed care clients 
in such case  the likelihood such client would renew its pbm contract with us could be reduced 
if several of these large clients elect not to extend their relationship with us  and we are not successful in generating sales to replace the lost business  our future business and results of operations would be adversely affected 
our results of operations could suffer if we lose our pharmacy network affiliations or if our specialty pharmacy is excluded from third party pharmacy networks 
our pbm operations are dependent to a significant extent on our ability to obtain discounts on prescription purchases from retail pharmacies that can be utilized by our clients and their participants 
our contracts with retail pharmacies  which are non exclusive  are generally terminable by either party on short notice 
if one or more of our top pharmacy chains elects to terminate its relationship with us or if we are only able to continue our relationship on terms less favorable to us  access to retail pharmacies by our clients and their health plan participants  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
in addition  some large retail pharmacy chains either own or have strategic alliances with pbms or could attempt to acquire or enter into these kinds of relationships in the future 
ownership of  or alliances with  pbms by retail pharmacy chains  particularly large pharmacy chains which control a significant amount of retail pharmacy business  could have material adverse effects on our relationships with those retail pharmacy chains  particularly the discounts they are willing to make available  and on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents specialty service contracts with third party payors  including other pbms  state medicaid  medicare  and insurance companies  to become participants in their networks 
we derive of specialty revenues from other third party payors 
if the third party payor determines to carve out exclusive specialty agreements to a specific specialty vendor  we would no longer have access to the revenues generated through such relationship with such third party payor 
we may be adversely affected by the loss of our relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers or if rebate payments we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers decline 
we receive rebates from numerous pharmaceutical manufacturers based on the use of selected brand name drugs by participants of health plans sponsored by our clients  as well as fees for other programs and services 
we believe our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we lose relationships with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers  rebates decline due to the failure of our health plan clients to meet market share or other thresholds  legal restrictions are imposed on the ability of pharmaceutical manufacturers to offer rebates or purchase our programs or services  or pharmaceutical manufacturers choose not to offer rebates or purchase our programs or services 
over the next few years  as patents expire covering many brand name drugs that currently have substantial market share  generic products will be introduced that may substantially reduce the market share of these brand name drugs 
historically  manufacturers of generic drugs have not offered formulary rebates on their drugs 
our profitability could be adversely affected if the use of newly approved  brand name drugs added to formularies  does not offset any decline in use of brand name drugs whose patents expire or if rebates are not offered by the manufacturers of such newly approved brand name drugs 
we may not be able to effectively manage our growth 
our growth in operations has placed significant demands on our management and other resources  which is likely to continue 
our business has grown rapidly since  in part due to acquisitions  with total annual revenue increasing from million during fiscal to million during fiscal our business strategy is to continue to seek to expand our operations through strategic acquisitions and organic growth through the increased marketing of our services and by expanding the range of services we offer 
we have acquired seven companies in the last six years 
if we are unable to finance our continued growth or manage our future expansion  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our success depends on our ability to retain our senior management and key personnel 
we depend to a significant extent on certain key personnel and senior management  in particular those that have long standing relationships within the pbm industry  which help us to obtain new clients 
accordingly  it is important for us to retain our existing management and to attract  hire and retain additional highly skilled and motivated officers  managers and employees 
therefore  losing the services of one or more members of our senior management or our key employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

table of contents our success depends on our ability to manage potential problems and risks related to future acquisitions 
part of our growth strategy includes making acquisitions  including specialty pharmacy businesses and pbm businesses meeting specific criteria 
our ability to continue to expand successfully through acquisitions depends on many factors  including our ability to identify acquisition prospects and negotiate and close transactions 
even if we complete future acquisitions we could fail to successfully integrate the operations  services and products of an acquired company  there could be inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies among the companies being combined or assimilated which would make it more difficult to implement and harmonize company wide financial  accounting  billing  information technology and other systems  we may experience difficulties maintaining the quality of products and services that acquired companies have historically provided  we would be required to amortize the identifiable intangible assets of an acquired business  which will reduce our net income in the years following its acquisition  and we also would be required to reduce our net income in future years if we were to experience an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets attributable to an acquisition  we could be exposed to unanticipated liabilities of acquired businesses  our management s attention could be diverted from other business concerns  and we could lose key employees or customers of the acquired business 
there are risks associated with integrating and operating newly acquired businesses 
we can give no assurance that we will successfully operate any new business we acquire in the future 
if we are unable to overcome the potential problems and inherent risks related to our recent and future acquisitions  our business  results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
failure of our health plan clients to pay for prescription claims or a delay in payment of those claims could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
our contracts with retail pharmacies that participate in our network generally obligate us to make payments for prescription claims even if we are not reimbursed by our clients 
if our clients delay their reimbursement payments or fail to make payments for prescription claims  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
we could suffer civil and or criminal penalties  lose clients  be required to pay substantial damages or make significant changes to our operations if we fail to comply with complex and rapidly evolving laws and regulations 
during the past several years  the us health care industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation at both the federal and state levels 
numerous state and federal laws and regulations affect our business and operations 
the categories include  but are not necessarily limited to health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations  which prohibit certain types of payments and referrals as well as false claims made in connection with health benefit programs  privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations  including those under hipaa  erisa and related regulations  which regulate many health care plans  potential regulation of the pbm industry by the us food and drug administration  the medicare prescription drug coverage law and cms regulations  consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations  various licensure laws  such as state insurance  managed care and third party administrator licensure laws  pharmacy laws and regulations  antitrust lawsuits challenging pbm pricing practices  state legislation regulating pbms or imposing fiduciary status on pbms  
table of contents drug pricing legislation  including most favored nation pricing and unitary pricing legislation  other medicare and medicaid reimbursement regulations  pending legislation regarding importation of drug products into the united states  legislation imposing benefit plan design restrictions  which limit how our clients can design their drug benefit plans  network pharmacy access laws  including any willing provider and due process legislation  that affect aspects of our pharmacy network contracts  and formulary development and disclosure laws 
these and other regulatory matters are discussed in more detail under business government regulation below 
if we fail to comply with existing or future applicable laws and regulations  we could suffer civil or criminal penalties 
we devote significant operational and managerial resources to comply with these laws and regulations 
although we believe that we are operating our business in substantial compliance with all existing legal requirements material to our business  different interpretations and enforcement policies of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality  or could require us to make significant changes to our operations 
in addition  we cannot predict the impact of future legislation and regulatory changes on our business or assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to operate our business 
government efforts to reduce health care costs and alter health care financing practices could lead to a decreased demand for our services or to reduced rebates from manufacturers 
efforts to control health care costs  including prescription drug costs  are underway at the federal and state government levels 
congress considers proposals to reform the us health care system on an on going basis 
these proposals may increase governmental involvement in health care and pbm services and may otherwise change the way our clients do business 
our clients and prospective clients may react to these proposals and the uncertainty surrounding them by cutting back or delaying the purchase of our pbm services  and manufacturers may react by reducing rebates or reducing supplies of certain products 
these proposals could lead to a decreased demand for our services or to reduced rebates from manufacturers 
in addition  both congress and state legislatures are expected to consider legislation to increase governmental regulation of managed care plans 
some of these initiatives would  among other things  require that health plan participants have greater access to drugs not included on a plan s formulary and give health plan participants the right to sue their health plans for malpractice when they have been denied care 
the scope of the managed care reform proposals under consideration by congress and state legislatures and enacted by states to date vary greatly  and we cannot predict the extent of future legislation 
however  these initiatives could greatly limit our business practices and impair our ability to serve our clients 
failure to develop new products  services and delivery channels may adversely affect our business 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
we develop new products and services from time to time to assist our clients in managing their pharmacy benefit 
if we are unsuccessful in developing innovative products and services  our ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients may suffer 
technology is also an important component of our business  as we continue to utilize new and better channels  such as the internet  to communicate and interact with our clients  participants and business partners 
if our competitors are more successful than us in employing this technology  our ability to attract new clients  retain existing clients and operate efficiently may suffer 

table of contents our leverage and debt service obligations could impede our operations and flexibility 
in january  we negotiated a million credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na jpmorgan credit facility 
as of june   we had no outstanding borrowings under the jpmorgan credit facility 
if and when we borrow funds under the jpmorgan credit facility  we could incur substantial interest expense and future repayment obligations 
our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have important consequences  including the following we will have to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service rather than for our operations  we may from time to time incur additional indebtedness under our jpmorgan credit facility  which is subject to a variable interest rate  making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates  we could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities  such as acquisition opportunities  and react to changes in market or industry conditions  we could be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and we may be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less leverage 
furthermore  our ability to satisfy our obligations  including our debt service requirements  will be dependent upon our future performance 
factors which could affect our future performance include  without limitation  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control and which affect our results of operations  financial position and or cash flow from operations 
our jpmorgan credit facility is secured by our assets 
if we are unable to meet our obligations under the jpmorgan credit facility  these creditors could exercise their rights as secured parties and take possession of our assets 
this would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to bioterrorism and mail tampering  and mail irradiation and other procedures the government may implement to manage these risks  could adversely affect and limit the growth of our mail and specialty service business 
many prescription drugs are delivered directly to our consumers through the mail 
in particular  our mail and specialty service pharmacies send thousands of parcels a week through the united states postal service usps and other couriers 
a number of our contracts also require us to deliver prescriptions within a designated period of time on average following receipt of an order 
we have no control  however  over delays caused by disruptions to the usps or other courier services 
moreover  should the risks related to bioterrorism or mail tampering increase or mail service experience interruptions or significant delays  we may have difficulty satisfying our contractual performance obligations and consumers may lose confidence in our mail and specialty service pharmacies 
additionally  the use of mail irradiation devices  if implemented  could be harmful to pharmaceutical products shipped via the mail 
we understand that this technology is not in general use and the usps has not announced plans to use irradiation screening on prescription medicines 
however  should the federal government implement mail irradiation technology to protect national security due to the risks of bioterrorism via the mail or for other unforeseen reasons  safe and reliable delivery of prescription drugs through the mail may be difficult 
if any of these events occur  we could be forced to temporarily or permanently discontinue our mail and specialty service operations and we would lose an important competitive advantage 

table of contents any disruption of or failure in our automated mail service pharmacy or our data center could significantly reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our clients 
our automated pharmacy and mail service delivery system is located in miramar  florida 
our main data center  located in port washington  new york  provides primary support for all applications and systems required for our business operations  including our claims processing  billing and communications 
these facilities depend on the infrastructure in the areas where they are located and on the uninterrupted operation of our computerized dispensing systems and our electronic data processing systems 
significant disruptions at any of these facilities due to failure of our technology or any other failure or disruption to these systems or to the infrastructure due to fire  electrical outage  natural disaster  acts of terrorism or some other catastrophic event could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to our clients 
although we maintain redundancies and other preventative measures to protect against disruption of these systems  there can be no assurance that redundant systems will in fact operate as intended or with the same effect as the primary systems 
product withdrawal from the market and utilization decreases based off of increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs may cause prescription volumes to decline and our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted 
our net revenues and profitability are based on the dispensing of brand name and generic drugs by our mail service and specialty service pharmacies and retail pharmacies 
withdrawal of these products by the manufacturers or utilization decreases based off of increased safety risk profiles of specific drugs or classes of drugs may cause physicians to cease writing or reduce the numbers of prescriptions written for these drugs 
also  negative press regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may reduce consumer demand for such drugs 
in these cases  if there are no acceptable prescription drug equivalents or alternatives for these prescription drugs  our volumes  net revenues  profitability and cash flows may decline 
the launch of generic pharmaceuticals into the marketplace may impact our financial results 
a great deal of our earned rebates on drugs comes from drugs whose patents will expire over the next several years 
when these patents expire  generic products will be introduced and may substantially reduce the market share of brand name drugs and the rebates manufacturers provide to us for their brand name drugs that are included on the formularies we manage 
we may also be unable to negotiate rebates for new brand name drugs comparable to the rebates we are receiving from brand name drugs with expiring patents 
even though we generally earn higher margins on generic drugs than we earn on brand name drugs  manufacturers of newly introduced generic drugs sometimes benefit from an exclusive marketing period  generally six months  during which time we may be unable to earn these higher margins 
therefore  the typically higher margins we earn on generic drugs and rebates from newly approved  brand name drugs may not offset any decline in rebates for brand name drugs with expired patents

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we provide comprehensive pbm services to plan clients  which include managed care organizations  local governments  unions  corporations and third party health care plan administrators through our network of licensed pharmacies throughout the united states 
our pbm services include electronic point of sale pharmacy claims management  retail pharmacy network management  mail service pharmacy claims management  specialty pharmacy claims management  benefit design consultation  preferred drug management programs  drug review and analysis  consulting services  disease information services  data access  reporting and information analysis  and physician profiling 
we also provide a mail service pharmacy and a specialty pharmacy program for our clients and individual patients 
with the acquisition and significant growth of ascend  we have two reportable segments  pbm and specialty pharmacy 
the pbm segment includes the sale of traditional prescription drugs to our clients and their participants  either through our nationwide network of pharmacies or our mail service pharmacy 
the specialty pharmacy segment includes the sale of higher margin specialty pharmacy products and services for the treatment of chronic and potentially life threatening diseases 
both the pbm and specialty pharmacy segments operate in the united states and its territories 
our revenue primarily consists of sales of prescription drugs  together with any associated administrative fees  to clients and participants  either through our nationwide network of pharmacies  our mail service pharmacy or our specialty pharmacy 
revenue related to the sales of prescription drugs by our nationwide network of pharmacies  our mail service pharmacy or specialty pharmacy is recognized when the claims are adjudicated and the prescription drugs are shipped 
claims are adjudicated at the point of sale using our on line processing system 
specialty pharmacy revenues represent revenues from the sale of primarily biopharmaceutical drugs and are reported at the net amount billed to third party payors  patients and others 

table of contents participant co payments are not recorded as revenue 
under our client contracts  the pharmacy is solely obligated to collect the co payments from the participants 
under client contracts  we do not assume liability for participant co payments in pharmacy transactions 
as such  we do not include participant co payments to pharmacies in revenue or cost of claims 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  excluded from our revenue and cost of claims was approximately   and  respectively  of participant co payments to pharmacies 
if the above amounts were included in our revenue and cost of claims  our operating income  net income  consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows would not have been affected 
we evaluate client contracts to determine whether we act as a principal or as an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through our retail pharmacy network 
we act as a principal in most of our transactions with clients and revenues are recognized at the prescription price ingredient cost plus dispensing fee negotiated with clients  as well as our administrative fees gross reporting 
gross reporting is appropriate because we a have separate contractual relationships with clients and with pharmacies  b are responsible to validate and economically manage a claim through our claims adjudication process  c commit to set prescription prices for the pharmacy  including instructing the pharmacy as to how that price is to be settled co payment requirements  d manage the overall prescription drug relationship with the patients  who are participants of clients plans  and e have credit risk for the price due from the client 
in instances where we merely administer a client s network pharmacy contracts to which we are not a party and under which we do not assume credit risk  we only record our administrative fees as revenue 
for these clients  we earn an administrative fee for collecting payments from the client and remitting the corresponding amount to the pharmacies in the client s network 
in these transactions  we act as a conduit for the client 
as we re not the principal in these transactions  drug ingredient cost is not included in our revenues or in our cost of claims 
as such  there is no impact to our gross profit 
whether revenues are recorded on either a gross or net basis  we record the gross amount billed in accounts receivable and the related claims payable to pharmacies on our balance sheets 
the rebates that we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers are recognized when we are entitled to them in accordance with the terms of our arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers  third party rebate administrators  and our clients  and when the amount of the rebate is determinable 
our revenue is reduced by the amount of rebates remitted to our clients 
we compute the estimated amount of rebates due direct from the drug manufacturers based on the actual claims data and the criteria established in each individual contract 
the drug manufacturers are obligated to reimburse us for earned rebates within a specified period of time 
we reconcile our estimates to amounts received from the manufacturers on a quarterly basis 
certain of our clients are contractually entitled to all or a portion of the rebates we receive 
the manufacturer rebates retained by us  after the clients receive their contractual amounts  have historically had a significant impact on our financial performance 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  the rebates retained by us have approximated  and  respectively  of our total gross profit 
due to the expected continued growth and diversification of our business  we expect rebates to continue to account for a significant  but declining  percentage of our total gross profit 
the pharmacy benefit management industry is intensely competitive  generally resulting in continuous pressure on our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
in recent years  industry consolidation and dramatic growth in managed healthcare have led to increasingly aggressive pricing of pharmacy benefit management services 
given the pressure on all parties to reduce healthcare costs  we expect this competitive environment to continue for the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue our organic growth through increased marketing of our services and by expanding the range of services offered  including home delivery services through mail service  and specialty pharmacy services through our specialty service segment 
we believe these services to be in growing demand within the healthcare industry 
in addition  we intend to continue to pursue an acquisition program to supplement our organic growth by making acquisitions of other specialty pharmacy businesses and pbm businesses meeting specific criteria

under client contracts  we do not assume liability for participant co payments in pharmacy transactions 
as such  we do not include participant co payments to pharmacies in our revenue or our cost of claims 
of the million increase in revenue in fiscal  million was due to the inclusion of revenues from pcn  which we acquired march  in addition  million was due to the inclusion of revenue from inteq  which we acquired april  co payments received from mail service accounted for million of this increase 
another approximately million of the overall gross revenue increase was due to revenue related to new clients or new services offered during fiscal excluding contracts recorded on a net revenue basis 
an additional increase of approximately million was attributable to other existing clients as a result of several factors including higher charges relating to increased cost of pharmaceuticals  new drugs  plan participant growth and an increase in the average number of claims per plan participant 
these increases were partially offset by revenue decreases related to the termination of existing customer contracts throughout the fiscal year  leading to a reduction in revenue of approximately million 
cost of claims increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  pcn accounted for million  of the net increase  while inteq accounted for another million 
new clients and the growth in existing clients accounted for million of the increase 
this increase was partially offset by the loss of clients which reduced cost of claims by million including a million adjustment for previous pharmacy claims 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of claims decreased from to for the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the contracts that we recognized on a net revenue basis decreased our overall costs as a percentage of revenue due to the cost not being recognized on the contracts recorded on the net revenue basis 
in addition  the receipt of an additional million in co payments from mail service resulted in a lower cost of claims as a percent of revenue  since no additional cost of claims are incurred related to these fees 
gross profit increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  in addition to the revenue volume increase described above  pcn accounted for million  or  of the increase 
inteq accounted for another million  or of the increase 
the increase in rebates and administrative 
table of contents fees related to the collection of rebates after accounting for the amount of rebates that are shared with clients  accounted for another million  or 
the balance of the increase relates to the margins on the new business that replaced the lost business and growth in the existing business from additional services provided 
gross profit  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to for the year ended june  and june   respectively 
the contracts that we recognize on a net revenue basis have the effect of improving the gross margin as a percentage of revenue due to the fact that recorded revenue and costs are lower since only the administrative fees related to these contracts are recorded 
the increased activities at mail service and specialty service also led to an increase in gross profit percentage  year over year 
partially offsetting the impact of the net revenue and new activities  we have seen some decline in profit margins due to competitive pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or approximately  from million for the fiscal year ended june  to million for the fiscal year ended june  included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million of a non recurring expense related to the new mountain transaction see liquidity and capital resources and for the fiscal year ended june  was an approximately million charge for the settlement of the midwest health plan lawsuit 
excluding these items  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was million 
approximately million  or  of this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is related to new entities acquired by nmhc during the fiscal year ended june  the major components of the million increase in expenses related to the acquisitions were i salaries and benefits approximately million  ii commissions and fees to outside brokers and sales consultants approximately million  iii depreciation and amortization approximately million  iv rent and related expenses approximately million  v it expenses approximately million  vi professional fees approximately million  and vii other approximately million 
non acquisition related increases included i salaries and benefits from increased headcount million  ii commissions and fees to outside brokers and sales consultants million  iii professional fees much as a result of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act million  iv it expenses million and v other million 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue increased from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  the main reasons for the increase were the impact of recognizing more contracts on a net revenue basis 
for the fiscal year ended june   we earned other income  net  of approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended june   we earned other income  net  of approximately  the primary component of the increase in other income was the realization of a million gain from an insurance claim which represented the excess of the insurance proceeds over the carrying value of the assets covered by the claim 
income before the provision for income taxes increased approximately million  or  from approximately million  for the fiscal year ended june   to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the primary factors leading to this increase were the rises in gross profit and other income  offset by the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses related to the activities of the new entities we acquired 
the effective tax rate decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  the main reason for the decrease was a reduction in our state income taxes 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was approximately million as compared to approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   a increase 
the increase in net income is attributable to the same factors causing the increase in income before income taxes  in addition to the lower effective tax rate 

table of contents in addition  there were three other charges recorded against net income loss available to common stockholders related to the new mountain transaction see liquidity and capital resources 
the first of these charges relates to series a preferred stock cash dividends  which amounted to million for the fiscal year ended june  and approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  the series a preferred stock provides for an initial cash dividend equal to of the investment amount currently million  which decreases to after the fifth anniversary of issuance 
all dividends accrued in each fiscal year were paid by the end of the given fiscal year 
the second charge during the fiscal year ended june  was the million beneficial conversion feature 
this non recurring  non cash charge represents the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the closing of the new mountain transaction and the effective conversion price of  which is limited to the million purchase price for the series a preferred stock 
the third charge is for the accretion of transaction expenses 
certain transaction costs of approximately million related to the new mountain transaction series a preferred stock investment are deducted from the net proceeds and the carrying value of the series a preferred stock 
these transaction costs are accreted to the series a preferred stock carrying value over the ten year life of the series a preferred stock investment 
such accretion amounted to approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  and  for the fiscal year ended june  after deducting these three charges from net income  there remained net income available to common stockholders of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to a net loss available to common stockholders of approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  while net income and net income available to common stockholders excluding the new mountain transaction items are not measures of financial performance under united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  they are provided as information for investors for analysis purposes in evaluating the effect of the new mountain transaction items on net income and net income available to common stockholders

off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are for capital expenditures and operating expenses  including cost of pharmaceuticals  software and hardware upgrades  funding of accounts receivable and inventory in our mail service facility and specialty pharmacy 
also  we require cash to execute our strategy of pursuing acquisitions of specialty pharmacy businesses and pbm businesses meeting specific criteria 
we have acquired seven companies since july utilizing primarily cash 
this has had the effect of increasing our working capital deficits until sufficient profitability is earned to offset these deficits 
as of june   we had a working capital deficit of million as compared to a working capital deficit of million as of june  
table of contents we have invested substantial amounts of time and resources to our medicare drug benefit program 
we have currently committed over million in a cash account in connection with cms requirements 
as we become licensed as a risk bearing entity in additional states  we expect to deposit an additional million in the near future to fulfill statutory requirements in various states 
we may not be able to realize any return on our investments in medicare initiatives if the cost and complexity of recent changes by and requirements of cms exceed our expectations or prevent effective program implementation  if the government alters or reduces funding of medicare programs because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayers of the mma or for other reasons  if we fail to become a risk bearing entity prior to the expiration of the cms waivers for the other states and territories  or if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to our clients or individual medicare participants  or if we are not successful in retaining employer groups and their enrollees  or winning contract renewals or new contracts under the mma s competitive bidding process 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease of million is primarily the result of a million decrease in claims payable to pharmacies  a million decrease in trade and other payables and accrued expenses  a million increase in rebates receivable from manufacturers  and a million increase relating to excess tax benefits from the exercising of stock options in accordance with fasb statement no 
r 
these decreases were partially offset by a million reduction in accounts receivable through improved collection efforts which led to the decrease in claims payable to pharmacies and the decrease in trade and other payables and accrued expenses as noted above 
the decreases are further offset by a reduction in prepaid expenses and other current assets  primarily due to the release of the escrow in connection with the inteq acquisition 
while cash flow from operating and investing activities excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition are not measures of financial performance under gaap  they are provided as information for investors for analysis purposes in evaluating the effect of the pcn acquisition on cash flow from operating and investing activities 
cash flow from operating and investing activities excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition is not meant to be considered a substitute or replacement for cash flow from operating and investing activities as prepared in accordance with gaap 
the reconciliation from cash flow from operating and investing activities to cash flow from operating and investing activities excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition  is as follows for the fiscal year ended june  june  unaudited unaudited net cash provided by operating activities  as reported impact of pcn on cash flow from operations for the period march june  net cash provided by operating activities  excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition net cash used in investing activities  as reported impact of pcn acquisition at march  on cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities  excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition net cash used in provided by financing activities  as reported impact of pcn on cash flow used in provided by financing activities for the period march june  net cash used in provided by financing activities  excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition cash and cash equivalents at end of period  as reported impact of pcn acquisition at march  and pcn s operations for the period march june  cash and cash equivalents at end of period  excluding the impact of the pcn acquisition 
table of contents historically  the timing of our collections of accounts receivable and payments of accounts payable has generally been a net source of cash from operating activities 
this is the result of the terms of trade in place with plan clients on the one hand  and our pharmacy network on the other hand 
these terms generally lead to our payments to participating pharmacies being slower than our corresponding collections from plan clients 
we believe that this situation is not unusual in the pharmacy benefit management industry and expect to operate on similar terms for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that such terms of trade will continue in the future and  if they were to change materially  we could require additional working capital financing 
we have put in place a million revolving credit facility for acquisitions and working capital financing 
however  if such terms of trade were to change materially  and or if we were unable to obtain additional working capital financing  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of million is primarily the result of a million increase in capital expenditures along with million of cash generated from the pcn acquisition in march the pcn cash balance at the closing date  march   was reported as million source of cash  or cash provided by investing activities  calculated by subtracting the million acquisition price and related costs from the million of cash acquired 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions as well as a million decrease in other financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the fiscal year ended june  this increase of million is primarily the result of a million cash inflow  which represented the excess tax benefits from the exercise of employee stock option in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  which we ve adopted july  the increase was further caused by a million increase related to additional proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options  higher pay downs of capital lease obligations of million and the payment of closing costs of million in connection with our line of credit 
ebitda on january   we entered into a five year million cash flow based line of credit with a syndicate of commercial banks led by jpmorgan 
subject to certain conditions  the line of credit may be increased by an aggregate of million 
the line of credit contains various covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain certain financial ratios  which are consolidated net worth  consolidated fixed charge ratio and consolidated debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ratio 
as of june   there was no principal balance outstanding under the line of credit  and we were in compliance with all financial covenants as defined in the credit facility 
the consolidated fixed charge ratio and the consolidated debt to ebitda ratio are evaluated by jpmorgan as a measure of our liquidity and our ability to meet all of our obligations under the credit facility 

table of contents we calculate and use ebitda and ebitda per adjusted prescription as indicators of our ability to generate cash from our reported operating results 
these measurements are used in concert with net income and cash flows from operations  which measure actual cash generated in the period 
in addition  we believe that ebitda and ebitda per adjusted prescription are supplemental measurement tools used by analysts and investors to help evaluate overall operating performance and the ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
ebitda does not represent funds available for our discretionary use and is not intended to represent or to be used as a substitute for net income or cash flows from operations data as measured under gaap 
the items excluded from ebitda but included in the calculation of our reported net income are significant components of our consolidated statements of income  and must be considered in performing a comprehensive assessment of our overall financial performance 
ebitda  and the associated year to year trends  should not be considered in isolation 
our calculation of ebitda may not be consistent with calculations of ebitda used by other companies 
ebitda per adjusted prescription is calculated by dividing ebitda by the adjusted prescription volume for the period 
this measure is used as an indicator of our ebitda performance on a per unit basis  providing insight into the cash generating potential of each prescription 
ebitda per adjusted prescription reflects the level of efficiency in the business and is affected by changes in prescription volumes between retail and mail  as well as the relative representation of brand name  generic and specialty drugs 
net cash provided by operating activities can be reconciled to ebitda  which we believe to be the most directly comparable financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities  as follows in thousands year ended june  net cash provided by operating activities provision for income taxes interest income expense  net net change in assets and liabilities non cash items to reconcile net cash from operations to net income ebitda adjusted prescriptions ebitda per adjusted prescription includes pcn s operating results commencing march   the date of acquisition 
includes inteq s operating results commencing april   the date of acquisition 
includes ascend s operating results commencing july   the date of acquisition 
estimated adjusted prescription volume equals the mail service prescriptions multiplied by  plus retail prescriptions 
these mail service prescriptions are multiplied by to adjust for the fact that they include approximately times the amount of product days supplied compared with retail prescriptions 
contractual obligations we lease offices and warehouse space throughout the united states under various operating leases 
the company also leases pill dispensing and counting devices for use in its mail service pharmacy  as well as computer equipment for use in its various offices 

table of contents in addition  we rent two houses from living in style  llc  an entity partially owned by tery baskin  an executive officer of the company  and bert brodsky  a former chairman of the board  which is used for out of town employees 
we evaluated the cost of hotels for these out of town employees and determined that it was more cost efficient to rent the houses 
the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june  in thousands payments due by period total thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations commitments and contingencies as an approved pdp sponsor for  we intend to commence offering medicare part d pharmacy benefits to employer groups on january   subject to entering into a formal agreement with cms during the fourth quarter of this will be the first time we are a direct contractor to the federal government and subject to the rules  regulations and enforcement authority of the federal government over its contractors 
in addition  under regulations established by cms governing participation in the medicare part d program  our subsidiary  nmhc group solutions  must be a risk bearing entity regulated under state insurance laws and must obtain licensure as a domestic insurance company prior to entering into a formal contract with cms 
nmhc group solutions has been approved to operate as a risk bearing entity in its domicile state  delaware  and has filed applications for licensure in the other states and washington dc  and puerto rico 
we are at various stages with these applications in the ancillary states as some states are considering our application  others we have not heard back from and others have been withdrawn for failure to meet certain requirements 
we expect to operate under a three year wavier granted by cms for these other states and territories 
we have currently committed over million in a cash account in connection with cms requirements 
as we become licensed as a risk bearing entity in additional states  we expect to deposit an additional million in the near future to fulfill statutory requirements in various states 
certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn out provisions 
these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business 
the payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earn out payment to the shareholders of ascend will be made in fiscal since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business  we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 
we entered into an amended and restated preferred stock purchase agreement  dated as of november   with new mountain partners  lp the purchase agreement 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we agreed  subject to various conditions  to issue to new mountain partners a total of  shares of the series a preferred stock at a purchase price of per share  for aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
on march   we completed the sale of the series a preferred stock to new mountain partners and used approximately million of the proceeds of the sale of the series a preferred stock to purchase  pursuant to a tender offer   shares of our outstanding common stock at per share collectively  the new mountain transaction 

table of contents following the completion of the tender offer  new mountain partners owned securities at march  that were initially convertible into approximately of our issued and outstanding common stock and prior to conversion of the series a preferred stock were entitled to cast that number of votes that is equal to approximately of our aggregate voting power 
following the closing of the new mountain transaction  new mountain partners was entitled to and did nominate and elect of the members of our board of directors 
we used the remaining proceeds from the issuance and sale of the series a preferred stock of approximately million  excluding expenses related to the closing of the new mountain transaction  for the inteq acquisition and working capital purposes 
the series a preferred stock provides for an initial annual cash dividend equal to of the investment amount  which decreases to after the fifth anniversary of issuance 
the series a preferred stock is convertible into common stock at a price of per share of common stock  or an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the series a preferred stock may be redeemed at our option subsequent to the fourth anniversary of its issuance  subject to certain conditions 
after the tenth anniversary of the issuance of the series a preferred stock  each holder of shares of series a preferred stock may require us to redeem all or a part of that holder s shares of series a preferred stock 
we anticipate that current cash positions  together with anticipated cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our contemplated cash requirements for at least months 
this is based upon current levels of capital expenditures and anticipated operating results for the next months 
however  it is one of our stated goals to acquire specialty pharmacy businesses and pbm businesses meeting specific criteria 
depending on our evaluation of future acquisitions  additional cash may be required to complete these acquisitions 
in addition  we will require cash to acquire inventory for our mail service and specialty service operations 
in the event that our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  or our cash on hand together with the proceeds from our revolving credit facility prove to be insufficient to fund operations and acquisitions  we could be required to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
there can be no assurance that such financing could be obtained at rates or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
supplemental quarterly financial data the following unaudited financial data has been restated for the quarters ended december  and march  this restatement reflects the correction of two rebate cash receipts from one pharmaceutical manufacturer which resulted in nmhc recognizing additional rebate revenue during the quarter ended december  the impact of this was a misstatement on our income statement and a resulting overstatement of   tax effected of operating income for the quarter ended december  and an understatement of   tax effected of operating income for the quarter ended march  there was no impact on our results of operations or cash flows for the fiscal year ended june  all amounts are in thousands  except per share amounts fiscal year quarters ended june march restated december restated september revenue  as restated cost of claims  as restated gross profit  as restated income before provision for income taxes  as restated net income  as restated net income available to common stockholders  as restated earnings per common share basic  as restated diluted  as restated weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic diluted

use of estimates and critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates and assumptions are based upon a combination of historical information and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we describe below what we believe to be our critical accounting policies 
see also note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition our revenue primarily consists of sales of prescription drugs  together with any associated administrative fees  to clients and participants  either through our nationwide network of pharmacies  our mail service pharmacy or our specialty pharmacy 
we enter into a fee for service per claim charges arrangement with our clients for the payment of administrative fees 
under the fee for service arrangement  we are paid by our clients for our contractually agreed upon rates based upon actual claims adjudicated plus a fixed transaction fee 
revenue related to the sales of prescription drugs by our nationwide network of pharmacies  our mail service pharmacy or specialty pharmacy  is recognized when the claims are adjudicated and the prescription drugs are shipped 
co payment revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended june   and was   and  respectively 
claims are adjudicated at the point of sale using our on line processing system 
to date  our mail service pharmacy primarily fills prescriptions for our plan clients 
revenue from these intercompany sales is eliminated in consolidation 
specialty pharmacy revenues represent revenues from the sale of primarily biopharmaceutical drugs and are reported at the net amount billed to third party payors  patients and others 
approximately of revenues from our specialty pharmacy are from prescriptions filled for our plan clients 
revenue from these intercompany sales is eliminated in consolidation 
the remaining of revenues from our specialty pharmacy are recognized at the point of shipment 
participant co payments are not recorded as revenue 
under our client contracts  the pharmacy is solely obligated to collect the co payments from the participants 
under client contracts  we do not assume liability for participant co payments in pharmacy transactions 
as such  we do not include participant co payments to pharmacies in revenue or cost of claims 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  excluded from our revenue and cost of claims was approximately   and  respectively  of participant co payments to pharmacies 
if the above amounts were included in our revenue and cost of claims  our operating income  net income  consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows would not have been affected 
we evaluate client contracts using the indicators of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting gross revenue as a principal vs 
net as an agent  to determine whether we act as a principal or as an agent in the fulfillment of prescriptions through the retail pharmacy network 
we act as a principal in most of our transactions with clients and revenues are recognized at the prescription price ingredient cost plus dispensing fee negotiated with clients  as well as our administrative fees gross reporting 
gross reporting is appropriate because we a have separate contractual relationships with clients and with pharmacies  b are responsible to validate and economically manage a claim through our claims adjudication process  c commit to set prescription prices for the pharmacy  including instructing the pharmacy as to how that price is to be settled co payment requirements  d manage the overall prescription drug relationship with the patients  who are participants of clients plans  and e have credit risk for the price due from the client 
in instances where we merely administer a client s network pharmacy contracts to which we are not a party and under which we do not assume credit risk  we only records their administrative fees as revenue 
for these clients  we earn an administrative fee for collecting payments from the client and remitting the corresponding amount to the pharmacies in the client s network 
in these transactions  we act as a conduit for the client 
as we are not the principal in these transactions  drug ingredient cost is not included in our revenues or in our cost of claims 
whether revenues are recorded on either a gross or net basis  we record the gross amount billed in accounts receivable and the related claims payable to pharmacies on our balance sheets 
the rebates that we receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers are recognized when we are entitled to them in accordance with the terms of our arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers  third party rebate administrators  and our clients  and when the amount of the rebate is determinable 
our revenue is reduced by the amount of rebates we earned by our clients 

table of contents rebates rebates receivable from pharmaceutical manufacturers are generally billed beginning days from the end of each quarter 
we record the gross rebate receivable and the appropriate payable to the clients based on estimates  which are subject to final settlement 
the estimates are based upon claims submitted and our rebate experience  and are adjusted as additional information becomes available 
upon billing the manufacturer  any differences between our estimate and the actual amount of the rebates receivable is recorded to cost of claims 
rebates are generally paid to clients on a quarterly basis  or as agreed upon with our clients  subsequent to collections from pharmaceutical manufacturers  although there are certain instances where rebates are paid to clients on a more accelerated basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the liability of our clients to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a variety of factors  including the age of the outstanding receivable and the payor s collection history 
when circumstances related to specific collection patterns change  estimates of the recoverability of receivables are adjusted 
property and equipment we state property and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
equipment under capital leases is recorded at the present value of the total minimum lease payments 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method for assets with useful lives ranging from to years or  with respect to equipment under capital leases and leasehold improvements  we amortize them on the straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the assets useful lives 
internal use software we invest heavily in developing software in order to enhance our operations as well as meet the needs of our client 
we apply the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
under this sop  certain costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
costs for general and administrative expenses  overhead  maintenance and training  as well as the cost of software coding that does not add functionality to the existing system  are expensed as incurred 
reductions  if any  in the carrying value of capitalized software development costs to net realizable value are expensed 
intangible assets our intangible assets primarily reflect the value of client relationships that arose in connection with our various business acquisitions 
these intangible assets are recorded at cost and are reviewed for impairment whenever events  such as losses of significant clients or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we continually assess the useful lives of the intangible assets  taking into account historical client turnover experience  including recent losses of clients and expected future losses  to ensure they reflect current circumstances 
goodwill our goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired that has been allocated to goodwill from our various business acquisitions 
we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever events  such as a protracted decline in our stock price or other changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  using a two step fair value based test 
the most recent assessment of goodwill impairment for each of our designated reporting units was performed as of june   and the recorded goodwill was determined not to be impaired 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we have current net deferred tax assets of 
table of contents  and non current net deferred tax liabilities of  the net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization  as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates 
we periodically consider whether or not we should record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
based on our assessment as of june   a valuation allowance is not required against our deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r on july   we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the lattice binomial option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate  post vesting terminations  sub optimal exercise factor and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate  post vesting terminations  sub optimal exercise factor and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we use an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on the historical volatility of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
this approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuation 
for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended june   we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility of based upon the implied volatility at the time of issuance 
with regard to the weighted average option life assumption  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended june   we used a weighted average expected option life assumption ranging from years 
recent issued accounting standards on november   fasb issued fasb staff position sfas r transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to fasb statement no 
r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact of the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of fasb statement no 
r 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas no 
 a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas statement  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principle required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income in the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  sfas no 
does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements when it becomes effective for us in fiscal and are unable  at this time  to quantify the impact  if any  at the time of adoption 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation number  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin establishes a recognition threshold and measurement for income tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a two step evaluation process for tax positions 
the first step is recognition and the second is measurement 
for recognition  an enterprise judgmentally determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
if the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold it is measured and recognized in the financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date of fin may be recognized or  continue to be recognized  upon adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin shall be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
fin will apply to fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact fin will have on our consolidated financial statements when it becomes effective for us in fiscal and are unable  at this time  to quantify the impact  if any  to retained earnings at the time of adoption
