capital investment information concerning our capital expenditures is presented under the caption capital expenditures in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
customers we supply our products primarily to manufacturers in the medical device market 
our customers include all of the large orthopedic device manufacturers  including biomet inc  depuy inc 
a subsidiary of johnson johnson  medtronic sofamor danek  smith nephew plc  stryker corporation  and zimmer holdings  inc we also have established relationships  primarily through our cases product offerings  with leading medical device manufacturers in numerous other medical device market segments  including cardinal health  inc  i and st 
jude medical inc 
we sold to approximately customers  including over new customers  in fiscal we may experience a seasonal impact of the orthopedic industry on revenue in the third quarter because many of our products are used in elective procedures that tend to decline to some degree during the summer months 
sales to our ten largest customers represented and of our revenue in and fiscal  respectively 
our two largest customers accounted for  and of our revenue in fiscal and our three largest customers accounted for  and of our revenue in fiscal our three largest customers in alphabetical order in fiscal were depuy  smith nephew and zimmer and our two largest customers in alphabetical order for fiscal were depuy and zimmer 
no other customer accounted for more than of our revenue in fiscal or fiscal we typically serve several product teams and facilities within each of our largest customers  which mitigates our reliance on any particular customer 
we sell our products to customers domestically and in a number of regions outside the united states 
in addition  our customers often distribute globally products purchased from us in the united states 
set forth below is a summary of revenue by selected geographic locations in our last three fiscal years  based on the location to which we shipped our products percent of revenue by geographic location fiscal year ended united states united kingdom ireland other foreign countries total net revenues sales and marketing our sales and marketing efforts emphasize our design and engineering expertise  internally developed symmetry products  manufacturing capabilities  international distribution network and our ability to provide customers with a comprehensive product offering 
we are increasingly presenting our products and services to customers in a total solutions concept which offers the customer a collaborator for developing complete implant  instrument and case solutions 
we have over sales and marketing personnel worldwide 
in addition to our internal sales efforts  we also sell standard cases through distributors 
our sales personnel are trained in all of our products and services in order to cross sell and identify opportunities outside their immediate area of focus 
we typically serve several product teams and facilities within each customer which diminishes our reliance on any one purchasing decision 
our customer base for cases extends into nearly every segment of the medical device market 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to leverage our existing relationships among this customer base to achieve greater penetration of our customized instrument and implant products 
we intend to increase our marketing of implants  instruments and our total solutions concept to these customers 
our sales personnel are technically trained and are based in close proximity to or located at our largest customers sites 
this physical proximity allows sales personnel to engage quickly with the marketing  design  engineering and purchasing staffs of these orthopedic device manufacturers 
our sales people are empowered to bring in design and engineering product development teams to facilitate a customer s efforts 
our goal is to collaborate with customers early in the development cycle and to continue through production  packaging  delivery and logistics 
manufacturing we have manufacturing facilities in the united states  the united kingdom and france 
we have made significant investments in recent years to modernize our production facilities  improve our production processes and develop superior technical skills that complement our manufacturing capabilities 
these investments have allowed us to continue to improve the quality of our products  increase our manufacturing capacity and improve our efficiency 
our manufacturing processes include forging 
our forging process uses presses to force heated metal between two dies called tooling that contain a precut profile of the desired implant 
the forging process enhances the strength of an implant  which is important for hip stems and other implants that must withstand significant stress 
many customers prefer forging because it provides greater mechanical properties 
we forge gross shaped  near net shaped and net shaped implants 
our know how enables us to produce precision net shaped forgings in large volumes 
casting 
in the casting process  metal is heated until it is liquid and then poured into an implant mold 
casting can be used to produce implants with intricate shapes 
we have developed a technologically advanced  highly automated  casting facility in sheffield  united kingdom 
plastic and metal forming 
our know how and technology facilitates our extensive plastic and metal forming capabilities 
we use thermo form processes to draw uniform plastic cases and specialized equipment to form metal 
our laser controlled metal working machines allow us to punch and shape metal in intricate and complex detail 
machining finishing 
machining is used extensively to enhance our forged  cast and formed products 
we use computer numerically controlled  multi axis and wire electric discharge equipment to cut  bend  punch  polish and otherwise shape or detail metal or plastic 
our finishing processes include polishing  laser etch marking  graphics and other customer specific processes 
the majority of products that we produce are customized to the unique specifications of our customers 
our ability to maintain flexible operations is an important factor in maintaining high levels of productivity 
we primarily use just in time manufacturing and flexible manufacturing cells in our production processes 
just in time manufacturing is a production technique that minimizes work in process inventory and manufacturing cycles 
manufacturing cells are clusters of individual manufacturing operations and work stations grouped in a circular configuration  with the operators placed centrally within the configuration 
cell manufacturing provides flexibility by allowing efficient changes to the number of operations each operator performs  which enhances our ability to maintain product volumes that are consistent with our customers requirements and reduce our level of inventory 
we use raw materials  including titanium  cobalt chrome  stainless steel and nickel alloys  and various other components in the manufacture of our products 
although we generally believe these materials are readily available from multiple sources  from time to time we rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor 
for example  we obtain patented plastic  which is designed to withstand intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations  from a single supplier for use in our instrument handles and plastic cases 
quality assurance we maintain a comprehensive quality assurance and quality control program  which includes the control and documentation of all material specifications  operating procedures  equipment maintenance and quality control methods 
our quality systems are based upon fda requirements and the iso standards for medical device manufacturers 
we believe that all of our facilities are currently in substantial compliance with regulations applicable to them 
for example  in the united states and united kingdom these regulations include the current good manufacturing practice regulations and other quality system regulations imposed by the fda 
our sheffield  united kingdom facility and our united states based facilities are registered with and audited by the fda 
our line of polyvac standard case received fda k clearance  which can reduce our customers burden in obtaining fda approval 
our facilities have obtained numerous industry specific quality and regulatory assurance certifications 
competition our customers  to varying degrees  are capable of internally developing and producing the products we provide 
while we believe that our comprehensive services and core production competencies allow medical device companies to reduce costs and shorten time to market  one or more of our customers may seek to expand their development and manufacturing operations which may reduce their reliance on independent suppliers such as ours 
we also compete with independent suppliers of implants  instruments and cases to medical device companies 
the majority of these suppliers is privately owned and produces some  but not all  of the products required in orthopedic implant systems 
we believe that we are the only independent supplier to offer a complete implant  instrument and case solution to orthopedic device manufacturers 
we compete with other independent suppliers primarily on the basis of development capability  breadth of product offering  manufacturing quality  cost and service 
we believe that we are the largest independent supplier of implants  instruments and cases to orthopedic device manufacturers 
however  other independent suppliers may consolidate and some of our current and future competitors  either alone or in conjunction with their respective parent corporate groups  may have financial resources and research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing capabilities and brand recognition that are greater than ours 
intellectual property we believe our patents are valuable  however  our knowledge  experience  proprietary and trade secret information  manufacturing processes  product design and development staff and sales staff have been equally or more important in maintaining our competitive position 
we seek to protect our non patented know how  trade secrets  processes and other proprietary confidential information principally through confidentiality  non compete and invention assignment agreements 
we currently own us and foreign patents related to our cases and instruments 
these patents expire at various times beginning in and ending in we also have us and foreign patent applications at various stages of approval 
our policy is to aggressively protect technology  inventions and improvements that we consider important through the use of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets in the united states and significant foreign markets 
while we do not believe that any of our products infringe any valid claims of patents or other proprietary rights held by third parties  we cannot provide complete assurance that we do not infringe any patents or other proprietary rights held by third parties 
if our products were found to infringe any proprietary right of a third party  we could be required to pay significant damages or license fees to the third party or cease production  marketing and distribution of those products 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information we own and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
we cannot provide complete assurance that our existing or future patents  if any  will afford adequate protection  that any existing patent applications will result in issued patents  that our patents will not be circumvented  invalidated  or held unenforceable  that our proprietary information will not become known to  or be independently developed by  our competitors  or that the validity or enforceability of any patents or other intellectual property owned by or licensed to us will be upheld if challenged by others in litigation 
due to these and other risks  we do not rely solely on our patents and other intellectual property to maintain our competitive position 
although intellectual property is important to our business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset  we do not believe that any single patent  trade secret  trademark or copyright  or group of patents  trade secrets  trademarks or copyrights is critical to the success of our business 
employees as of january   we had  employees 
our employees are not represented by any unions 
from time to time in the past  however  some of our employees have attempted to unionize at two of our facilities 
we believe that we have a good relationship with our employees

item a 
risk factors our profitability is subject to risks described under this section on risk factors described below 
although the following are not necessarily the only ones facing our company  our business  financial condition or results of operations they could be maternally adversely affected by many of the following risks 
risks related to our business we depend heavily on sales to our significant customers  and our business could be adversely affected if any of them reduced or terminated purchases from us 
a limited number of large orthopedic device manufacturers  all of whom are our customers  control the predominate share of the orthopedic device market 
we depend heavily on revenue from these large companies 
revenue from our ten largest customers represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year and of our revenue in fiscal year our two largest customers accounted for approximately and of our revenue in the fiscal year and our three largest customers accounted for  and of our revenue in fiscal we expect that we will continue to depend on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of our revenue 
in addition  our customer base could become more concentrated if  among other things  there is further consolidation among orthopedic device manufacturers 
if a significant customer reduces or delays orders from us  terminates its relationship with us or fails to pay its obligations to us  our revenues could decrease significantly 
if we are unable to continue to improve our current products and develop new products  we may experience a decrease in demand for our products or our products could become obsolete  and our business would be adversely affected 
we sell our products to customers in markets that are characterized by technological change  product innovation and evolving industry standards 
we are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs  both in collaboration with our customers and independently 
our customers may engage in additional in house development and manufacturing  and we may be unable to compete effectively with our independent competitors  unless we can continue to develop and assist our customers in developing innovative products 
our competitors product development capabilities could become more effective than ours  and their new products may get to market before our products  may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete 
if one or more of these events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 
we face competition from our customers in house capabilities  established independent suppliers and potential new market entrants  and if we lose customers it could have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results 
our customers have varying degrees of development and manufacturing capabilities  and one or more of them may seek to expand their in house capabilities in the future  including adding capacity in existing sites or expanding into low labor cost areas such as asia 
many of our customers are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do and can commit significant resources to product development and manufacturing 
most of our independent competitors are smaller companies  many of which have close customer relationships and either a low cost structure or highly specialized design or production capabilities 
our independent competitors may consolidate and some of our current and future competitors  either alone or in conjunction with their respective parent corporate groups  may have financial resources and research and development  sales and marketing and manufacturing capabilities or brand recognition that are greater than ours 
in addition  the innovative nature of our markets may attract new entrants to the field 
our products may not be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies  which could result in the loss of customers and  as a result  decreased revenue and operating results 
if product liability lawsuits are brought against us or our customers our business may be harmed 
the manufacture and sale of our healthcare and other products  including our aerospace products  expose us to potential product liability claims and product recalls  including those which may arise from misuse or malfunction of  or design or manufacturing flaws in  our products  or use of our products with components or systems not manufactured by us 
product liability claims or product recalls  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or otherwise require us to pay significant damages  which could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 
we carry product liability insurance but it is limited in scope and amount and may not be adequate to protect us against product liability claims 
we may be unable to maintain this insurance at reasonable costs and on reasonable terms  if at all 
our operating results are subject to significant potential fluctuation and you should not rely on historical results as an indication of our future results 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year in the future due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the timing of significant orders and shipments  including the effects of changes in inventory management practices by our customers  the number  timing and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us  our customers and our competitors  changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors  changes in medical treatment or regulatory practices  restrictions and delays caused by regulatory review of our customers products  recalls of our customers products  availability and cost of raw materials  and general economic factors 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly in the future and period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that our revenue will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period 
any shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities or industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
if we do not retain key individuals and retain and attract skilled manufacturing workers  we may not be able to operate successfully  and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives 
our success depends in part upon the retention of key managerial  sales and technical personnel  particularly skilled manufacturing workers 
we compete for such personnel with other companies and other organizations  many of which are larger and have greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully 
we compete with numerous precision manufacturing companies to attract and retain qualified and highly skilled manufacturing employees 
our warsaw  indiana facilities  in particular  faces significant competition  including from certain of our customers and other companies located in or near warsaw that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we do  for skilled production employees 
if we are not able to retain and attract skilled manufacturing employees  we may be unable to support our anticipated growth  which could adversely affect our profitability 
a significant shift in technologies or methods used in the treatment of damaged or diseased bone and tissue could make our products obsolete or less attractive 
the development of new technologies could reduce demand for our products 
for example  pharmaceutical advances could result in non surgical treatments gaining more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to orthopedic implants 
the emergence of successful new biological tissue based or synthetic materials to regenerate damaged or diseased bone and to repair damaged tissue could increasingly minimize or delay the need for implant surgery and provide other biological alternatives to orthopedic implants 
new surgical procedures could diminish demand for our instruments 
a significant shift in technologies or methods used in the treatment of damaged or diseased bone and tissue could adversely affect demand for our products 
we depend on third party suppliers  and in some cases a single third party supplier  for key components and raw materials used in our manufacturing processes and the loss of these sources could harm our business 
we use titanium  cobalt chrome  stainless steel and nickel alloys  and various other raw materials in our products 
although we generally believe these materials are readily available from multiple sources  from time to time we rely on a limited number of suppliers and in some cases on a single source vendor 
for example  we obtain patented radel r plastic  which is designed to withstand intense heat produced during frequent sterilizations  for use in our instrument handles and plastic cases from a single supplier 
any supply interruption in a limited or sole sourced component or raw material could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply  if any  could be found 
we may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms if at all 
this could interrupt our business or reduce the quality of our products 
if we are unable to manage changes in our business and our anticipated growth  our business could be harmed 
our acquisition of mettis on june  significantly increased the size and scope of our operations 
our business has continued to grow at a fast pace since the acquisition  and we believe we will continue to grow at a significant rate 
rapid growth of our business may place a strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and systems 
to execute our anticipated growth successfully  we must attract and retain qualified personnel and manage and train them effectively 
any failure by us to expand and train our work force or increase production capacity or otherwise manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business strategy 
our growth may be impaired if we are unable to meet the demands of our customers  which could result in our customers turning to alternative suppliers 
our current or future levels of indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business  finance acquisitions and pursue new business strategies 
as of december   our total indebtedness  including short term debt  long term debt and capital lease obligations  was million 
as of december   we had an additional million of borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
although covenants under our senior credit facility limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  in the future we may incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  business opportunities  capital expenditures or other capital requirements 
our indebtedness could make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic conditions  make it more difficult to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  require us to dedicate or reserve a large portion of our cash flow from operations for making payments on our indebtedness  which would prevent us from using it for other purposes  make us susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates that affect the cost of our borrowings to the extent that our variable rate debt is not covered by interest rate derivative agreements  and make it more difficult to pursue strategic acquisitions  alliances and collaborations 
our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business  regulatory and other factors 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
we believe that  based upon current levels of operations  we will be able to meet our debt service obligations when due 
significant assumptions underlie this belief  including  among others  that we will continue to be successful in implementing our business strategy and that there will be no material adverse developments in our business  liquidity or capital requirements 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness and to meet our other obligations and commitments  we may be required to refinance our debt or to dispose of assets to obtain funds for such purpose 
we cannot assure you that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  if at all  or would be permitted by the terms of our debt instruments 
to the extent we incur additional indebtedness or other obligations in the future  the risks associated with our indebtedness described above  including our possible inability to service our debt  would increase 
our senior credit facility contains restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt  make acquisitions and make other investments 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions to stockholders or other payments unless we satisfy certain financial tests and comply with various financial ratios 
if we do not satisfy these tests or comply with these ratios  our creditors could declare a default under our debt instruments  and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 
our ability to comply with the provisions of our senior credit facility may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control 
our senior credit facility also contains covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness  acquire other businesses and make capital expenditures  and impose various other restrictions 
these covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
we may be unable to comply with the forgoing financial ratios or covenants and  if we fail to do so  we may be unable to obtain waivers from our lenders 
our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future 
our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future through debt or equity offerings 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including revenue generated by sales of our products  expenses incurred in manufacturing and selling our products  costs of developing new products or technologies  costs associated with capital expenditures  costs associated with our expansion  costs associated with regulatory compliance  including maintaining compliance with the quality system regulations imposed by the fda  and the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
as a result of these factors  we may need to raise additional funds  and these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
furthermore  if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds  our existing stockholders may experience dilution  and the new equity or convertible debt securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  execute our business strategy  take advantage of future opportunities  or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements 
we may not realize all of the sales expected from new product development programs 
we incur substantial expenses in developing and testing new products and related devices 
the realization of additional revenue from new product development efforts is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties  including  directly or indirectly  end user acceptance of the product  reimbursement approval of third party payors such as medicaid  medicare and private insurers and  in some cases  fda or comparable foreign regulatory approval of the product 
in addition  our customers typically have no contractual requirement to purchase from us the products that we develop for their medical devices  and they could seek to have another supplier or in house facilities manufacture products that we have developed for their medical devices 
we also incur costs and make capital expenditures for new product development and production based upon certain estimates of production volumes for our existing and anticipated products 
if the actual demand for our products is less than planned  our revenue and net income may decline 
our earnings could decline if we write off goodwill or intangible assets created as a result of our various acquisitions 
as a result of acquisitions we have accumulated a substantial amount of goodwill  amounting to million as of december   or approximately of our total assets as of such date 
goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized but rather are tested for impairment by us annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances develop that would likely result in impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal or business climate  an adverse regulatory action or unanticipated competition 
we completed annual impairment tests as of october and and concluded at those dates that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets existed 
during  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we recognized impairment of approximately million  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our statement of operations 
in the future  we could recognize impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets  and that impairment could result in a charge to our results of operation and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property and property rights  or are subject to intellectual property claims by third parties  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyrights  know how  trademarks  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our technologies and products 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken or will take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that they will deter infringement  misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation could result in substantial expenses and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as us laws  or at all 
we may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
if our trade secrets become known  we may lose our competitive advantages 
we seek to protect our trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology  in part  with confidentiality agreements with our employees  independent distributors and customers 
we cannot assure you  however  that these agreements will not be breached  we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors 
we hold licenses with third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing  marketing and selling these products  which could harm our business 
in addition  third parties may claim that we are infringing  misappropriating or violating their intellectual property rights 
we could be found to infringe those intellectual property rights  which could affect our ability to manufacture any affected product 
in addition  any protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could drain our financial resources  divert the time and effort of our management and cause customers to delay or limit their purchases of the affected product until resolution of the litigation 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not successful  could result in substantial costs and could harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which could adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign or  in the case of trademark claims  rename our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may not be possible and could be costly and time consuming if it is possible to do so 
efforts to acquire other companies or product lines may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations  and if we complete an acquisition  we may incur or assume additional liabilities or experience integration problems 
we may seek to acquire businesses or product lines for various reasons  including to provide new product manufacturing and service capabilities  add new customers  increase penetration with existing customers or expand into new geographic markets 
our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financings 
these efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
if we complete acquisitions  we may also experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these businesses  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies throughout our acquired companies  or adverse customer reaction to the business combination 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquisition expenses and acquired assets 
we are subject to risks associated with our foreign operations 
we have significant international operations  specifically in the united kingdom and france 
certain risks are inherent in international operations  including difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states  tax rates in certain foreign countries that may exceed those in the united states and foreign earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country  general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate or where end users of orthopedic devices reside may have an adverse effect on our operations  difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries  difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights  and required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks 
we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our business as a whole 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenue and financial results 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than us dollars 
currency exchange rates are subject to fluctuation due to  among other things  changes in local  regional or global economic conditions  the imposition of currency exchange restrictions and unexpected changes in regulatory or taxation environments 
to the extent that we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs incurred in the same currency  exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
during fiscal year and  we benefited from foreign exchange rates  in particular because of the weakening us dollar versus both the pound sterling and the euro  the primary currencies to which we are exposed 
the us dollar has recently strengthened against these currencies and caused an unfavorable impact to operations in fiscal we cannot assure you that exchange rates will not impact us favorably or unfavorably in the future 
in addition  as of december   we did not hold or issue foreign exchange options or forward contracts to mitigate this risk  however  we may enter into such agreements in the future 
any change in the exchange rates of currencies of jurisdictions into which we sell products or incur expenses could result in a decrease in our revenue or operating income 
we may be adversely affected as a result of the long lead times required for sales of certain new products 
we often compete for business at the beginning of the development of new medical devices or upon customer redesign of existing medical devices 
our customers generally must obtain clearance or approval from the fda before commercially distributing their products 
unless exempt  a new medical device must be approved for commercial distribution in the united states by the fda through the k pre market notification process or  in some cases  through the more burdensome pre market approval  or pma  process 
it generally takes three to six months from the date of submission to the fda to obtain k clearance and one to three years from the date of submission to the fda to obtain approval through the pma process  but in each case may take significantly longer 
this results in long lead times for some of our customers new products  which may make it difficult in the short term for us to obtain sales of new products to replace any unexpected decline in sales of existing products 
we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 
currently  none of our employees are unionized 
however  from time to time some of our employees have attempted to unionize at two of our facilities 
in addition  some of our orthopedic device customers have unionized work forces 
while we have not experienced any adverse effects from work stoppages or low downs at our customers facilities  work stoppages or slow downs experienced by us  our suppliers or our customers or their suppliers could result in slow downs or closures of facilities where our products are made or used 
we cannot assure you that we will not encounter strikes  further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes one or more of our manufacturing facilities  we may be unable to manufacture certain products for a substantial amount of time and our revenue could decline 
we have thirteen manufacturing facilities  which are located in the united states  the united kingdom and france 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment and personnel know how that we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event that one of our facilities was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to attempt to shift production to our other manufacturing facilities or rely on third party manufacturers  and our other facilities or a third party manufacturer may not have the capability to effectively supply the affected products 
although we have insurance for damage to our property and the interruption of our business  this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
risks related to our industry orthopedic device manufacturers have significant leverage over their independent suppliers and consolidation could increase their leverage  which could result in the loss of customers or force us to reduce our prices 
we compete with many distributors and manufacturers to develop and supply implants  surgical instruments and cases to a limited number of large orthopedic device manufacturers 
as a result  orthopedic device manufacturers have historically had significant leverage over their independent suppliers 
for example  independent suppliers like us are subject to continuing pressure from the major orthopedic device manufacturers to reduce the cost of products and services while maintaining quality levels 
in recent years  the medical device industry has experienced substantial consolidation 
if the medical device industry  and the orthopedic device industry in particular  continues to consolidate  competition to provide products and services to orthopedic device manufacturers may become more intense 
orthopedic device manufacturers may seek to use their market power to negotiate price or other concessions for our products 
if we are forced to reduce prices or if we lose customers because of competition  our revenue and results of operations would suffer 
our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment measures and other industry trends affecting pricing that could result in reduced sales of or prices for our products 
acceptance of our customers products by hospitals  outpatient centers and physicians depend on  among other things  reimbursement approval of third party payors such as medicaid  medicare and private insurers 
the continuing efforts of government  insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to lower reimbursement rates or non reimbursement for medical devices that use our products 
if that were to occur  medical device manufacturers might insist that we lower prices on products related to the affected medical device or they might significantly reduce or eliminate their purchases from us of these related products  which could affect our profitability 
we are aware of several legal developments that could negatively impact prices of orthopedic devices 
at least one major hospital chain is seeking permission from the us office of the inspector general to implement gain sharing initiatives which could  if approved  negatively impact the prices of orthopedic devices because it would enable hospitals to consolidate vendors and share cost savings with doctors 
we are also aware of governmental investigations of some of the largest orthopedic device companies reportedly focusing on consulting and service agreements between these companies and orthopedic surgeons 
if one of these investigations results in a judgment against one of our large customers our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we and our customers are subject to substantial government regulation that is subject to change and could force us to make modifications to how we develop  manufacture and price our products 
the medical device industry is regulated extensively by governmental authorities  principally the fda and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies 
some of our manufacturing processes are required to comply with quality systems regulations  including current good manufacturing practice requirements that cover the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging and shipping of our products 
further  some of our facilities  records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the fda or other agencies 
failure to comply with applicable medical device regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  repairs  replacements  refunds  recalls or seizures of products  total or partial suspensions of production  refusal of the fda or other regulatory agencies to grant future pre market clearances or approvals  withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution 
in addition  orthopedic implants and other medical devices produced by our customers are subject to intensive regulation and potential pre approval requirements by the fda and similar international agencies that govern a wide variety of product activities from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales and distribution 
compliance with these regulations may be time consuming  burdensome and expensive for our customers and  indirectly  for us to the extent that our customers compliance depends on our operations 
these regulations could negatively affect our customers abilities to sell their products  which in turn would adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
this may result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue 
the regulations that we and our customers are subject to are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state levels 
in addition  these regulations may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and  to the extent we sell our products in foreign countries  we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future 
regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations  higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue 
if our customers fail to obtain  or experience significant delays in obtaining  fda clearances or approvals to commercially distribute our future products our ability to sell our products could suffer 
some of our medical devices are subject to rigorous regulatory pre approval by the fda and other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
our customers are typically responsible for obtaining the applicable regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our products 
the process of obtaining this approval  particularly from the fda  can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that our customers will obtain the required approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
the fda  for example  assigns medical devices to one of three classes which determines  among other things  the type and degree of fda approval required to commercially distribute the device in the united states 
we produce class i  ii and iii devices 
class i devices are deemed to present little risk to patients and are generally exempt from fda approval requirements 
class ii devices can generally be commercially distributed only after the device has received k clearance 
the fda will clear marketing of a medical device through the k process if certain design  testing and validation requirements are met and it is demonstrated that the device is substantially equivalent to a device that was legally marketed prior to may   or to another commercially available device subsequently cleared through the k pre market notification process 
this process generally takes three to six months  but may take substantially longer 
before a class iii device can be commercially distributed in the united states  a pre market approval  or pma  must be obtained from the fda 
the pma process can be expensive and uncertain  requires detailed and comprehensive scientific and other data and generally takes between one and three years  but may take significantly longer 
the commercial distribution of any products we develop that require regulatory clearance may be delayed 
in addition  because we cannot assure you that any new products or any product enhancements we develop for commercial distribution in the united states will be exempt from the fda market clearance requirements or subject to the shorter k clearance process  the regulatory approval process for our products or product enhancements may take significantly longer than anticipated by us or our customers 
we may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations 
we are subject to foreign  federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety  including laws regulating air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  and the health and safety of our employees 
we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain operations 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could incur fines  penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
environmental laws tend to become more stringent over time  and we could incur material expenses in the future relating to compliance with future environmental laws 
in addition  we could be held responsible for costs and damages arising from any contamination at our past or present facilities or at third party waste disposal sites 
such costs could be material 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials  and we may incur material liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
risks relating to our common stock our common stock may be volatile and could decline substantially 
there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies operating in the medical device industry  including our company  which has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
price declines in our common stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  our announcements or our competitors announcements regarding new products  significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic investments  loss of any of our key management or technical personnel  conditions affecting orthopedic device manufacturers or the medical device industry generally  product liability lawsuits against us or our customers  clinical trial results with respect or our customers medical devices  changes in our growth rates or our competitors growth rates  developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights  or those of our competitors  fda and international actions with respect to the government regulation of medical devices and third party reimbursement practices  public concern as to the safety of our products  changes in health care policy in the united states and internationally  conditions in the financial markets in general or changes in general economic conditions  our inability to raise additional capital  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  other comparable companies or the medical device industry generally  or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock  sales of our common stock by our executive officers  directors and five percent stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock  and changes in accounting principles 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  litigation has often been brought against that company 
if litigation of this type is brought against us  it could be extremely expensive and divert management s attention and the company s resources 
a large percentage of our voting stock is controlled by one principal stockholder whose interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders 
as of december  the olympus funds beneficially own of our common stock 
as a result of this ownership  the olympus funds have a substantial influence on our affairs and their voting power will constitute a large percentage of any quorum of our stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of our stockholders 
such matters include the election of directors  the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws and approval of mergers or sales of substantially all our assets 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares  which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 
in addition  as of december   three of our seven directors  including the chairman of our board  are representatives of the olympus funds 
the olympus funds may cause corporate actions to be taken even if the interests of the olympus funds conflict with the interests of our other stockholders 
we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of the new york stock exchange rules  and as a result will no longer qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 
we are listed on the new york stock exchange and are therefore subject to the nyse s corporate governance rules 
we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of section a of the nyse s listed company manual 
furthermore  by july   all of our committees must be comprised solely of independent directors and a majority of the directors on our board must be independent 
currently our board consists of seven directors  three of whom are independent 
during the phase in period granted to us by the nyse  our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all nyse corporate governance rules 
if  by july  we do not comply with nyse requirements  we may be subject to enforcement actions by the nyse 
in addition  this change in our board and committee membership may result in a change in corporate strategy and operating philosophies  and may result in deviations from our current growth strategy  and the board s limited history of working together may inhibit its ability to function at current levels of efficiency 
a significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future 
if there are substantial sales of our common stock or the perception that these sales could occur  the price of our common stock could decline 
our current stockholders hold a substantial number of shares of our common stock that they are able to sell in the public market in the near future 
a significant portion of these shares are held by a small number of stockholders 
sales by our current stockholders of a substantial number of shares could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
as of december   olympus funds held approximately million shares of our common stock  including shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants  have rights  subject to some conditions  to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders 
effective february   olympus funds distributed approximately million net shares to investors in their fund 
after this distribution  olympus funds held approximately million shares of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law  our certificate of incorporation and our by laws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors 
these provisions include providing for a classified board of directors with staggered terms  requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by laws  eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
limiting the ability of stockholders to amend  alter or repeal the by laws  and authorizing of the board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and shares of our common stock 
we are also protected by section of the delaware general corporation law  which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who becomes a or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such status unless certain board or stockholder approvals were obtained
