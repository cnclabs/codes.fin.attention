item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal years ended august   august  and august  included in item of this report 
overview as of november   we operated restaurants  of which are traditional cafeterias and two primarily serve seafood 
these establishments are located in close proximity to retail centers  business developments  and residential areas throughout five states 
of the restaurants  are operated on sites owned by us and are on leased premises 
not included in the currently operating units is one leased  traditional cafeteria style restaurant which was closed and the lease terminated  due to storm damage 
reclassification our business plan  as approved in fiscal  called for the closure of over locations 
in accordance with the plan  the entire fiscal activity of the applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
for comparison purposes  prior period results related to these same locations have also been reclassified to discontinued operations 
accounting periods our fiscal year ends on the last wednesday in august 
as such  each fiscal year normally consists of four week periods  or accounting periods  accounting for days in the aggregate 
each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four week periods  while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four week periods 
fiscal was a week year  while fiscal was a week year for us  with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter 
comparability between quarters may be affected by the varying lengths of the quarters  as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant business 
same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service  all of which may have an effect on same store sales 
our same store sales calculation measures the relative performance of a certain group of restaurants 
to qualify for inclusion in this group  a store must have been in operation for consecutive accounting periods 
although management believes this approach leads to more effective year over year comparisons  neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant companies 
same store sales increased   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
same store sales removes the additional week of sales in fiscal and compares sales year over year for periods which include approximately the same calendar dates 
this approach was also applied to same store sales for fiscal quarters  adjusting for the additional week in fiscal fourth quarter the following table shows the same store sales change for comparative historical quarters fiscal fiscal fiscal q q q q q q q q q q q q same store sales hurricane impact hurricane rita impacted a number of our markets during the first quarter of fiscal as we were forced to temporarily close many stores due to mandatory evacuations and subsequent power outages 
we experienced a store closure impact of store days of operations due to hurricane rita 
one unit in port arthur  texas suffered permanent damage and the lease has been terminated 
all other restaurants impacted by the storm suffered minimal damage and were reopened soon after the storm passed 
the store closure impact on our results of operations was offset by increased traffic at certain units and catering events relating to the hurricane relief effort 
results of operations fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal on a same store basis  sales increased approximately million  or 
excluding the additional  or rd  week of sales included in fiscal year  same store sales growth for fiscal was approximately million  or 
food costs increased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to slightly higher commodity prices for seafood and produce  which were partially offset by slightly lower commodity prices for poultry and dairy 
our promotion of combination meals have provided favorable cost structures 
as a percentage of sales  food costs decreased  from in fiscal to in fiscal payroll and related costs decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  these costs decreased  from in fiscal to in fiscal  due to operational focus and lower workers compensation expense  including the effects of reduced actuarial estimates of potential losses resulting from favorable claims experience 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales these costs increased  and were driven by higher utilities costs as well as higher restaurant supply and repair and maintenance costs  while being partially offset by a million insurance recovery associated with a business interruption claim due to hurricane rita  recorded as a reduction to operating expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal subsequent to year end  we collected approximately million related to this claim 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased capital expenditures in fiscal relocation and voluntary severance costs decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal since no costs of this nature were incurred during fiscal during fiscal  we incurred costs of approximately million related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to houston  texas 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  primarily due to increased staffing and share based compensation expenses 
the provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal this change is primarily due to asset impairment and lease settlement costs in fiscal the net loss gain on disposition of property and equipment increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal this change is primarily due to the retirement of obsolete equipment that was identified during our fiscal review of restaurant equipment at all of our restaurants and at our houston service center 
interest expense  net  decreased approximately million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to an million write off of the unamortized portion of the discount associated with convertible subordinated notes upon their conversion to common stock in august  in combination with the elimination of outstanding debt and lower interest rates following the refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness in other income  net  increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the increase in prepaid state sales tax discounts and the write off of expired gift certificates 
the income tax benefit for fiscal primarily represents the recognition of tax benefits for net operating losses not recognized in previous years due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them 
see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
unlike recent fiscal years  when income tax expenses and benefits were not recognized due to unutilized net operating losses and related valuation allowance  our provision for income taxes in future periods will be reflective of the tax effect of the pre tax income losses recognized in those periods once all of our net operating losses are fully utilized 
additionally  the recently enacted texas franchise tax will impact future income tax provisions 
the net loss from discontinued operations decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  principally because we no longer have any deferred financing costs or interest associated with closed stores in fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal approximately million of the increase is attributable to an additional  or rd  week of sales included in fiscal year versus fiscal year which was weeks in length 
excluding the additional week  same store sales growth for fiscal was 
marketing promotions  continued customer appeal of the new combination meals  and improved product and service execution all contributed to our same store sales growth 
all of our sales during fiscal were characterized as same store sales 
in fiscal  seven units were closed and reclassified to discontinued operations 
food costs increased million  or  and were relatively flat as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal higher commodity prices for beef  seafood and fresh produce were slightly offset by lower poultry and dairy prices and the continued rollout of new combination meals with favorable cost structures 
payroll and related costs increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  payroll and related costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of a reduction in workers compensation expense and enhanced productivity due to effective labor deployment 
the reduction in workers compensation expense was due to revised reserve requirements resulting from reductions in recent claims experience 
these reductions in expense were partially offset by greater store management compensation expense 
other operating expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of sales  other operating expenses remained flat 
increased advertising costs associated with our television marketing campaign and increased utility costs due to rising natural gas prices were offset by lower repairs and maintenance and insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was a result of a reduction in the depreciable base of our property and equipment 
relocation and voluntary severance costs related to the relocation of our corporate offices to houston  texas decreased approximately million as the majority of the cost associated with the relocation included voluntary severance costs accrued in fiscal the remaining relocation costs were expensed as incurred in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was driven primarily by professional service costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and consulting fees associated with the implementation of new point of sale and accounting systems 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses remained flat in fiscal compared to fiscal the net gain on disposition of property and equipment decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal this change was primarily due to a reduction in gains recorded on the sale of obsolete equipment 
interest expense  net  increased million  or  primarily due to an million write off of the unamortized portion of the discount associated with the convertible subordinated notes  which were converted to common stock in august this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense due primarily to the continued reduction in outstanding debt under the line of credit 
other income  net  decreased approximately million primarily due to the recognition in fiscal of a gain on a sales and leaseback transaction 
see note  operating leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the provision benefit for income taxes changed by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  we recognized a million tax benefit related to a reduction in the income tax valuation allowance triggered by the establishment of a deferred tax liability for the modification of the beneficial conversion feature on convertible subordinated debt 
additionally  because our loss carryforward more than offset fiscal income from continuing operations  we did not provide for any income tax with respect to this income 
the loss from discontinued operations decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to significant losses and impairments associated with discontinued operations incurred and taken in fiscal related to store closures 
during fiscal  impairments and losses associated with discontinued operations were offset by gains recognized on the sale of related properties 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased by million from the end of fiscal to august   primarily due to cash flows from operations and proceeds from sales of properties  partially offset by debt repayment and capital expenditures

affiliations and related parties affiliations we entered into an affiliate services agreement effective august  with two companies  pappas partners  lp and pappas restaurants  inc the pappas entities  which are restaurant entities owned by christopher j 
pappas and harris j 
pappas  our chief executive officer and chief operating officer  respectively 
that agreement was amended on july  to limit the scope of expenditures therein to professional and consulting services 
additionally  on july   we entered into a master sales agreement with the pappas entities 
through this agreement  we contractually separated the design and fabrication of equipment and furnishings from the affiliate services agreement 
the master sales agreement covers the costs incurred for modifications to existing equipment  as well as custom fabrication  including stainless steel stoves  shelving  rolling carts  and chef tables 
these items are custom designed and built to fit the designated kitchens and are also engineered to give a longer service life than comparably manufactured equipment 
the pricing of equipment  repair  and maintenance is set and evaluated periodically and is considered by management to be primarily at or below market for comparable goods and services 
to assist in periodically monitoring pricing of the transactions associated with the master sales agreement and the affiliate services agreement  the finance and audit committee of our board of directors has periodically used independent valuation consultants 
the affiliate services agreement expired on december as part of the affiliation with the pappas entities  we lease a facility  the houston service center  in which we have installed a centralized restaurant service center to support field operations 
the building at this location has  square feet of warehouse space and  square feet of office space and is leased from the pappas entities at an approximate monthly rate of per square foot 
from this center  our repair and service teams are dispatched to our restaurants when facility or equipment maintenance and servicing are needed 
the facility is also used for repair and storage of new and used equipment 
we paid approximately   and  in fiscal   and  respectively  pursuant to the terms of this lease 
we previously leased from an unrelated third party a location used to house increased equipment inventories due to store closures under our business plan 
we considered it more prudent to lease this location rather than to pursue purchasing a storage facility  given our strategy to focus our capital expenditures on our operating restaurants 
in a separate transaction  the third party property owner sold the location to the pappas entities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  with the pappas entities becoming our landlord for that location effective august  the storage site complements the houston service center with approximately  square feet of warehouse space at an approximate monthly rate of per square foot
