item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for information regarding royalties and milestone payments under these agreements 
glaxo wellcome assignment in january  glaxo wellcome  inc now glaxosmithkline plc assigned all rights to the use of the stable prostacyclin analog now known as remodulin to us 
the patent covering the use of remodulin for pulmonary hypertension does not expire in the united states until october as extended see patent term extensions below and until various dates from september to august in nine other countries 
pharmacia license in december  pharmacia upjohn company now pfizer  inc exclusively licensed certain patents  a patent application and know how for the composition and production of the stable prostacyclin analog now known as remodulin to us 
we filed our own united states patent application for a new synthesis and production method for remodulin in october  and the patent was granted in august two additional patents covering this synthesis and production method were granted in march and august we believe that our method is a substantial improvement over the pharmacia method and we are using our unique synthesis method rather than the licensed pharmacia method for the production of remodulin 
we have also registered two patents and have one pending patent application with respect to additional remodulin synthesis improvements 
altarex medical corp 
agreement in april and august  we entered into license agreements with altarex medical corp 
formally known as altarex corp 
for the exclusive worldwide rights other than certain european and middle eastern countries to certain patents relating to a platform of immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies 
these antibodies are currently in various stages of clinical and preclinical testing 
the lead compound  ovarex mab oregovomab  is in phase iii clinical trials 
the compounds and the method of using the compounds are the subject of a combination of issued patents and pending applications in the united states and around the world 
the issued patents have expiration dates ranging from to subject to extension see patent term extensions below 
additional inventions relating to the compounds may be owned jointly by altarex and us or individually by altarex  depending on the source of the invention 
on december   altarex medical corp 
was acquired by virexx medical corporation in an all stock for stock transaction 
altarex medical now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of virexx 
these transactions have not affected our licensing agreements 
synergy pharmaceuticals  inc in march  we entered into a license agreement with synergy pharmaceuticals  inc synergy to obtain from synergy the exclusive worldwide rights to certain patents relating to novel antiviral compounds known as iminosugars 
the compounds are currently in various stages of preclinical testing or early clinical testing  and are the subject of a combination of issued patents and pending applications in the united states and around the world 
in november  we and synergy amended the exclusive license agreement to include the development of new analogs of the licensed compounds 
as part of this amendment  we agreed to directly assume synergy s role in funding ongoing research being conducted by the university of oxford into analogs of the antiviral compounds being developed by us and synergy 
we received an exclusive license from the university of oxford to all inventions arising from such research and entered into the first such license in november for the lead compound  ut b 
a second exclusive license for different rights is pending 
in march  we and synergy entered into an assignment and assumption agreement and a redemption and termination agreement together referred to as the agreements 
under the agreements  synergy assigned all of its intellectual property rights in the glycobiology antiviral agents to us and exclusively sublicensed to us all of the intellectual property rights that had been licensed to synergy by third parties  the prosecution and maintenance of which are now our responsibility 
synergy also released us from all milestone and royalty obligations that would have become due should a product be successfully developed 
stanford university and new york medical college licenses in  we acquired the exclusive license to patents related to arginine based dietary supplements to enhance the level of naturally occurring nitric oxide in the vascular system from stanford university and new york medical college 
the licenses cover worldwide territories and are valid for the life of the patents ranging from to 
we will own all rights to any new products derived from these licenses 
patent term extensions we believe that some of the patents to which we have rights may be eligible for extensions of up to five years based upon patent term restoration procedures in the united states under the waxman hatch act  and under similar procedures in europe 
in february  we were granted a five year patent term extension by the united states patent and trademark office for a patent covering the method of treating pulmonary hypertension using remodulin 
us patent number  titled method of treating pulmonary hypertension with benzidine prostaglandins  was originally scheduled to expire on october  it will now expire on october  the five year hatch waxman act extension is the maximum extension allowed under usc research development expenditures we are engaged in research and development and have incurred substantial expenses for these activities 
these activities generally include the cost of acquiring or inventing new technologies and products as well as their development 
research and development expenses during  and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations major research and development projects for additional information regarding expenditures related to major research and development projects 
manufacturing and supply we make treprostinil  the active ingredient in remodulin for all routes of administration  in chicago  illinois and are planning to move our laboratories to silver spring  maryland 
baxter healthcare corporation formerly cook imaging corporation formulates remodulin for us 
the agreement with baxter had an initial term which ended in october and was renewed for an additional eighteen months 
the contract is renewable for successive eighteen month terms 
we rely on cardinal health  inc for stability studies on remodulin  formulation of treprostinil for inhalation use and analyses of other products we are developing 
medtronic minimed provides the delivery device used to administer subcutaneous remodulin to patients 
products manufactured by contract manufacturers include ut b  arginine and telemedicine products 
prior to mid  telemedicine products were manufactured by medicomp at its facility in florida 
although we believe that other manufacturers and suppliers could provide similar products  services and materials  there are a limited number of companies which could replace these manufacturers and suppliers 
a change in supplier or manufacturer could cause a delay in the manufacture  distribution and research efforts associated with the respective product or result in increased costs 
for further discussion on this risk  see item a risk factors we have limited experience with manufacturing and depend on third parties  who may not perform  to synthesize and manufacture many of our products 
competition many drug companies engage in research and development to commercialize products to treat cardiovascular  cancer and infectious diseases 
we are aware of four existing treatments already approved in the united states for pulmonary arterial hypertension with which remodulin competes 
they are flolan  an intravenously delivered prostacyclin marketed by glaxosmithkline  plc  tracleer  an oral endothelin antagonist marketed by actelion  ltd  revatio  a pde inhibitor and a new formulation of the very successful drug viagra  marketed by pfizer  and ventavis  an inhaled prostacyclin marketed by cotherix  inc in the united states and by schering ag in europe 
two additional oral endothelin antagonists are being developed 
one is thelin  being developed by encysive pharmaceuticals  inc  and the other is ambrisentan  being developed by myogen  inc in addition  competitors may develop and commercialize other products that compete with our products and may do so more rapidly than us 
for further discussion on this risk  see item a risk factors we are aware of investigational products being developed for the treatment of pah with which our products may have to compete 
tracleer is the first drug in a class of drugs known as endothelin antagonists 
revatio is a phosphodiesterase type pde inhibitor 
these drugs block the endothelin and the pde enzyme  respectively  which results in the dilation of pulmonary blood vessels in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
endothelin antagonists and pde inhibitors may be used in combination with prostacyclins since these drugs provide symptomatic relief in different ways and might complement each other to treat these seriously ill patients 
many companies market or are developing products that will compete with our arginine products in the nutritional supplement market 
however  we are the only company that owns the patent rights to claim the use of the key ingredient  arginine  for maintaining vascular function 
two competitors agreed to pay a royalty to us on their arginine products 
we are pursuing other potential infringers and are currently prosecuting three patent enforcement lawsuits 
holter and event monitoring analysis services and systems are provided by many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors 
we compete with all of these companies for customers  funding  access to licenses  personnel  third party collaborators  product development and commercialization 
almost all of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  product development and marketing  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than we do 
governmental regulation the research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing and distribution of drug products are extensively regulated by government authorities in the united states and in other countries 
drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda in the united states and similar regulatory bodies in other countries 
the steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the united states  which are similar to steps required in most other countries  include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals and formulation studies and the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application for a new drug  clinical studies in healthy volunteers  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  the submission of a new drug application to the fda  and fda review and approval of the new drug application prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  toxicity and formulation  as well as animal studies 
the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application 
a day waiting period after the filing of each investigational new drug application is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans 
at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  the fda may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials until the fda authorizes trials under specified terms 
the investigational new drug application process may be extremely costly and substantially delay development of our products 
moreover  positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials 
clinical trials to support new drug applications are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
during phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess its effects on bodily functions and safety  including side effects associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  then phase iii trials  also called pivotal studies  major studies or advanced clinical trials  are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
after successful completion of the required clinical testing  a new drug application is typically submitted 
the fda may request additional information before accepting a new drug application for filing  in which case the application must be resubmitted with the additional information 
once the submission has been accepted for filing  the fda generally takes ten months to review the application and respond to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification 
the fda may refer the new drug application to an appropriate advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
the fda may also inspect the manufacturing facility before approving a new drug application 
if fda evaluations of the new drug application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter 
an approvable letter will usually contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the new drug application and authorization of commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
the fda also may refuse to approve the new drug application and issue a not approvable letter  outlining the deficiencies in the submission and often requiring additional testing or information 
at the request of an applicant  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug if the drug is intended to treat a rare disease or condition 
a disease or condition is considered rare if it affects fewer than  people in the united states 
if an applicant obtains the first fda marketing approval for a certain orphan drug  the applicant will have a seven year exclusive right to market the drug for the orphan indication 
the fda has approved the orphan designation for remodulin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension  a designation that includes both primary pulmonary hypertension and secondary pulmonary hypertension 
ovarex has received both orphan drug and fast track designations by the fda for the treatment of patients with certain types of stage iii or iv ovarian cancer 
under the food and drug administration modernization act fdama  fast track designations are designed to help accelerate the regulatory approval process for key investigational drugs that meet an unmet medical need 
the designations provide the potential for expedited fda review and accelerated approval 
subcutaneous remodulin was approved by the fda for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise  and intravenous remodulin was approved for those patients not able to tolerate subcutaneous infusion 
if regulatory approval of our other products is granted  such approvals will similarly be limited to certain disease states or conditions 
the manufacturers of approved products and their manufacturing facilities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
in addition  identification of certain side effects or the occurrence of manufacturing problems after a drug is on the market could cause subsequent withdrawal of approval  reformulation of the drug  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials  and changes in labeling of the product 
the waxman hatch act provides that patent terms may be extended to compensate for some of the patent life that is lost during the fda regulatory review period for the product 
this extension period would generally be one half the time between the effective date of an investigational new drug application and the submission date of a new drug application  plus all of the time between the submission date of a new drug application and the approval of that application  subject to a maximum extension of five years 
similar patent term extensions are available under european laws 
we filed with the united states patent and trademark office  a patent term extension application  for our patent covering the method of treating pulmonary arterial hypertension using remodulin following fda approval 
the application was approved in february and the patent now expires on october  outside the united states  our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include some or all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although within europe  procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union eu member state 
in the eu  marketing authorizations may be submitted to a centralized  a decentralized or a national level process 
the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and high technology products and is available at the applicant s option for other products 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all eu member states 
the decentralized procedure is available for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions  changes existing procedures for national approvals and establishes procedures for coordinated eu actions on products  suspensions and withdrawals 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization for which mutual recognition is sought may submit an application to one or more eu member states  certify that the dossier is identical to that on which the first approval was based or explain any differences and certify that identical dossiers are being submitted to all member states for which recognition is sought 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each eu member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
the procedure encourages member states to work with applicants and other regulatory authorities to resolve disputes concerning mutual recognition 
lack of objection of a given country within days automatically results in approval of the eu country 
following receipt of marketing authorization in a member state  the applicant is then required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate prescription pricing authority in that country 
to secure european regulatory approvals for the use of remodulin for pulmonary arterial hypertension we used the decentralized procedure and filed our first marketing authorization application in france in february review of our application was completed in as a result  remodulin was approved in countries of the eu under the mutual recognition process described above 
we withdrew applications in spain  the united kingdom and ireland with the intent of refiling them in the future with additional clinical data 
regulatory applications for the use of remodulin for pulmonary arterial hypertension have also been approved in canada  israel  australia  switzerland  argentina and chile 
regulatory applications are pending in other countries 
arginine and telemedicine products are manufactured at contract facilities that are regulated by the fda under different regulations that apply to dietary supplements in the case of arginine and medical devices in the case of telemedicine products 
the telemedicine devices designed and sold by medicomp have received marketing clearance from the fda under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act 
medical devices are required to be manufactured in conformance with fda s quality system regulations 
in the united states  reimbursements are provided for remodulin by many independent third party payers  as well as the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare is the federal program which provides health care benefits to certain senior citizens and disabled persons  and medicaid is the federal program administered by states to provide health care benefits to certain financially disadvantaged persons 
the medicare contractors who administer the program provide reimbursement for remodulin at a rate generally equal to percent of the published average wholesale price  as recommended by us 
the state medicaid programs generally provide reimbursement for remodulin at a price that is below the published average wholesale price 
beginning in  the medicare modernization act requires that we and the centers for medicare and medicaid services negotiate a new price for remodulin 
in return for agreeing to include remodulin in the medicare and medicaid programs  we have agreed to pay a rebate to state medicaid agencies that provide reimbursement for remodulin 
we have also agreed to sell remodulin under contracts with the veterans administration  department of defense  public health service and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated as b entities which are entities designated by federal programs to receive discounted drug prices at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to our distributors 
these programs and contracts impose many regulations and restrictions on our business 
failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in a loss of our ability to continue receiving reimbursement for remodulin 
we estimate that between percent of remodulin sales in the united states are reimbursed under the medicare and medicaid programs 
employees we had approximately employees as of february  we also maintain active independent contractor relationships with various individuals  most of whom are on month to month or annual consulting contracts 
we believe our employee relations are excellent

unless the context requires otherwise or unless otherwise noted  all references in this section to united therapeutics and to the company  we  us or our are to united therapeutics corporation and its subsidiaries 
actual consolidated revenues and net income may be different from published securities analyst projections 
in addition  we have a history of losses and may not continue to be profitable 
many independent securities analysts have published quarterly and annual projections of our revenues and profits 
these projections were made independently by the securities analysts based on their own analysis 
such estimates are inherently subject to a degree of uncertainty 
as a result  the actual revenues and net income may be greater or less than projected by such securities analysts 
even small variations in reported revenues and profits as compared to securities analysts expectations can lead to significant changes in our stock price 
although we were profitable for every quarter ended after march   we lost money from the date of our inception in through march  at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
factors that could affect consolidated revenues and profitability and cause our quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate include the following extent and timing of sales of remodulin to distributors  levels of remodulin inventory held by our distributors and changes to those levels from quarter to quarter  level of patient demand for remodulin and other products  changes in prescribers opinions about remodulin  impact of medical and scientific opinion about our products  levels of research and development  selling  general and administrative expenses  timing of payments to licensors and corporate partners  retention and growth of patients treated with remodulin  remodulin side effects  including impact of infusion site pain and reaction from subcutaneous use of remodulin  changes in the current pricing and dosing of remodulin  changes in the length of time that remodulin vials may be used by patients  changes in the pricing of other therapies approved for pah  including possible generic formulations of other approved therapies  such as flolan  which may be sold in generic form beginning in may  willingness of private insurance companies  medicare and medicaid to reimburse remodulin at current pricing levels  impacts of new legislation and regulations and changes to the medicare and medicaid programs  the outcome of the remodulin phase iv post marketing study  our ability to maintain regulatory approval of remodulin in the united states and other countries  additional regulatory approvals for remodulin in countries other than where it is currently sold  status and impact of other approved competitive products such as ventavis  revatio  tracleer and flolan and investigational competitive products such as ambrisentan  thelin  cialis  gleevec and other potential investigational competitive products  continued performance by current remodulin distributors under existing agreements  size  scope and outcome of development efforts for existing and additional products  future milestone and royalty payments under license and other agreements  cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory reviews  rate of technological advances  our ability to establish  defend and enforce intellectual property rights  development of manufacturing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party manufacturing arrangements  establishment  continuation or termination of third party clinical trial arrangements  development of sales and marketing resources or the establishment  continuation or termination of third party sales and marketing arrangements  impact of any regulatory restrictions on our marketing and promotional activities  recovery of goodwill  intangible assets and investments in affiliates  collection of accounts receivable and realization of inventories  risks associated with acquisitions  including the ability to integrate acquired businesses  unforeseen expenses  actual growth in sales of telemedicine and arginine products  actual expenses incurred in future periods  and completion of additional acquisitions and execution of licensing agreements 
most of our pharmaceutical products are in clinical studies 
we might not maintain or obtain regulatory approvals for our pharmaceutical products and may not be able to sell our pharmaceutical products commercially 
even if we sell our products  we may not be profitable and may not be able to sustain any profitability we achieve 
we may not successfully compete with established drugs and the companies that develop and market them 
we compete with established drug companies during product development for  among other things  funding  access to licenses  expertise  personnel  clinical trial patients  and third party collaborators 
we also compete with these companies following approval of our products 
almost all of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than we do 
we are aware of existing treatments that compete with our products  especially in the field of pah 
patients and doctors may perceive these competing products to be safer  more effective  more convenient or less expensive than remodulin 
accordingly  sales of remodulin may not increase or may even decrease if doctors prescribe less remodulin than they are prescribing at present 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with many approved products in the united states and worldwide  including the following flolan was the first product approved by the fda for treating pah and has been marketed by glaxosmithkline plc since generic formulations of flolan could be available for commercial sale as early as flolan is delivered by intravenous infusion and considered to be an effective treatment by most pah experts  ventavis was approved in december in the united states and in september in europe 
ventavis is the only prostacyclin that has been approved for inhalation  whereas remodulin is only currently approved to be delivered through intravenous or subcutaneous infusion 
ventavis is marketed by cotherix  inc in the united states and schering ag in europe  tracleer  the first oral drug to be approved for pah  is also the first drug in its class  known as endothelin receptor antagonists 
tracleer was approved in december in the united states and may in europe 
tracleer is marketed by actelion  ltd 
worldwide 
as an oral therapy  tracleer is a very convenient therapy  and revatio was approved in june in the united states 
revatio is also an oral therapy and is marketed by pfizer 
revatio is a different formulation of the very successful drug viagra and is the first drug in its class  known as pde inhibitors  to be approved for pah 
doctors may reduce the dose of remodulin given to their patients if they prescribe our competitors products in combination with remodulin 
many companies are marketing and developing products containing arginine that compete with our arginine product line 
many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors provide cardiac holter and event monitoring services and systems that compete with our telemedicine products 
a number of drug companies are pursuing treatments for ovarian and other cancers and hepatitis that will compete with any products we may develop from our immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform and glycobiology antiviral agents platform 
discoveries or developments of new technologies by others may make our products obsolete or less useful 
other companies may make discoveries or introduce new products that render all or some of our technologies and products obsolete or not commercially viable 
researchers are continually making new discoveries that may lead to new technologies to treat the diseases for which our products are intended 
in addition  alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases  such as gene therapy  may make our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other investigational therapies for pah could be used in combination with remodulin 
if this happens  doctors may reduce the dose of remodulin given to their patients 
this could result in less remodulin being used by such patients and  hence  reduced sales of remodulin 
we are aware of investigational products being developed for the treatment of pah with which our products may have to compete 
our remodulin based products may have to compete with investigational products currently being developed by other companies  including sitaxentan thelin is being developed by encysive pharmaceuticals  inc worldwide for the treatment of pah 
encysive has completed testing of thelin  an oral tablet  and  based on favorable results  has filed for approval with the food and drug administration in the united states 
this application is currently being reviewed 
if approved  thelin would become the second drug available in the class known as endothelin receptor antagonists  ambrisentan is being developed by myogen  inc for the treatment of pah 
ambrisentan  an oral tablet  is still in clinical testing and is also an endothelin receptor antagonist  cialis is an approved oral treatment for erectile dysfunction and is currently marketed by lilly icos llc  a joint venture of eli lilly company and icos corporation 
cialis is currently being studied in patients with pah  and is in the same class of drugs as revatio  gleevec is an approved oral treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia a cancer of the blood and bone marrow and is currently marketed by novartis pharmaceuticals corporation 
recently  researchers experienced in pah have conducted studies of gleevec and believe that it may be effective in treating pah  prx  a serotonin receptor htb antagonist  is being developed by predix pharmaceuticals holdings  inc  as an oral tablet for the treatment of pah 
two phase i clinical trials of prx are being conducted in healthy volunteers  pulmolar is being developed by pr pharmaceuticals  inc it is a once a month injectible which contains a metabolite of estradiol and has been shown in animal and cell models to address the key pathological processes associated with pah  and aviptadil  an inhaled formulation of vasoactive intestinal protein  is being developed by mondobiotech holding sa  for the treatment of pah 
there may be additional drugs in development for pah and there may also be currently approved drugs that may be effective in treating the disease 
if any of these drugs in development or other currently approved drugs are used to treat pah  sales of remodulin may fall 
if third party payers will not reimburse patients for our drug products or if third party payers limit the amount of reimbursement  our sales will suffer 
our commercial success depends heavily on third party payers  such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  agreeing to reimburse patients for the costs of our pharmaceutical products 
these third party payers frequently challenge the pricing of new and expensive drugs  and it may be difficult for pharmacies selling remodulin to convince these payers to reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin 
remodulin and the associated infusion pump and supplies are very expensive 
we believe our investigational products  if approved  will also be very expensive 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin therapy 
in the past  medicare has not reimbursed the full cost of the therapy for some patients 
beginning on january   the medicare modernization act requires that we and the centers for medicare and medicaid services negotiate a new price for remodulin 
third party payers may not approve our new products for reimbursement or continue to approve remodulin for reimbursement  or may seek to reduce the amount of reimbursement for remodulin based on changes in pricing of other therapies for pah  including possible generic formulations of other approved therapies  such as flolan  which may be sold in generic form beginning in may if third party payers do not approve a product of ours for reimbursement or limit the amount of reimbursement  sales will suffer  as patients will opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement 
we rely on third parties to develop  market  distribute and sell most of our products and those third parties may not perform 
we are currently marketing products in three of our five therapeutic platforms remodulin in our prostacyclin analog platform  the products containing arginine in our arginine formulations platform  and cardiopal cardiac event monitors and holter monitors in our telemedicine platform 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical studies  obtain regulatory approvals  market  distribute or sell most of our products and intend to rely substantially on experienced third parties to perform all of those functions 
we may not locate acceptable contractors or enter into favorable agreements with them 
if third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we might not be able to obtain marketing approvals and sell our products 
medtronic minimed is our exclusive partner for the subcutaneous delivery of remodulin using the minimed microinfusion device for pah 
we rely on medtronic minimed s experience  expertise and performance 
any disruption in the supply to pah patients of minimed s microinfusion device could delay or prevent patients from initiating or continuing remodulin therapy  which could adversely affect our revenues 
similarly  we rely on accredo therapeutics  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of medco health solutions  inc  curascript a wholly owned subsidiary of express scripts  inc and formerly priority healthcare corporation and caremark  inc to market  distribute  and sell remodulin in the united states 
accredo  curascript and caremark are also responsible for convincing third party payers to reimburse patients for the cost of remodulin  which is very expensive 
if our partners and contractors do not achieve acceptable profit margins  they may not continue to distribute our products 
if our partners in the united states and internationally are unsuccessful in their efforts  our revenues will suffer 
during  two of our remodulin distributors in the united states were sold to larger companies 
these distributors continue to purchase remodulin from us and distribute it 
together  they account for most of the remodulin sales we have made thus far 
when these distributors were independently managed  distribution of remodulin was more significant to the distributors  because they were much smaller 
now  remodulin is much less significant to the distributors because they are divisions or subsidiaries of multi billion dollar companies 
it is possible  therefore  that these distributors may devote fewer resources to the distribution of remodulin 
if so  this may negatively impact our sales 
if we cannot maintain regulatory approvals for our products  we cannot sell those products and our revenues will suffer 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacture  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are subject to extensive regulation 
any new product approvals we receive in the future could include significant restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
product approvals  if granted  can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements including those relating to misleading advertising and we already received one warning letter from the fda related to advertising in which was resolved satisfactorily or upon the occurrence of adverse events following commercial introduction of the products 
the fda has approved remodulin for the treatment of pah in patients with class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
this approval is subject to the requirement that we perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
continued fda approval of remodulin is subject to the diligent and timely completion of that trial  as well as its outcome 
the patient phase iv clinical trial was required to have been one half enrolled by june and to have been fully enrolled by june the final study report was required to have been submitted in december twenty two patients were enrolled in the phase iv trial 
enrolling patients in this study is difficult  in part because it involves randomizing some of the patients to placebo despite the fact that approved drugs were available for these patients 
we did not enroll the phase iv trial within the time frame specified by the fda  and therefore are at risk of the fda at any time instituting a public hearing to withdraw marketing approval for remodulin 
the fda permitted an interim assessment and opportunity to terminate the phase iv study after only patients completed the study 
in july  the first patients completed the study and we performed the interim assessment 
the results of the interim assessment  as analyzed by an independent statistician  were positive 
the p value was  meaning that the likelihood that the achieved result was incorrect is six out of ten thousand 
specifically  of patients in the remodulin arm were able to successfully transition from flolan and complete the study without the need to institute rescue therapy  compared to only of patients in the placebo arm 
based on this positive outcome  we have submitted the interim study results to the fda and have requested permission to end the phase iv clinical study in satisfaction of our phase iv commitments 
by agreement with the fda  enrollment in the phase iv clinical study was suspended pending fda review and acceptance of the interim study results 
we do not know how long the fda will take to review the interim study results  and we cannot predict the outcome of the review 
if the fda does not accept the interim study results or does not agree with our assessment of the interim results  we would still be required to comply with the fda approved protocol for the phase iv clinical study  including enrolling patients in the study and submitting the final study report by december the fda could  among other things  grant an extension of time to continue to enroll the trial  or institute a public hearing to withdraw marketing approval for remodulin 
we rely heavily on sales of remodulin 
during the year ended december   our remodulin sales accounted for percent of our total revenues 
if approvals are withdrawn for a product  we cannot sell that product and our revenues will suffer 
in addition  if product approvals are withdrawn  governmental authorities could seize our products or force us to recall our products 
our products may not be commercially successful because physicians and patients may not accept them 
even if regulatory authorities approve our products  these products may not be commercially successful 
we expect that most of our products  including remodulin  which is already approved by the fda  will be very expensive 
patient acceptance of and demand for our products will depend largely on the following factors acceptance by physicians and patients of our products as safe and effective therapies  willingness of payers to reimburse and the level of reimbursement of drug and treatment costs by third party payers such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies  safety  efficacy  pricing and convenience of alternative products  convenience and ease of administration of our products  and prevalence and severity of side effects associated with our products  including the infusion site pain and reaction associated with the use of subcutaneous remodulin and the potential for infections associated with intravenous remodulin 
we have limited experience with manufacturing and depend on third parties  who may not perform  to synthesize and manufacture many of our products 
prior to our acquisition of synquest  inc  a company that manufactured treprostinil  the bulk active ingredient in remodulin  we had no experience with manufacturing 
presently  commercial treprostinil is being manufactured only by us 
we rely on third parties for the manufacture of all our products other than treprostinil 
we rely on baxter healthcare corporation for the formulation of remodulin from treprostinil 
we rely on cardinal health  inc for stability studies on remodulin  the formulation of treprostinil for inhalation use  and analyses of other products that we are developing 
we rely on msi of central florida  inc to manufacture our telemedicine devices 
we rely on other manufacturers to make our investigational drugs for use in trials 
although there are a limited number of companies that could replace each of these suppliers  we believe that other suppliers could provide similar services and materials 
a change in suppliers  however  could cause a delay in distribution of remodulin and other products  and in the conduct of clinical trials and commercial launch  which would adversely affect our research and development efforts and future sales efforts 
our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacturing processes for some of our products have not been tested in quantities needed for commercial sales  delays in scale up to commercial quantities could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products  a long lead time is needed to manufacture remodulin  and the manufacturing process is complex  we and the manufacturers of our products are subject to the fda s good manufacturing practices regulations and similar foreign standards  and although we control compliance issues with respect to synthesis and manufacturing conducted internally  we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by our third party manufacturers  even if we and the manufacturers of our products comply with the fda s good manufacturing practices regulations and similar foreign standards  the sterility and quality of the products being manufactured may be deficient 
if this occurred  such products would not be available for sale or use  if we have to change to another manufacturing contractor or abandon our own manufacturing operations  the fda and comparable foreign regulators would require new testing and compliance inspections  and the new manufacturer would have to be educated in the processes necessary for the production of the affected product  we may not be able to develop or commercialize our products  other than remodulin  as planned or at all and will have to rely solely on internal manufacturing capacity  we intend to transfer all of our drug laboratory operations to the silver spring  maryland facility currently being built  and such transfer could result in manufacturing inefficiencies or delays because the building  equipment and many of the employees being deployed there will be new to the process of making our products 
additionally  the fda and comparable foreign regulators will require new testing and compliance inspections and this could result in delays  the supply of raw and advanced materials and components used in the manufacture of remodulin and other products may be interrupted  which could delay the manufacture and subsequent sale of such products 
any proposed substitute materials and components are subject to approval by the fda before any manufactured product can be sold 
the timing of such fda approvals is difficult to predict and approvals may not be timely obtained  without substantial experience in operating a manufacturing facility  we may not be able to successfully manufacture remodulin without a third party manufacturer  and we may not have intellectual property rights  or may have to share intellectual property rights  to many of the improvements in the manufacturing processes or new manufacturing processes for our new products 
any of these factors could delay clinical studies or commercialization of our products  entail higher costs and  result in our inability to effectively sell our products 
if our products fail in clinical studies  we will not be able to obtain or maintain fda and foreign approvals and will not be able to sell those products 
in order to sell our pharmaceutical products  we must receive regulatory approvals 
to obtain those approvals  we must conduct clinical studies demonstrating that the drug product  including its delivery mechanism  is safe and effective 
if we cannot obtain approval from the fda for a product  that product cannot be sold  and our revenues will suffer 
we recently conducted a phase iv clinical study for remodulin 
for a description of the status of this phase iv study  see our discussion above under factors that may affect united therapeutics if we cannot maintain regulatory approvals for our products  we cannot sell those products and our revenues will suffer 
we have initiated a phase ii iii clinical study of an inhaled formulation of treprostinil and phase i studies of an oral formulation of remodulin 
our lead glycobiology antiviral agent  ut b  recently completed a phase ii  proof of concept study 
in that trial  ut b did not demonstrate efficacy against hepatitis c in a population of patients that previously failed conventional treatments 
we are now conducting preclinical testing of additional glycobiology drug candidates 
we are also currently conducting two phase iii pivotal studies of ovarex for the treatment of ovarian cancer 
we are still completing or planning pre clinical studies for our other products 
in the past  several of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process  including  but not limited to beraprost  which failed in phase iii testing for early stage peripheral vascular disease  ketotop  which failed in phase iii testing for osteoarthritis of the knee  and ut  which failed in phase ii testing for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
also  the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied by product and by the intended use of a product 
we expect that this will likely be the case with future product candidates and we cannot predict the length of time to complete necessary clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval 
our ongoing and planned clinical studies might be delayed or halted for various reasons  including the drug is not effective  or physicians think that the drug is not effective  patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  including site pain  other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective or convenient by physicians or patients  patients die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  drug supplies are not available or suitable for use in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing cause delays in clinical trials 
in addition  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process 
the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may not agree that we have demonstrated that our products are safe and effective 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable federal  state and foreign regulations 
the development  manufacture  distribution  pricing  sales  marketing  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive federal  state and foreign regulation 
while we have developed and instituted corporate compliance programs  we cannot assure that we or our employees are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal  state and foreign regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  including withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  exclusion from government healthcare programs  or other sanctions or litigation 
if the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements we depend on are breached or terminated  we would lose our right to develop and sell the products covered by the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements 
our business depends upon the acquisition  assignment and license of drugs and other products which have been discovered and initially developed by others  including remodulin  all of the products in the immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibody platform  all of the products in the glycobiology antiviral agents platform  and all arginine based products 
under our product license agreements  we are granted certain rights to existing intellectual property owned by third parties subject to the terms of each license agreement  whereas assignment agreements transfer all right  title and ownership of the intellectual property to us  subject to the terms of each assignment agreement 
in addition  we have obtained licenses to other third party technology to conduct our business  including licenses for our products and an alliance agreement for the use of the medtronic minimed microinfusion device for the administration of remodulin 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to other third party technology to commercialize our early stage products 
this dependence has the following risks we may not be able to obtain future licenses  assignments and agreements at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of our licenses or assignments are terminated  we will lose our rights to develop and market the products covered by such licenses or assignments  the licenses and assignments that we hold generally provide for termination by the licensor or assignor in the event we breach the license or assignment agreement  including failing to pay royalties and other fees on a timely basis  in the event that glaxosmithkline formerly glaxo wellcome terminates its assignment agreement or pfizer formerly pharmacia terminates its license agreement  we will have no further rights to utilize the assigned patents or trade secrets to develop and commercialize remodulin 
for the year ended december   sales of remodulin accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues 
glaxosmithkline or pfizer could seek to terminate the assignment or license  respectively  in the event that we fail to pay royalties based on sales of remodulin  and if licensors fail to maintain the intellectual property licensed or assigned to us as required by most of our license and assignment agreements  we may lose our rights to develop and market some or all of our products and may be forced to incur substantial additional costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or force the licensor or assignor to do so 
certain license and assignment agreements relating to our products may restrict our ability to develop products in certain countries and or for particular diseases and impose other restrictions on our freedom to develop and market our products 
when we acquire  license or receive assignments of drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others  we may receive rights only to develop such drugs or products in certain territories and not throughout the world 
for example  we do not have the right to develop ovarex and all our other monoclonal antibody immunotherapies for sale in most of europe and the middle east  and we only have the rights to develop beraprost for sale in the united states and canada 
in addition  provisions in our license and assignment agreements impose other restrictions on our freedom to develop and market our products 
for example  in assigning remodulin to us  glaxosmithkline retained an exclusive option and right of first refusal to negotiate a license agreement with us if we ever decide to license any aspect of the commercialization of remodulin anywhere in the world 
similarly  in connection with its licenses of beraprost to us  toray industries  inc obtained a right of first refusal from us to develop and sell in japan up to two compounds that we develop 
we also agreed to provisions giving toray the conditional right to approve our north american distributor  a conditional restricted non competition clause  and to minimum annual sales in order to maintain our exclusive rights to beraprost 
the restrictions that we have accepted in our license and assignment agreements restrict our freedom to develop and market our products in the future 
if our patent and other intellectual property protection is inadequate  our sales and profits could suffer or competitors could force our products completely out of the market 
our united states patent for the method of treating pulmonary hypertension with remodulin is currently set to expire in october the patent for ovarex and its method of use are the subject of a combination of issued patents and pending applications in the united states and around the world 
the issued patents for ovarex have expiration dates ranging from to we believe that some of the patents to which we have rights may be eligible for extensions of up to five years based upon patent term restoration procedures in europe and in the united states under the waxman hatch act 
competitors may develop products based on the same active ingredients as our products  including remodulin  and market those products after the patents expire  or may design around our existing patents 
if this happens  our sales would suffer and our profits could be severely impacted 
patents may be issued to others that prevent the manufacture or sale of our products 
we may have to license those patents and pay significant fees or royalties to the owners of the patents in order to keep marketing our products 
this would cause profits to suffer 
we have been granted patents in the united states for the synthesis of remodulin  but patent applications that have been or may be  filed by us may not result in the issuance of additional patents 
the scope of any patent issued may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we intend to sell our products may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technology advances 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and others  but these agreements may not be effective in protecting our proprietary information 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or obtain access to our know how 
litigation  which is very expensive  may be necessary to enforce or defend our patents or proprietary rights and may not end favorably for us 
we are currently a party to pending litigation against other parties believed to have violated our patents related to our arginine products line  and the validity and enforceability of the patents related to our arginine products is currently being challenged 
we may also choose to initiate litigation against other parties who we come to believe are infringing these patents 
if such litigation is unsuccessful or if the patents are invalidated or canceled  we may have to write off the related intangible assets and such an event could significantly reduce our earnings 
any of our licenses  patents or other intellectual property may be challenged  invalidated  canceled  infringed or circumvented and may not provide any competitive advantage to us 
if our highly qualified management and technical personnel leave us  our business may suffer 
we are dependent on our current management  particularly our founder and chief executive officer  martine rothblatt  phd  our president and chief operating officer  roger jeffs  phd  our executive vice president for business development and chief financial officer  fred hadeed  our executive vice president for strategic planning  general counsel and corporate secretary  paul mahon  our executive vice president and chief operating officer for production  david walsh  our senior vice president for pharmaceutical development  david zaccardelli  pharmd  and our senior vice president for biologics production  development and supply  james levin  dvm 
while these individuals are employed by us pursuant to multi year employment agreements  employment agreements do not ensure the continued retention of employees 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on these officers 
our success will depend in part on retaining the services of our existing management and key personnel and attracting and retaining new highly qualified personnel 
expertise in the field of cardiovascular medicine  infectious disease and oncology is not generally available in the market  and competition for qualified management and personnel is intense 
we may not have adequate insurance and may have substantial exposure to payment of product liability claims 
the testing  manufacture  marketing  and sale of human drugs involve product liability risks 
although we currently have product liability insurance covering claims up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate for our pharmaceutical products and product liability insurance covering claims up to million per occurrence and in the aggregate for our telemedicine and arginine supplement products  we may not be able to maintain this product liability insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all 
in addition  this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses 
if claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may go out of business 
we may not have  or may have to share rights to  future inventions arising from our license  assignment and alliance agreements and may lose potential profits or savings 
pursuant to our agreements with certain business partners  any new inventions or intellectual property that arise from our activities will be owned jointly by us and these partners 
if we do not have rights to new developments or inventions that arise during the terms of these agreements  or we have to share the rights with others  we may lose some or all of the benefit of these new rights  which may mean a loss of future profits or savings generated from improved technology 
if we need additional financing and cannot obtain it  product development and sales may be limited 
we may need to spend more money than currently expected because we may need to change our product development plans or product offerings to address difficulties with clinical studies  to prepare for commercial sales or to continue sales of remodulin 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if additional funds are not available  we may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
our activities involve hazardous materials  and improper handling of these materials could expose us to significant liabilities 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals and hazardous materials 
as a consequence  we are subject to numerous federal  state  and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the management  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations  and substantial fines and penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations 
while we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with laws and regulations governing these materials  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be liable for civil damages that result or for the cleanup of any release of hazardous materials  the cost of which could be substantial 
any such liability could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price could be volatile and could decline 
the market prices for securities of drug and biotechnology companies are highly volatile  and there are significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may be unrelated to particular companies operating performances 
the table below sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated high low january  december  january  december  january  december  our stock price could decline suddenly due to the following factors  among others quarterly and annual financial and operating results  failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts or our projections  public concern as to the safety of products developed by us or by others  changes in or new legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement of remodulin by medicare or medicaid  announcements by us or others of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  future sales of substantial amounts of common stock by us or our existing stockholders  the pace of enrollment in and the results of clinical trials  future sales of common stock by our directors and officers  failure to maintain approvals to sell remodulin  timing and outcome of additional regulatory approvals  and general market conditions 
future sales of shares of our common stock may depress our stock price 
if we issue common stock to raise capital  or our stockholders transfer their ownership of our common stock or sell a substantial number of shares of common stock in the public market  or investors become concerned that substantial sales might occur  the market price of our common stock could decrease 
in february  we filed a shelf registration statement covering the potential sale of up to five million shares of our common stock 
in addition  each of our four executive officers has announced their adoption of b prearranged trading plans 
in accordance with these plans  twice each month these executives sell a specified number of our common stock either owned by them or acquired through the exercise of stock options 
however  these executives and our directors may choose to sell additional shares outside of b trading plans and one executive and five directors have done so 
in addition  toray industries  inc has an option to acquire  shares of our common stock and piggyback registration rights with respect to such shares that arise if and when this option becomes exercisable 
a decrease in our common stock price could make it difficult for us to raise capital by selling stock or to pay for acquisitions using stock 
to the extent outstanding options are exercised or additional shares of capital stock are issued  existing stockholders may incur additional dilution 
provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that could be beneficial to us and our public stockholders 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities  and the replacement or removal of current management by our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation divides the board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for stockholders to change the majority of directors and may hinder accumulations of large blocks of common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
this may further result in discouraging a change of control or change in current management 
our existing directors and executive officers own a substantial block of our stock and might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval 
our directors and named executive officers beneficially owned approximately percent of our outstanding common stock as of december   including stock options that could be exercised by those directors and executive officers within days of that date 
accordingly  these stockholders as a group might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of our directors 
such stockholder influence could delay or prevent a change of control with respect to us 
if stockholders do not receive dividends  stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain our earnings for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future

overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic products for patients with chronic and life threatening cardiovascular  cancer and infectious diseases 
we commenced operations in june and  since our inception  have devoted substantially all of our resources to acquisitions and research and development programs 
united therapeutics products and services our lead product is remodulin  which is a prostacyclin analog  or a stable synthetic form of prostacyclin  an important molecule produced by the body that has powerful effects on blood vessel health and function 
on may   the united states food and drug administration fda approved subcutaneous injection under the skin use of remodulin treprostinil sodium injection for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension  or pah  in patients with nyha class ii iv symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
pah is a life threatening condition characterized by elevated blood pressures between the heart and lungs 
we were required to perform a post marketing phase iv clinical study to confirm the clinical benefits of remodulin 
continued fda approval of remodulin is subject to the diligent and timely completion of that phase iv trial  as well as its outcome 
the study was originally to have been completed by may and involve patients 
in mid  the fda agreed to amend the due date of the final study report and make other changes to the trial design including reducing the number of patients to the amended phase iv clinical trial was required to have been one half enrolled by june and to have been fully enrolled by june  with a final study report due december these enrollment deadlines were not met  and a final study report was not submitted 
although the phase iv clinical trial  as amended  established deadlines and required a final report in december the fda permitted an interim assessment and opportunity to terminate the phase iv study after only patients have completed the study 
in july  the first patients completed the study and we performed an interim assessment 
the results of the interim assessment  as analyzed by an independent statistician  were positive 
the p value was  meaning that the likelihood that the achieved result was incorrect is six out of ten thousand 
specifically  of patients in the remodulin arm were able to successfully transition from flolan  which they had previously been using to treat their condition  and complete the study without the need to institute rescue therapy  compared to only of patients in the placebo arm 
based on this positive outcome  we submitted the interim study results to the fda in july  and requested permission to end the phase iv clinical study in satisfaction of our phase iv commitments 
by agreement with the fda  enrollment in the phase iv clinical study was suspended pending fda review and acceptance of the interim study results 
if the fda does not accept the interim study results or does not otherwise agree with our assessment of the interim results  the fda could  among other things  grant an extension of time to continue to enroll the trial  or institute a public hearing to withdraw marketing approval for remodulin 
if a withdrawal hearing were instituted by the fda  we would pursue the opportunity to participate in the hearing  as we believe that we have exercised good faith due diligence in pursuing enrollment of this trial 
on november   the fda approved intravenous infusion of remodulin  based on data establishing its bioequivalence with the previously approved subcutaneous administration of remodulin  for patients who are not able to tolerate a subcutaneous infusion 
this approval was also conditioned upon the diligent and timely completion of the phase iv trial  as well as its outcome 
remodulin is also approved for subcutaneous use in most of europe  canada  israel  australia  argentina and chile 
it is also approved for intravenous use in canada and israel 
marketing authorization applications are currently under review in other countries 
the mutual recognition process to obtain approvals from european union member countries for subcutaneous use of remodulin was completed in august  with positive decisions received from most european union countries 
we withdrew applications in ireland  spain and the united kingdom and are engaged in regulatory discussions concerning the timing of resubmission in these three countries 
although these decisions were made in august  the approving european countries may not provide formal action letters and pricing approvals required for the commercial sales of remodulin for as long as up to one to two years  or longer 
we can give no assurances as to the timing and receipt of the formal action letters and pricing approvals from european countries  or the outcome of applications in other countries 
to date  we have received formal action letters and pricing approvals from france and portugal 
we have generated revenues from sales of remodulin and arginine products which deliver an amino acid that is necessary for maintaining cardiovascular function in the united states and other countries 
in addition  we have generated revenues from telemedicine products and services  primarily designed for patients with abnormal heart rhythms called cardiac arrhythmias and poor blood flow to the heart  a condition known as ischemic heart disease  in the united states 
we have funded our operations from the proceeds of sales of our common stock and from revenues from the sales of our products and services 
remodulin marketing and sales remodulin is currently marketed by our own staff of approximately employees who market directly to physicians specialized in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension  comprised mainly of pulmonologists and cardiologists 
we face stiff competition from several other companies that market and sell competing therapies and expect the competition to continue growing 
remodulin is sold to patients in the united states by accredo therapeutics  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of medco health solutions  inc  curascript a wholly owned subsidiary of express scripts  inc and formerly priority healthcare corporation  and caremark  inc  and outside of the united states by various international distributors 
we sell remodulin in bulk shipments to these distributors 
the timing and extent of our sales of remodulin are impacted by the timing and extent of these bulk orders from our distributors 
bulk orders placed by our distributors are determined by them  based on their estimates of the amount of drug required for current and newly starting patients  as well as an inventory equivalent to approximately thirty to sixty days demand as a contingent supply  since discontinuation of therapy can be life threatening to patients 
therefore  sales of remodulin to distributors in any given quarter may not be indicative of patient demand in that quarter 
sales of remodulin and remodulin delivery pumps and supplies are recognized as revenue when delivered to our distributors 
future prospects while we were profitable in each quarter since april   we incurred net losses for all quarters from inception through march  at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
future profitability will depend on many factors  including timely and successful completion of the remodulin phase iv study discussed above under united therapeutics products and services  the price  level of sales  level of reimbursement by public and private insurance payers  the impacts of competitive products and the number of patients using remodulin and other currently commercialized products and services  as well as the results and costs of research and development projects 
major research and development projects our major research and development projects are focused on the use of remodulin to treat cardiovascular diseases  immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies antibodies that activate a patient s immune response to treat a variety of cancers and glycobiology antiviral agents a novel class of small molecules that may be effective as oral therapies to treat infectious diseases  such as hepatitis 
cardiovascular disease projects subcutaneous use of remodulin was approved by the fda in may for the treatment of pah in nyha class ii iv patients to diminish symptoms associated with exercise 
a condition of continued fda approval is that a phase iv clinical study must be completed in a timely and diligent manner as discussed above under united therapeutics products and services 
material net cash inflows from the sales of remodulin for pah commenced in may after fda approval was received 
remodulin was also approved in most of europe  canada  israel  australia  argentina and chile for similar uses 
marketing authorization applications are currently under review in other countries 
on march   the manufacturer of the medtronic c infusion pump  which is used for the subcutaneous administration of remodulin  received fda approval for intravenous use of the pump 
it was previously approved for subcutaneous use only 
we are currently completing an evaluation of the medtronic c infusion pump for use with intravenous remodulin in patients with pah 
studies were done in adult and pediatric patients to explore logistics associated with use of this pump and to expand clinical information 
in march  we commenced a week placebo controlled trial of intravenous remodulin in patients with pah to further assess the clinical benefits of remodulin 
the trial was conducted in india and was designed to enroll up to patients 
interim results of this trial were to be analyzed after  and patients completed the week trial 
in august  after enrolling approximately patients  we suspended enrollment of new patients  per the recommendation of the trial s independent data safety monitoring board  which is a panel of independent experts 
preliminary results from the patients were positive p 
specifically  intravenous remodulin produced an meter median improvement in six minute walk distance compared to placebo after twelve weeks 
we are in an early stage of developing oral and a later state of developing inhaled formulations of treprostinil  which is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in remodulin 
during  we completed dosage studies of oral formulations of treprostinil in healthy volunteers 
we filed an investigational new drug application on january  to perform an additional phase i healthy volunteer study 
on july   the european medicines agency announced that oral treprostinil had been granted orphan product status in the european union 
presently  we are planning placebo controlled multi national trials of oral treprostinil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
during and  independent clinical investigators in europe and the united states performed small uncontrolled trials of inhaled formulations of treprostinil in patients with pah 
in june  lung rx  inc  a subsidiary of united therapeutics  commenced a week placebo controlled trial of inhaled treprostinil in at least patients with pah who are also being treated with tracleer 
the trial is known as triumph  treprostinil inhalation used in the management of pulmonary hypertension  and is being conducted at approximately centers in the united states and in europe 
additional centers are expected to be added during as of december   approximately patients have been enrolled in this trial 
as of february   the trial is approximately one half enrolled 
we incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  on remodulin development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred on remodulin development 
cancer disease projects our monoclonal antibody immunotherapies were licensed in april from altarex medical corp 
ovarex mab is the lead product and is currently being studied in two identical phase iii clinical trials in advanced ovarian cancer stage iii and iv patients 
these studies  which commenced in january  are being conducted at approximately centers throughout the united states and will enroll at least patients 
as of december  approximately patients have been enrolled in these trials 
these studies could take up to two years to complete following full enrollment  depending on how long it takes for each study to reach at least relapse events 
we incurred expenses of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  on ovarex development 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred on ovarex development 
infectious disease projects our infectious disease program includes glycobiology antiviral drug candidates in the preclinical and clinical stages of testing 
the drugs in this program are being developed for hepatitis c  hepatitis b and other infectious diseases 
we completed acute and chronic phase i clinical dosing studies for our first candidate for the treatment of hepatitis c  ut b  to assess safety in healthy volunteers in early we initiated phase ii clinical studies in patients infected with hepatitis c in july and completed those studies in october in that trial  ut b did not demonstrate efficacy against hepatitis c in a population of patients that previously failed conventional treatments 
we are now conducting preclinical testing of additional glycobiology drug candidates 
we incurred expenses of approximately million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  for our infectious disease programs 
approximately million from inception to date has been incurred for infectious disease programs 
project risks due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the drug development  regulatory review and approval processes  the anticipated completion dates  the cost of completing the research and development and the period in which material net cash inflows from these projects are expected to commence are not known or estimable 
there are many risks and uncertainties associated with completing the development of the unapproved products discussed above  including the following products may fail in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not be willing to participate in clinical studies  hospitals  physicians and patients may not properly adhere to clinical study procedures  the drugs may not be safe and effective or may not be perceived as safe and effective  other approved or investigational therapies may be viewed as safer  more effective or more convenient  patients may experience severe side effects during treatment  patients may die during the clinical study because their disease is too advanced or because they experience medical problems that are not related to the drug being studied  other ongoing or new clinical trials sponsored by other drug companies may reduce the number of patients available for our studies  patients may not enroll in the studies at the rate we expect  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may delay or withhold approvals to commence clinical trials or to manufacture drugs  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may request that additional studies be performed  higher than anticipated costs may be incurred due to the high cost of contractors for drug manufacture  research and clinical trials  drug supplies may not be sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  and the results of preclinical testing may cause delays in clinical trials 
if these projects are not completed in a timely manner  regulatory approvals would be delayed and our operations  liquidity and financial position could suffer 
without regulatory approvals  we could not commercialize and sell these products and  therefore  potential revenues and profits from these products would be delayed or impossible to achieve 
financial position cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments including all unrestricted and restricted amounts at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase of approximately million is due primarily to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
restricted cash and marketable investments pledged to secure our obligations under the synthetic operating lease discussed below under off balance sheet arrangement at december  totaled approximately million  as compared with approximately million at december  the increase in restricted cash and marketable investments was due to additional funds placed in these accounts to provide adequate collateral under the lease 
inventories  net of reserves for obsolescence  at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was due primarily to increased levels of remodulin finished goods and work in process  to meet anticipated needs for future sales and clinical trials 
other receivables at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in recoverable import duties on shipments of remodulin to foreign countries of approximately million and in construction draws receivable from wachovia development corporation of approximately million 
investments in affiliates at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in the fair value of our investment in virexx medical corp  based on quoted market prices 
property  plant and equipment at december  were approximately million  as compared to million at december  the increase was due primarily to the purchase of building and land adjacent to the lung rx  inc office located in satellite beach  florida for approximately million 
accounts payable at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the decrease was due generally to the timing of payments to vendors 
accrued expenses at december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase was due primarily to accrued expenses for royalties and clinical trial related expenses and tax withholdings related to december payroll and stock option exercises 
total stockholders equity at december  was approximately million  as compared to million at december  the increase in stockholders equity of approximately million was due primarily to net income earned and the proceeds collected from exercises of stock options during the twelve months ended december  results of operations years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to growth in sales of remodulin to our distributors 
the following sets forth our revenues by source for the periods presented in thousands 
revenues for the years ended december  remodulin telemedicine services and products other products license fees total revenues for the years ended december  and  approximately percent and percent of our revenues  respectively  were earned from three customers located in the united states 
total revenues are reported net of estimated government rebates  prompt pay discounts and fees due to a distributor for services 
we pay government rebates to state medicaid agencies that pay for remodulin 
historically  we estimated our liability for such rebates based on the volume of remodulin dispensed to medicaid patients as reported to us by our distributors and the expected rebate per unit of remodulin as determined by us in accordance with federal guidelines 
since april   we have estimated our liability for such rebates based on the historical level of government rebates invoiced by state medicaid agencies relative to us sales of remodulin 
prompt pay discounts are offered on sales of remodulin if the related invoices are paid in full generally within days from the date of sale 
we estimated our liability for prompt pay discounts based on historical payment patterns 
fees paid to a distributor for services are estimated based on contractual rates for specific services applied to estimated units of service provided by the distributor for the period 
a roll forward of the liability accounts associated with estimated government rebates  prompt pay discounts and fees to a distributor for services as well as the net amount of reductions to revenues for these items are presented as follows in thousands years ended december  liability accounts  at beginning of period additions to liability payments liability accounts  at end of period net reductions to revenues our distributors endeavor to maintain levels of remodulin inventories sufficient to satisfy existing and new demand for the product 
inventory levels held by united states based distributors as reported to us by our distributors at december  and were approximately million and million  respectively  based on our gross selling price 
as remodulin was only recently approved by certain member countries of the european union  inventory levels outside of the united states were not believed to be significant 
in the future  we expect that international sales will increase as remodulin is commercialized in more countries 
due to the inherent difficulties in tracking inventories held by our six international distributors and their numerous sub distributors  inventory information will not be reported in our periodic reports in the future 
product returns were due to arginine products and totaled approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to increased expenses for the remodulin related programs and cancer disease programs of approximately million  and million  respectively  during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  see major research and development projects above  for additional information regarding our research programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel  office expenses  insurance  professional fees  provision for doubtful accounts receivable  depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to the payment of one time application fees of approximately million to european countries as part of the mutual recognition process for remodulin approval and a subsequent filing for approval of intravenous remodulin in europe and increases in salary and related expenses of approximately million  during the year ended december  cost of sales consists of the cost to manufacture or acquire products that are sold to customers 
cost of service sales consists of the salaries and related overhead necessary to provide services to customers 
cost of product sales was approximately of product sales for each of the years ended december  and cost of service sales was approximately of service sales for the year ended december   as compared to approximately for the year ended december  the improvement in the cost of service sales as a percentage of service revenues was due to the growth in service sales during with no corresponding increase in costs 
interest income for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to interest income of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in cash available for investing during and increased market interest rates 
equity loss in affiliate represents our share of northern therapeutics  inc s losses 
the equity loss in affiliate was approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  northern therapeutics  inc s loss was due primarily to expenditures for its autologous non viral vector gene therapy research for pulmonary hypertension and sales and marketing activities for remodulin in canada 
an income tax benefit of approximately million was recognized for the year ended december   as compared to none for the year ended december  the benefit in was due to an approximately million reduction in the valuation allowance of our deferred tax assets as of december  the reduction of the valuation allowance is based on our review of both historical and projected taxable income which has shown that it is more likely than not that certain portions of our deferred tax assets will be realizable and that a reduction of the valuation allowance related to net operating loss carry forwards  business credits and intangible assets capitalized for tax purposes of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  was required 
the benefit from the reduction of the valuation allowance was offset by state income tax expenses and federal alternative minimum income tax expense totalling approximately  and the use of approximately million of state net operating loss carry forwards attributable to stock option deductions which is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
the deferred tax assets may be expensed in future periods as a component of tax expense as we incur additional taxable income 
prior to  due to the company s long history of operating losses  we did not believe our deferred tax assets had a realizable value and they were fully reserved 
as a result  we did not report tax benefits or deferred tax assets prior to years ended december  and revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately million was due primarily to growth in patients using remodulin and the price increase discussed below 
the impact of the price change was to increase revenues from remodulin by approximately million for the year ended december  the following sets forth our revenues by source for the periods presented in thousands 
revenues for the years ended december  remodulin telemedicine services and products other products total revenues remodulin is sold to distributors in the united states at an agreed upon discount from the published average wholesale price awp and to international distributors at an agreed upon transfer price 
in  the published awp of remodulin was per milligram mg for the mg  mg and mg concentrations and per mg for the mg concentration 
in the first quarter of  the published awp for the mg concentration was increased to per mg to achieve uniform pricing

product returns were due to arginine products and totaled approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   expenses for remodulin related programs increased by approximately million while expenses for the infectious disease and cancer programs were reduced by approximately million and million  respectively  as compared to the remaining decrease in total research and development expenses of approximately million was related to reduced expenses in other programs 
see major research and development projects above  for additional information 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to decreases of approximately million in sales and marketing expenses related mostly to arginine products and approximately  in travel expenses 
these decreases were offset by increases of approximately  in professional fees expenses and  in insurance expenses 
cost of product sales was approximately of product sales for the year ended december   which is consistent with approximately for the year ended december  cost of service sales was approximately of service sales for the year ended december   which is consistent with the cost of service sales of approximately for the year ended december  interest income for the year ended december  was approximately million  as compared to interest income of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to an increase in cash available for investing during at december   we owned approximately of northern therapeutics 
the equity loss in affiliate was approximately  for the year ended december   which is consistent with approximately  for the year ended december  northern therapeutics  inc s loss is due primarily to expenditures for its autologous non viral vector gene therapy research for pulmonary hypertension and sales and marketing activities for remodulin in canada 
liquidity and capital resources until june  we financed our operations principally through private placements of common stock 
on june   we completed our initial public offering 
our net proceeds from the initial public offering and sale of the over allotment shares  after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses  were approximately million 
in  we issued common stock in two private placements and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
until  we funded the majority of our operations from such net proceeds of equity 
since  we funded the majority of our operations from revenues  mainly remodulin related  and this is expected to continue 
in february  we filed a primary shelf registration statement with the sec to enable us to offer and sell up to five million shares of our common stock from time to time in one or more offerings 
the shelf registration statement will provide us the flexibility to take advantage of future financing opportunities on terms that we consider advantageous  with terms that would be established at the time of any such offering 
the sec declared the shelf registration statement effective in february our working capital at december  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million at december  the increase is primarily due to a net increase in cash and current marketable investments of approximately million  and an increase in deferred tax assets of approximately million 
restricted cash and marketable investments pledged to secure our obligations under the synthetic operating lease discussed below under off balance sheet arrangement at december  totaled approximately million  as compared with approximately million at december  the increase in restricted cash and marketable investments was due to additional funds placed in these accounts to provide adequate collateral under the lease 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the twelve months ended december  as compared to approximately million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to growth in sales and collections of remodulin 
for the twelve months ended december   we invested approximately million in cash for property  plant and equipment  as compared to approximately million in the twelve months ended december  we made milestone payments totalling  pursuant to existing license agreements during each of the twelve months ended december  and we are obligated to make royalty payments on sales of remodulin which exceed annual net sales of million and on all arginine products 
royalties on sales of all products currently marketed range up to of sales of those products 
we believe that our existing revenues  together with existing capital resources comprised primarily of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  will be adequate to fund our operations 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see item a risk factors actual consolidated revenues and net income may be different from published securities analyst projections 
in addition  we have a history of losses and may not continue to be profitable 
we recognized an income tax expense benefit for the year ended december  due primarily to an approximately million reduction in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at december  based on our determination that certain of these deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable 
at december   we had for federal income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and business tax credit carryforwards of approximately million which expire at various dates from through approximately  million of the net operating loss carryforwards is attributable to exercised stock options  the benefit of which  when realized  directly increases additional paid in capital 
business tax credits can offset future tax liabilities and arise from qualified research expenditures 
we have been and may continue to be subject to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes  even though we have significant net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
section of the internal revenue code limits the utilization of net operating losses when ownership changes occur as defined by that section 
we have reviewed our ownership change position pursuant to section and have determined that ownership changes occurred in december  june  and november and  as a result  the utilization of certain of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
however  we do not expect any significant portion of our net operating loss carry forwards or business tax credits will expire unused 
a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards continues to be fully reserved through a valuation allowance as of december  although we have net operating losses available to offset future taxable income  we may be subject to federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangement in june  we entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
under these agreements  wachovia will fund up to million towards the construction of the laboratory facility on ground owned by us 
the construction phase commenced in and is expected to be completed in early following construction  wachovia will lease the laboratory facility to us with a term ending in may under the year ground lease  wachovia will pay fair value rent to us for use of the land both during the construction phase and after the laboratory lease is terminated 
during the term of the laboratory lease  wachovia will pay per year to us for use of the land 
upon completion of the construction  wachovia will receive rents from us  generally based on applying the day libor rate plus approximately basis points to the amount funded by wachovia towards the construction of the laboratory 
these rents will be paid monthly from the time that the laboratory construction is completed until the termination of the lease in may upon termination of the lease  we will generally have the option of renewing the lease subject to approval of both parties  purchasing the laboratory at a price approximately equal to the funded construction cost or selling it and repaying wachovia the cost of its construction 
we have guaranteed that if the laboratory is sold  wachovia will receive at least percent of the amount it funded towards the construction 
in addition  we agreed to pledge  as collateral  a portion of our marketable investments to secure our lease obligations 
at december   approximately million of marketable investments and cash were pledged as collateral and are reported as restricted marketable investments and cash in our consolidated balance sheet 
this arrangement allows us to construct our laboratory facility without using our own working capital 
we will manage the construction and incur construction costs 
wachovia will then reimburse these construction costs each month as they are incurred 
we will make rent payments to wachovia starting when construction of the facility is completed and through the lease termination in may there will not be any depreciation expense associated with the laboratory facility  since these improvements will be owned by wachovia 
the amount of rent to be paid to wachovia will vary as it is tied to the then current day libor rate plus approximately basis points 
as this rate increases  so will the rents to be paid 
similarly  if this rate decreases  then the amount of rent to be paid to wachovia will also decrease 
we anticipate that rent payments will commence in early  after completion of construction  and continue through termination of the lease in may based on construction costs of up to approximately million and the current effective rate of approximately percent equivalent to the current day libor rate plus approximately basis points at december   the rents to be paid could approximate million annually 
in addition  wachovia paid us ground rent in june totalling an aggregate of approximately  that will be recognized as income ratably through may we guaranteed a minimum residual value of the laboratory facility 
this guaranteed residual is generally equal to percent of the amount funded by wachovia towards construction 
if  at the end of the lease term  we do not renew the lease or purchase the improvements  then the building will be sold to a third party 
in that event  we have guaranteed that wachovia will receive at least this residual value amount 
the maximum potential amount of this guarantee is approximately million  equivalent to percent of expected total construction costs of million 
we have estimated the fair value of this guarantee liability at approximately  and this amount is classified as a non current liability in our balance sheet at december  the lease and other agreements with wachovia require that  among other things  we maintain a consolidated current ratio of not less than and a consolidated net worth of at least million 
the agreements contain other covenants and conditions with which we must comply throughout the construction and lease periods and upon termination of the lease 
if we were unable to comply with these covenants and conditions  the agreements could terminate if the noncompliance was uncured and the parties could not agree otherwise 
a termination of these agreements could result in our acquisition of the improvements from wachovia or the loss of our liquid collateral 
if the agreements are terminated during the construction period due to our default  then we could be required to purchase the improvements 
during construction  the amount we would be required to pay is limited to percent of the construction costs 
in march  we entered into a construction management agreement with turner construction company turner 
turner will manage the construction of the new laboratory facility 
under the terms of the agreement  turner will be responsible for the construction of the facility 
the agreement has a guaranteed maximum price clause in which turner agrees that the construction cost of the facility will not exceed approximately million  which amount is subject to change based on agreed upon changes to the scope of work 
turner will be responsible for covering any costs in excess of the guaranteed maximum price guarantee 
if the ultimate cost of the project is less than the guaranteed maximum price of million  then a portion of the cost savings will be shared with turner 
in addition  turner must pay us penalties if the construction is not completed by april  which date is subject to change based on agreed upon changes to the scope of work 
contractual obligations at december   we had contractual obligations coming due approximately as follows in thousands payment due in total to to and later notes payable and capital lease obligations operating lease obligations construction agreement purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected in the statement of financial position milestone payments operating lease obligations include the estimated lease payments on the laboratory facility being constructed in silver spring  maryland 
the lease is expected to commence in early and will expire in may the lease payments will generally be equal to applying the current day libor rate plus approximately basis points approximately percent at december  to the cost of the construction of the laboratory 
upon termination of the lease  we will generally have the option of renewing the lease  purchasing the laboratory or selling it and repaying wachovia the cost of its construction 
we guaranteed that if the laboratory is sold  wachovia will receive at least percent of the amount it funded towards the construction 
it is estimated that the laboratory will cost approximately million to construct and the guarantee is estimated at approximately million 
the estimated fair value of the guarantee is included in other long term liabilities reflected in the statement of financial position 
see off balance sheet arrangement for additional information 
wachovia is contractually obligated to reimburse these amounts to us under the synthetic operating lease agreement described above under off balance sheet arrangement 
we licensed certain products from other companies under certain license agreements 
these agreements generally include milestone payments to be paid in cash by us upon the achievement of certain product development and commercialization goals set forth in each license agreement 
total milestone payments under these license agreements have been estimated based on the estimated timing of these development and commercialization goals 
summary of critical accounting policies income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a net deferred tax asset or liability is reported in the balance sheet 
at each reporting date  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset is realizable 
if the net deferred tax asset is not fully realizable  then a valuation allowance is established to reduce the amount of net deferred tax asset reported in the balance sheet 
based on the weight of available evidence at december   it was determined that a partial valuation allowance totalling approximately million was necessary at december  remodulin revenue recognition product sales of remodulin are recognized when delivered to distributors  which are our customers for remodulin 
product sales of remodulin delivery pumps and related supplies are recognized when delivered to distributors on a gross basis in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
title to these products passes upon delivery 
had the net basis been applied  the amounts of revenues and cost of product sales reported in the consolidated financial statements would have been lower  but there would have been no impact on net income or losses 
prompt payment discounts  government rebates and fees to a distributor are estimated and recognized as reductions of revenue in the same period that revenues are recognized 
had these discounts  rebates and fees not been reported as reductions of revenue  the amounts reported as revenues and selling expenses would have been higher  but there would have been no impact on net income or losses 
return policies provide that product that has expired or become damaged in shipment may be replaced  but not returned 
therefore  reserves for exchanges are not recorded unless product expiration or damage occurs 
the shelf life of remodulin is two and one half years from the date of its manufacture 
we rely on our distributors to report damage in shipment or expirations of remodulin product 
one of our remodulin distribution agreements stipulated minimum quarterly purchases by the distributor for periods through june  and no minimum quarterly purchases after june  the distribution agreement  however  does not permit the distributor to return remodulin product solely based on the distributor s ability or inability to resell the product 
as a result  revenues from sales to this distributor are recognized in the period that the remodulin product is delivered to the distributor 
during the years ended december   and  approximately million  million and million  of remodulin products were sold to this distributor and recognized as revenue  respectively  and this distributor has made voluntary purchases since june  intangible assets we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test that is performed on october st of each year 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
at december   we believed that goodwill was not impaired and therefore no impairment losses have been recorded 
this conclusion is based on our judgment  taking into consideration expectations regarding future profitability and the status of the reporting units which have reported goodwill 
however  changes in strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact this judgment and require an impairment loss to be recognized for the amount that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
on january   we decided to discontinue the sales  marketing and production of our heartbar line of products  which are arginine enriched dietary supplements 
this discontinuance was effective immediately 
the decision to discontinue heartbar is not meant to impact other aspects of our arginine line of business  which include sales of non heartbar arginine products and license royalties from third parties selling arginine based products 
this decision was made by us after evaluating recent clinical trial results and market potential  among other considerations 
in connection with this discontinuance  we concluded that we will recognize non cash impairment charges totalling approximately million from the write off of the heartbar trademark intangible 
these impairment charges will be recorded in the quarter ending march  the other intangible assets related to the arginine line of business  primarily patents  are not affected by this discontinuance 
marketable investments currently  we invest portions of our cash in marketable debt securities issued primarily by federally sponsored agencies 
due to our intent and ability to hold these marketable debt investments until their maturities  these investments are reported at their amortized cost 
we believe that we are able to hold these investments to maturity  due to the significant level of cash and cash equivalents that we have 
if we did not have the ability and intent to hold these investments to maturity  we would have reported them in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair market values 
at december   the amortized cost of these debt securities was approximately million and their fair values were approximately million 
earnings per share in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share  for the periods with net income  the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options is included in the calculation of dilutive earnings per share using the treasury stock method 
stock options we apply the principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for our stock options issued to our employees 
the following table details the pro forma results had we applied the fair value principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for our employee options in thousands years ended december  net income loss  as reported less total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards pro forma net income loss investments in affiliates the equity method of accounting is used to account for some of our investments in affiliates  including northern therapeutics 
the equity method of accounting generally requires that we report our share of our affiliates net losses or profits in our financial statements  but does not require that assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of the affiliates be consolidated with our consolidated financial statements 
the equity method of accounting is being applied generally due to the lack of control over these affiliates and the levels of ownership held by us 
although our investment in northern therapeutics exceeds percent  minority shareholders possess substantive participating rights that preclude northern therapeutics financial statements from being consolidated 
other investments in affiliates are accounted for on the cost method generally due to the lack of significant influence over these affiliates and a less than percent ownership by us 
the cost method of accounting does not require that we report our share of the affiliates net losses or profits in our financial statements  nor are affiliates assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses consolidated with our consolidated financial statements 
the investment in virexx medical corp 
formerly altarex medical corp 
is accounted for as an available for sale security because its stock is publicly traded 
we own less than percent of virexx 
available for sale securities are reported at their fair values in the balance sheet 
changes in their fair values are reported as other comprehensive income or loss 
declines in values that are considered other than temporary are reported as losses in the statement of operations 
the fair value of the investment was approximately million  million  and million at december   and  respectively  based on quoted market prices 
these changes in fair market value were reported as other comprehensive income or loss 
options issued in exchange for license in june  in connection with our license from toray industries of the sustained release formulation of beraprost an oral prostacyclin analog  we agreed to grant options to purchase  shares of our common stock to toray upon toray s adequate documentation of sustained release beraprost in humans and its transfer of clinical trial material for use in clinical trials in the united states 
these options will not be priced until toray has met this milestone 
if and when the milestone is met  the exercise price of the options would be set at the fair market value of our common stock at that time 
before toray can produce the clinical trial material  it will need to complete formulation  preclinical testing and early clinical studies 
due to the uncertainties in drug development  it is not yet known if toray will provide the appropriate clinical trial material 
therefore  in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees  these options are measured at their lowest aggregate fair value at each interim reporting date  which amount has been zero 
as a result  no expense related to these options has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
lease of laboratory facility in june  we entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
the total amount of the construction is expected to be million 
the laboratory facility will be owned by wachovia  which will act as the lessor  and we will be the lessee and pay rents to wachovia once the facility is completed 
this arrangement is a form of off balance sheet financing under which wachovia will fund percent of the costs for the construction of the property and lease the laboratory facility to us 
we have provided a residual value guarantee to wachovia that the residual value of the leased assets will be at least equal to a specified amount at lease termination 
in accordance with the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for leases  eitf issue no 
 implementation issues in accounting for lease transactions  including those involving special purpose entities  eitf issue no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  we determined that the lease is properly classified as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
furthermore  we determined that wachovia has sufficient substance such that it can be treated as an unrelated entity and  accordingly  does not require consolidation into our financial statements 
operating leases of assets do not require that the leased asset and the related rent obligation be reported in the lessee s balance sheet  but rather be disclosed as future commitments 
in contrast  capital leases do require that the leased asset and rent obligations be reported in the lessee s balance sheet as assets and debt 
changes in the levels of investment made by wachovia and its affiliates in the laboratory could affect the classification of the lease from operating to capital 
in that event  we would include both the assets and debt associated with the laboratory facility on our balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation on december   the fasb issued a revision of sfas no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement statement r was initially required to be implemented by july   but its effective date has been delayed until january  by the securities and exchange commission 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will adopt statement r on january  as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values over the expected period of service 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it should have no impact on our overall financial position 
the full impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement could reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we are unable to estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  the timing and volume of the exercise of stock options 
inventory costs in december  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
inventory cost  which is an amendment to accounting research bulletin no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
sfas no 
clarifies the accounting treatment of certain expenses for inventory costing 
the new standard will be effective for the first fiscal year beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   a substantial portion of our assets was comprised of debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments fluctuates with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to decrease 
likewise  as rates decrease  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to increase 
to minimize such market risk  we hold such instruments to maturity at which time these instruments will be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   we had approximately million in debt securities issued by federally sponsored agencies with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately percent maturing through march and callable annually 
the fair market value of this held to maturity portfolio at december  was approximately million 
at december   a portion of our assets was comprised of auction rate debt securities issued by state sponsored agencies 
while these securities have long term maturities  their interest rates are reset approximately every days through an auction process 
as a result  the interest income from these securities is subject to market risk since the rate is adjusted to accommodate market conditions on each reset date 
however  since the interest rates are reflective of current market conditions  the fair value of these securities typically does not fluctuate from par or cost 
at december   we had approximately million in these debt securities with a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately percent 
the fair market value of these available for sale debt securities as of december  was approximately million 
in june  we entered into a synthetic operating lease and related agreements with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia to fund the construction of a laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
under these agreements  we will pay rents to wachovia generally based on applying the day libor rate plus approximately basis points to the amount funded by wachovia towards the construction of the laboratory 
the total amount of construction is estimated to be approximately million 
at december   the total amount incurred related to the construction was approximately million 
rents will be paid monthly from the time that the laboratory construction is completed until the termination of the lease in may these rents  therefore  are subject to the risk that libor will increase or decrease during the period until termination in may at december   the day libor was approximately percent 
for every movement of basis points percent in the day libor rate  the rents under this lease could increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis
