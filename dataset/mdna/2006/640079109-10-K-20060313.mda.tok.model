item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and also discussed is our financial position as of the end of those periods 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and the notes to those consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the historical performance of our business  its financial condition and its prospects 
the results of operations of our business after the spin off are and will continue to be significantly different than the results of operations of our business prior to the spin off 
this difference results from  among other things  the prices at which we sell pulp to kimberly clark after the spin off  which are significantly different than the prices reflected in transfers of pulp to other kimberly clark operations prior to the spin off  interest expense of new long term debt and incremental selling  general and administrative expenses related primarily to reduced economies of scale as a result of operating on a stand alone basis 
we will discuss and provide our analysis of the following overview of business  business segments  separation from kimberly clark  results of operations and related information  liquidity and capital resources  and critical accounting policies and use of estimates 
overview of business we are a leading north american producer of premium fine papers and technical products 
we also produce bleached kraft market pulp in canada  where we own approximately one million acres of timberlands and have non exclusive rights to harvest wood off approximately million acres of other timberlands 
we have three primary operations our fine paper business  our technical products business and our pulp business 
in managing this diverse pulp and paper business  management believes that achieving and maintaining a leadership position for its fine paper and technical products businesses  responding effectively to competitive challenges  employing capital optimally  controlling costs and managing currency and commodity risks are important to the long term success of the business 
the pulp cycle and general economic conditions also impact our results 
in this discussion and analysis  we will refer to these factors 
market leadership 
achieving and maintaining leadership for our fine paper and technical products businesses have been an important part of our past performance 
we have long been recognized as a leading manufacturer of world class premium writing  text and cover papers used in corporate annual reports  corporate identity packages  invitations  personal stationery and high end packaging 
maintaining our leadership is important to our results  particularly in light of the competitive environment in which we operate 
competitive environment 
our past results have been and future prospects will be significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we experience intense competition for sales of our principal products in our major markets 
our paper business competes directly with well known competitors  some of which are larger and more diversified in most of our markets 
in our pulp business  we have experienced  and will continue to experience  intense competition from suppliers of softwood pulps and southern hemisphere suppliers of hardwood pulps 
we expect our competitors to continue to be aggressive in the future 
cost control 
to improve and maintain our competitive position  we must control our raw material  manufacturing  distribution and other costs 
a significant share of our investments in capital improvements are intended to achieve cost savings and improvements in productivity 
cyclical nature of the pulp industry 
revenues in the pulp industry and our pulp business tend to be cyclical  with periods of shortage and rapidly rising market prices  leading to increased production and increased industry investment until supply exceeds demand 
those periods are then typically followed by periods of reduced market prices and excess and idled capacity until the cycle is repeated 
general economic conditions 
the markets for all of our products are affected to a significant degree by general economic conditions 
downturns and improvements in the us economy or in our export markets affect the demand for our products 
foreign currency and commodity risk 
sales of pulp by our canadian manufacturing facilities are invoiced in us dollars in accordance with industry practice  therefore  no currency effects are presented in our analysis of the change in net sales for our pulp operations 
however  we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates because most of the costs relating to our pulp business are incurred in canadian dollars 
these risks could have a material impact on our results of operations if not effectively managed 
the following charts illustrate changes in currency and pulp prices that occurred during the periods covered by this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pulp price history average quarterly prices graphic source resource information systems  inc us canadian exchange rate history average quarterly exchange rates graphic source resource information systems  inc business segments our fine paper business is a leading producer of premium writing  text  cover and specialty papers used in corporate annual reports  corporate identity packages  invitations  personal stationery and high end packaging 
our products include some of the most recognized and preferred papers in north america  where we enjoy leading market positions in many of our product categories 
we sell our products primarily to authorized paper distributors  converters and specialty businesses  with sales to distributors and distributor owned paper stores accounting for approximately of sales 
we believe that our fine paper manufacturing facilities located in neenah and whiting  wisconsin are among the most efficient in their markets and make us one of the lowest cost producers 
our technical products business is a leading producer of durable  saturated and coated base papers and films for a variety of end uses 
we sell our technical products globally into product categories  and we focus on nine categories where we believe we are a market leader  which include  among others  the tape  label  abrasive  medical packaging and heat transfer technical products markets 
we are also a global supplier of materials used to create customer specific components for furniture  book covers and original equipment manufacturers products 
our customers are located in more than countries and include m company  perfecseal  avery dennison corporation and saint gobain group 
our technical products manufacturing facility is located in munising  michigan 
our pulp business consists of two mills located in pictou  nova scotia and terrace bay  ontario  together with related timberlands 
the pictou mill is comprised of a single line pulp facility which produces primarily softwood pulp  as well as timberlands encompassing approximately one million acres of owned and  acres of licensed or managed land in nova scotia 
in  the pictou mill produced approximately  metric tons of bleached kraft pulp 
in may   we closed the smaller of the two single line pulp facilities at terrace bay the no 
mill 
following the closure of the no 
mill  the terrace bay mill is comprised of a single line pulp facility which produces primarily softwood pulp and a timberlands operation 
terrace bay holds non exclusive rights under a sustainable forest license to harvest wood off approximately million acres of land owned by the province of ontario 
in  the terrace bay mill produced approximately  metric tons of pulp  including approximately  metric tons produced by the no 
mill 
separation from kimberly clark neenah paper  inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware in april  as a wholly owned subsidiary of kimberly clark 
we had no material assets or activities until the transfer to us by kimberly clark of the businesses described in this annual report  which occurred immediately prior to the spin off 
prior to the spin off  kimberly clark had conducted such businesses through various divisions and subsidiaries 
following the spin off  we became an independent  public company  and kimberly clark has no continuing ownership interest in us 
prior to the spin off  we entered into several agreements with kimberly clark in connection with the separation of our business from kimberly clark s businesses 
these agreements included a distribution agreement  a pulp supply agreement  a corporate services agreement  an employee matters agreement and a tax sharing agreement 
the distribution agreement provided for the transfer to us of the assets relating to kimberly clark s canadian pulp business and its fine paper and technical products business in the united states  and the assumption by us of the liabilities relating to these businesses 
the pulp supply agreement supports our transition from a captive pulp producer to a market supplier of pulp 
the corporate services agreement facilitates an orderly transition from being a part of a larger company to a stand alone company 
the employee matters agreement allocates responsibilities relating to employee compensation and benefit plans and programs and other related matters 
the tax sharing agreement governs tax obligations arising out of our business both before and after the spin off 
results of operations and related information in this section  we discuss and analyze our net sales  income before interest and income taxes which we refer to as operating income in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other information relevant to an understanding of our results of operations for the years ended december   and executive summary our operating results were adversely affected by asset impairment losses in each of and and restructuring activities in at our terrace bay facility 
in may  we closed the no 
mill at the terrace bay facility following a strategic review of the facility s operations which indicated that the no 
mill s small scale and high cost did not justify the investment necessary to make it competitive in the global pulp market 
in december and  we recorded pre tax non cash asset impairment losses of million and million  respectively  that in total reduced the carrying value of the terrace bay facility s long lived assets to zero see note of notes to consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
excluding the impact of the restructuring activities and asset impairment losses  operating results in were unfavorable to the prior year primarily due to the continued strength of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  increased discounts on pulp sales to kimberly clark pursuant to our pulp supply agreement  costs related to our operation as a stand alone company and higher raw material and energy costs  partially offset by higher selling prices 
in february  we suspended pulp manufacturing activities at our terrace bay pulp mill as a result of a lack of wood fiber for its operations 
the mill s fiber supply has been exhausted as a result of a strike by the approximately unionized woodlands workers employed by our forestry operations that supply wood fiber to the mill see business employee and labor relations 
most of the approximately hourly and salaried workers employed at the mill were laid off for an indefinite period during the two weeks following the commencement of closure activities 
pursuant to the terms of our labor agreements and canadian laws  if the work stoppage continues through may  we will be required to make payments to laid off workers of approximately million in the second quarter of additional payments of from one to three times that amount could be required dependent upon  among other things  the duration of the work stoppage 
we will continue to incur certain operating costs for the mill during the work stoppage  including costs for a limited number of hourly and salaried employees who will remain at the facility for security operations  boiler and related equipment operation and maintenance during the winter months 
in addition  pulp shipments will continue until the mill s finished goods inventory is exhausted 
pursuant to the terms of our pulp supply agreement with kimberly clark  during the continuance of a terrace bay force majeure event  or a different force majeure event as defined in the pulp supply agreement  we are generally excused  without penalty  from our obligations to supply and kimberly clark is excused  also without penalty  from its commitments to purchase pulp under the pulp supply agreement during the continuance  and to the extent of  such event 
a strike  labor disturbance and other events beyond our control are considered force majeure events under the pulp supply agreement if such events ultimately prevent us from supplying contractually agreed upon quantities of pulp to kimberly clark 
we have suspended substantially all capital expenditures at terrace bay for the duration of the work stoppage 
we have planned capital expenditures for of approximately to million 
the timing and amount of actual capital expenditures in will depend on  among other things  the outcome of negotiations with the labor union see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
availability under our revolving credit facility fluctuates over time depending on the value of our inventory  receivables and various capital assets 
an extended work stoppage could result in a decrease in the value of the assets securing our credit facility and a reduction in availability under the revolving credit facility 
an extended work stoppage at the mill could have a material impact on our liquidity and results of operations 
analysis of net sales years ended december   and the following table presents net sales by segment  expressed as a percentage of total net sales before intersegment eliminations year ended december  fine paper technical products pulp consolidated the following table presents our net sales by segment for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions fine paper technical products pulp intersegment sales consolidated commentary year versus change in net sales versus prior year total change due to change volume net price product mix fine paper technical products pulp a intersegment sales consolidated a sales of pulp by our canadian manufacturing facilities are invoiced in us dollars in accordance with industry practice  therefore  no currency effects are presented in our analysis of the change in net sales for our pulp operations 
consolidated net sales decreased million  or  in compared with primarily due to lower pulp volume and higher discounts on pulp shipments to kimberly clark  partially offset by improvement in pulp product mix 
our fine paper business net sales increased million  or  primarily due to higher average net selling prices  partially offset by lower product mix 
favorable pricing was primarily due to realization of a price increase for most branded products implemented in december and an additional increase for selected branded products in the third quarter of product mix decreased as a result of shipping a higher proportion of lower priced grades 
unit volumes were essentially unchanged from the prior year while the uncoated free sheet market decreased approximately in our technical products business net sales decreased million  or  as growth in unit volumes and favorable product pricing was more than offset by lower heat transfer shipments and a product mix with a higher proportion of relatively lower priced premask and tape volume 
the volume improvement reflected strong growth in sales of premask and tape products partially offset by reduced label shipments 
favorable average net selling prices were due to realization of a price increase implemented in the fourth quarter of and a surcharge implemented in the third quarter of to recover increased costs for oil based latex 
sales and mix were adversely affected by reduced heat transfer shipments related to our termination of a distribution agreement and the shift in sales volumes 
our pulp business net sales decreased million  or  primarily due to lower shipment volumes and higher discounts on pulp shipments to kimberly clark  partially offset by a shift in product mix to a higher proportion of softwood pulp shipments 
pulp shipment volume was lower than the prior year due to the closure of the no 
mill and  to a lesser extent  extended downtime at the terrace bay mill to replenish wood chip inventories 
average net selling prices were unfavorable to the prior year as marginally higher average market prices for softwood pulp were more than offset by higher discounts approximately million on shipments to kimberly clark pursuant to our pulp supply agreement 
product mix increased from the prior year due to a higher proportion of softwood shipments and increased sales of logs to sawmills and veneer manufacturers 
year versus change in net sales versus prior year total change due to change volume net price product mix fine paper technical products pulp a intersegment sales consolidated a sales of pulp by our canadian manufacturing facilities are invoiced in us dollars in accordance with industry practice  therefore  no currency effects are presented in our analysis of the change in net sales for our pulp operations 
consolidated net sales increased million  or  in compared with primarily due to higher average market prices for softwood and hardwood pulp and unit volume growth in the fine paper and technical products businesses 
our fine paper business net sales increased million  or  primarily due to growth in unit volumes 
unit volumes increased due to a strengthening us economy that boosted market demand for premium papers  new product introductions and higher promotional spending 
product mix was unfavorable as sales volumes shifted to a higher proportion of lower priced grades 
our technical products business net sales increased million  or  primarily due to growth in unit volumes 
the volume growth reflected increased market demand as a result of an improving global economy and new product introductions 
product mix was favorable as sales volumes shifted to a higher proportion of higher priced grades 
our pulp business net sales increased million  or  primarily due to higher softwood pulp prices 
average market prices for softwood and hardwood pulp increased and  respectively 
the higher prices in  particularly for softwood pulp  reflected increased global demand 
net sales subsequent to the spin off in december were reduced by million or of total pulp revenues  reflecting the one time effect of revised sales terms in the new pulp supply agreement with kimberly clark which transfers title at product delivery rather than shipment date 
the following table sets forth line items from our consolidated and combined statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated and is intended to provide a perspective of trends in our historical results year ended december  net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring costs and asset impairment loss other income and expense net operating income loss interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss analysis of operating income loss years ended december   and the following table sets forth our pre tax income loss by segment for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions fine paper technical products pulp unallocated corporate costs total commentary year versus change in operating income versus prior year change due to total change volume net price b material and energy costs c currency other d fine paper technical products pulp a unallocated corporate costs consolidated a the operating loss for our pulp business in and includes restructuring costs and asset impairment losses of million and million  respectively

our operating loss of million in decreased million versus the prior year period 
excluding restructuring costs and asset impairment losses related to our terrace bay mill of million and million  in and  respectively  operating results in the current year were million unfavorable to higher raw material and energy costs  unfavorable currency translation effects related to the strengthening of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar  higher discounts on pulp sales to kimberly clark and costs associated with our operation as a stand alone company were the primary drivers of the unfavorable comparison 
operating income for our fine paper business decreased million primarily due to increased manufacturing and distribution costs and costs associated with our operation as a stand alone company 
the increase in manufacturing costs was primarily due to higher raw material prices including an increase in average hardwood pulp prices  gas prices that increased more than from the prior year and increased costs for chemicals and dyes 
the increase in distribution costs was primarily due to an increase in fuel prices 
in addition  net price was unfavorable to the prior year as an increase in the proportion of unbranded product sales more than offset branded product price increases implemented in december and the third quarter of operating income for our technical products business decreased million due to higher manufacturing costs  costs associated with our operation as a stand alone company and lower average net selling prices  partially offset by favorable volume 
the increase in manufacturing costs was primarily due to higher costs for oil based latex and increased utility costs related to higher coal prices 
net price was unfavorable as higher average prices were more than offset by lower heat transfer shipments and the shift in product mix to selling a higher proportion of relatively lower priced premask and tape products 
volume was favorable to the prior year primarily due to the strong growth in premask sales 
our pulp business incurred an operating loss of million in which was million favorable to the prior year 
operating results for our pulp business were affected by restructuring costs and asset impairment losses related to our terrace bay mill of million and million in and  respectively 
excluding the effect of restructuring activities in both years  our pulp business recorded an operating loss of million in which was unfavorable to the prior year 
the unfavorable comparison to the prior year was primarily due to higher discounts on pulp shipments to kimberly clark pursuant to our pulp supply agreement  unfavorable currency translation effects  increased fiber and energy related manufacturing costs and costs associated with our operation as a stand alone company 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by lower maintenance spending  costs savings related to the closure of the no 
mill and higher average market prices for softwood pulp 
the decrease in maintenance spending was primarily due to reducing scheduled downtime at terrace bay 
restructuring costs and asset impairment losses in december and  we recorded pre tax  non cash impairment losses of approximately million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying amount of the terrace bay facility to its estimated fair value 
deferred tax benefits of approximately million and million were recorded in and  respectively  as a result of the impairment losses  resulting in net after tax charges of approximately million and million 
the cumulative effect of the impairment charges was to reduce the carrying value of the terrace bay facilities tangible long lived assets to zero 
in may  the no 
mill was closed and early retirement and severance packages were offered to approximately employees 
during  we recorded approximately million for one time termination benefits related to early retirement  severance and defined benefit pension plans in connection with the closure of the mill and approximately million for other exit costs 
in addition  we recorded a pre tax  non cash asset impairment loss of approximately million to write off the carrying value of the long lived assets of the no

overall operating income decreased million and we incurred an operating loss of million in primarily due to the impairment loss for terrace bay million pre tax 
our fine paper business operating income increased million primarily due to the higher sales volumes and improved manufacturing operations and the benefits of cost reduction programs 
these gains were partially offset by higher costs for fiber  energy and other materials and a less profitable product mix 
in addition  results in included charges of million for a workforce reduction and million for a write off of a paper machine 
our technical products business operating income increased million  or due to improved manufacturing operations  higher sales volumes and favorable foreign currency effects 
the improved manufacturing costs were due to increased productivity  reduced waste and the benefits of cost reduction programs 
our pulp business operating loss increased million in and we incurred an operating loss of million primarily due to the impairment loss for terrace bay 
higher selling prices of and for softwood and hardwood pulp  respectively  were partially offset by unfavorable currency effects and increased manufacturing costs 
the higher costs resulted from a decrease in the average exchange rate for the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar as well as higher fiber and maintenance costs 
we incurred million of corporate expenses in  including approximately million of one time start up costs relating to our becoming an independent  public company and other post spin off costs to operate as a stand alone company 
there were no comparable costs in additional statement of operations commentary selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended  and we incurred million of expenses in related to our operation as a stand alone company following the spin off  of which million was reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in versus is primarily due to million of one time start up costs related to our becoming an independent  public company and other post spin off costs to operate as a stand alone company 
in  we incurred million of net interest expense including million of amortization of debt issuance costs primarily on our million of senior notes 
in  we incurred million of net interest expense on our million of senior notes for the month of december following the spin off 
kimberly clark used a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations 
as a result  none of kimberly clark s cash  cash equivalents  debt or interest income or expense was allocated to the pulp and paper business for periods prior to the spin off 
the effective tax benefit rate was and for the years and  respectively 
the increase in the benefit rate between and was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of non taxable income items to the pretax loss and generating a higher proportion of the pretax losses in tax jurisdictions with relatively higher marginal tax rates 
the effective tax rate in was 
the change in the effective benefit and tax rates in and  respectively  was primarily due to lower state and local income taxes see note of notes to consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a reconciliation of the annual effective tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in millions net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investment activities financing activities capital expenditures operating cash flow commentary cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  decreased million from this decrease was the result of lower earnings excluding the non cash effects of the terrace bay impairment loss and related deferred tax benefits and depreciation and higher income tax payments  partially offset by a decrease in our investment in operating working capital 
the decrease in operating working capital was primarily due to lower accounts receivable  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable related to the timing of payments following the spin off 
cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  increased million from this increase was the result of increased earnings excluding the non cash effects of the terrace bay impairment loss and related deferred tax benefits and depreciation  partially offset by a smaller decrease in operating working capital than  as discussed below 
during  higher discounts on pulp shipments to kimberly clark and lower pulp volume resulted in lower accounts receivable and reduced our investment in operating working capital excluding the effects of a stronger canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
our reduced investment in operating working capital due to lower accounts receivable was partially offset by an increase of million in inventories excluding the effects of a stronger canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
we built pulp finished good inventories to comply with contractually required safety stock levels as we transition to being a supplier of market pulp 
during  higher average selling prices for pulp resulted in significantly higher accounts receivable and increased our investment in working capital at december  to million 
investing commentary capital spending in of million was million higher than the comparable prior year period 
the increased spending was primarily for the acquisition and installation of enterprise resource planning erp software and leasehold improvements at our new research and development center 
we anticipate capital expenditures for will be approximately to million 
the timing and amount of capital expenditures will depend on the outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities and labor unions  the results of engineering studies and the remediation methods ultimately selected 
these capital expenditures are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
financing commentary our liquidity requirements are being provided by cash generated from operations and short and long term borrowings 
prior to the spin off  our financing net of cash transfers to kimberly clark was provided by kimberly clark 
in  we financed the acquisition of our erp software million through third party financing payable over three years 
we financed our current year insurance premiums million through the issuance of a short term note 
payments under the agreements for our erp software and insurance premiums in the current year were million and million  respectively 
we paid cash dividends of per share or million in management believes that the ability to generate cash from operations and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are adequate to fund working capital  capital spending and other cash needs for the next twelve months 
our ability to generate adequate cash from operations beyond  however  will depend on  among other things  our ability to successfully implement our business strategies and cost cutting initiatives  and to manage the impact of changes in pulp prices and currencies 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement those strategies and cost cutting initiatives  or successfully manage our pulp pricing and currency exposures 
our ability to issue additional stock will be constrained because such an issuance of additional stock may cause the spin off to be taxable to kimberly clark under section e of the internal revenue code  and under the tax sharing agreement  we would be required to indemnify kimberly clark against that tax 
see risk factors risks related to the spin off and our separation from kimberly clark for a more detailed discussion of section e 
contractual obligations the following table presents the total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable as of december  in millions beyond total unconditional purchase obligations long term debt payments interest payments on long term debt other postretirement benefit obligations operating leases open purchase orders contributions to pension trusts total contractual obligations the unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials  primarily wood chips 
although we are primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations  based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows  we believe our exposure to losses  if any  under these arrangements is not material 
the open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts we anticipate will become payable within the next year for goods and services that we have negotiated for delivery 
the above table includes future payments that we will make for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions  including expected future service  to project the future obligations 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and changes in these estimates are recorded when known 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are those that are important both to the presentation of financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments with regard to estimates used 
these critical judgments relate to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements 
we believe that the consistent application of our policies provides readers of neenah s financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when all of the following have occurred delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
the timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded at the time of shipment for terms designated free on board fob shipping point 
with the exception of pulp sales to kimberly clark and certain other customers  our sales terms are fob shipping point 
for pulp sales to kimberly clark and other customers that are designated fob destination  revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer s delivery site 
sales are reported net of allowable discounts and estimated returns 
reserves for cash discounts  trade allowances  credit losses and sales returns are estimated using historical experience 
deferred income tax assets as of december   we have recorded deferred income tax assets totaling million related to temporary differences  and we have established no valuation allowances against these deferred income tax assets 
as of december   our net deferred income tax assets were million 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we consider many factors  including specific taxing jurisdictions  sources of taxable income  income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction 
a valuation allowance would be recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
prior to the spin off  our operations were included in the consolidated income tax returns of kimberly clark 
kimberly clark will indemnify us for all income tax liabilities and retain rights to all tax refunds for periods through the date of the spin off 
accordingly  the consolidated and combined balance sheet for periods prior to the spin off does not include current or prior period income tax receivables or payables related to our operations  which were filed on a consolidated basis with kimberly clark 
for all periods  the income tax provisions have been determined as if we were a separate taxpayer 
financial instruments cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an initial maturity of three months or less 
we place our temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions 
we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and commodity price risks 
we principally use foreign currency forward and pulp future contracts to hedge against these exposures 
derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair market value 
derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges of anticipated future cash flows are marked to market through accumulated other comprehensive income balance sheet adjustments until such time as the related forecasted transactions affect earnings 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through other income 
fair value estimates are based on relevant market information  including current market rates and prices 
the fair value estimates for derivative instruments are provided to us by banks known to be high volume participants in these markets 
we document relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  and link derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions 
we also assess and document  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows associated with the hedged items 
pension benefits in connection with the spin off  and as set forth in the employee matters agreement  obligations for kimberly clark s defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution retirement plans related to active and former employees of the canadian pulp operations and active employees of the us paper operations became our responsibility 
kimberly clark retained the obligations for former employees of the us paper operations 
a share of pension assets related to active employees of the us paper operations were transferred from kimberly clark s pension plan to a new pension plan established by us 
the new plan provides substantially similar benefits and credits our employees for service earned with kimberly clark 
with respect to canadian employees  we assumed the existing pension assets and obligations of the related kimberly clark pension plans 
our funding policy for qualified defined benefit plans is to contribute assets to fully fund the accumulated benefit obligation 
subject to regulatory and tax deductibility limits  any funding shortfall is to be eliminated over a reasonable number of years 
nonqualified plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the taxing authorities are not funded 
consolidated and combined pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  in may we recognized a pre tax charge of million for a partial settlement of certain pension obligations related to the closure of the no 
mill 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense in percents was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets held by our and prior to the spin off  kimberly clark pension trusts was determined based on several factors  including input from pension investment consultants and projected long term returns of broad equity and bond indices 
also considered were the plans historical year and year compounded annual returns 
we anticipate that on average the investment managers for our us and canadian plans will generate annual long term rates of return of at least and  respectively 
our expected long term rate of return on the assets in the plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about with equity managers  with expected long term rates of return of approximately  and with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of about 
the actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
also  when deemed appropriate  hedging strategies are executed using index options and futures to limit the downside exposure of certain investments by trading off upside potential above an acceptable level 
such hedging strategies were executed in  and we evaluate our investment strategy and long term rate of return on pension asset assumptions at least annually 
pension expense is estimated based on the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses calculated value over a period of years 
investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of the assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
the variance between the actual and the expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a calculated value for plan assets was used 
as of december   our plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately million 
these unrecognized net losses may increase our future pension expense if not offset by i actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns  ii other factors  including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate our pension obligations or iii other actuarial gains  including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
the discount or settlement rate that is utilized for determining the present value of future pension obligations generally is based in the us on the yield reported for the long term aa rated corporate bond indexes  converted to an equivalent one year compound basis 
the weighted average discount rate in percents was and at december  and  respectively 
our consolidated pension expense of million in is based on an expected weighted average long term rate of return on assets of  a weighted average discount rate of and various other assumptions 
pension expense beyond will depend on future investment performance  our contributions to the pension trusts  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans 
the fair value of the assets in our defined benefit plans increased to approximately million at december  from about million at december   primarily due to investment gains  plan contributions and currency exchange effects exceeding payments for pension benefits 
lower discount rates caused the projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans to exceed the fair value of plan assets by approximately million at december   compared with approximately million at december  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by about million at the end of at the end of  the fair value of plan assets exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation by about million 
contributions to pension trusts in were million including million for special termination benefits related to the closure of the no 
mill compared with million in in addition  we made direct benefit payments of approximately million in each of  and for unfunded supplemental retirement benefits 
impairment property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pre tax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  growth rates for selling prices and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pre tax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we determine fair value based on an expected present value technique in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational enterprise  we are exposed to risks such as changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and environmental regulation 
a variety of practices are employed to manage these risks  including operating and financing activities and  where deemed appropriate  the use of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments are used only for risk management purposes and not for speculation or trading 
credit risk with respect to the counterparties is considered minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
presented below is a description of our most significant risks 
foreign currency risk our results of operations and cash flows are affected by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations can have a material impact on our financial results because substantially all of our pulp mills expenses are incurred in canadian dollars and our pulp revenues are denominated in us dollars 
in  a hypothetical increase in the canadian dollar relative to the u 
s dollar  would have decreased our income before income taxes by approximately million  excluding additional currency re measurement losses 
we use hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  although these arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
in  we entered into a series of foreign currency forward exchange contracts  designated as cash flow hedges  of u 
s dollar denominated pulp sales 
at december  we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in a notional amount of million canadian dollars 
the fair value of the contracts was million us dollars and was reflected on the balance sheet as an asset 
the weighted average exchange rate for the foreign currency contracts at december  was us dollars per canadian dollar and the contracts extend through may currency transactional exposures are also sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
we performed a sensitivity test to quantify the effects that possible changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar would have on our pre tax income based on the transactional exposure at december  the effect is calculated by multiplying our net monetary asset or liability position by a change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 
as of december   a unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar involving balance sheet transactional exposure would have resulted in a net pre tax loss of approximately million 
finally  the translation of the balance sheets of our canadian operations from canadian dollars into us dollars also is sensitive to changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
consequently  we performed a sensitivity test to determine if changes in the exchange rate would have a significant effect on the translation of the balance sheets of our canadian operations into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded as unrealized translation adjustments  or uta  within stockholders equity 
the hypothetical change in uta is calculated by multiplying the net assets of our canadian operations by a change in the us canadian exchange rate 
the results of this sensitivity test are presented in the following paragraph 
as of december   a unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar would have decreased our stockholders equity by approximately million 
the hypothetical increase in uta is based on the difference between the december  exchange rate and the assumed exchange rate 
commodity risk pulp our results of operations  cash flows and financial position are sensitive to the selling prices of wood pulp 
wood pulp is a commodity for which there are multiple other suppliers 
typically  commodities businesses compete primarily on the basis of price and availability 
the revenues from producing a commodity tend to be cyclical  with periods of shortage and rapidly rising prices leading to increased production and increased industry investment until supply exceeds demand 
those periods are then typically followed by periods of reduced prices and excess and idled capacity until the cycle is repeated 
the markets and profitability of pulp have been  and are likely to continue to be  cyclical 
because our pulp business competes primarily on the basis of price and availability  the financial success of our pulp mills depends on their ability to produce pulp at a competitive cost 
accordingly  we must continuously and effectively manage our cost structure and production capacity to be able to respond effectively to business cycles in the pulp industry 
we use hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to pulp price fluctuations  although these arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
in  we entered into a series of pulp futures contracts to hedge fluctuations in pulp prices through december at december   we had future contracts for  metric tons of pulp with a notional amount of approximately million 
the fair value of the contracts was million and was reflected on the balance sheet as a liability 
the weighted average price for the pulp futures contracts at december  was per metric ton 
based on shipment volume  a per metric ton unfavorable change in the market price for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp excluding the impact of volume and other discounts would reduce pretax income by approximately million 
raw materials we purchase a substantial portion of the raw materials and energy necessary to produce our products on the open market  and  as a result  the price and other terms of those purchases are subject to change based on factors such as worldwide supply and demand and government regulation 
we do not have significant influence over our raw material or energy prices and generally do not possess enough power to pass increases in those prices along to purchasers of our products  unless those increases coincide with increased demand for the product 
therefore  an increase in raw material or energy prices could occur at the same time that prices for our products are decreasing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we obtain most of the wood fiber required for our terrace bay pulp mill and a portion of the wood fiber required for the pictou pulp mill from timberland areas licensed by the ontario and nova scotia provincial governments  respectively 
these governments have granted us non exclusive licenses for substantial timberland areas from which we obtain fiber  and we also obtain fiber harvested from timberland areas licensed to others by these governments 
there can be no assurance that the amount of fiber that we are allowed to harvest from these licensed areas will not be decreased  or that our licenses will continue to be renewed or extended by the governments on acceptable terms 
in each of the areas where our canadian pulp mills are located  there is increasing competition for wood fiber from various other users 
changes in governmental practices and policies as they apply to us and to others from whom we obtain fiber may result in less fiber being available  increased costs to obtain the fiber and additional expense in meeting forestry standards 
these results could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
in  two suppliers provided over of the wood chips used by the pictou mill and three suppliers provided approximately of the wood chips used by the terrace bay mill 
while we believe that alternative sources of critical supplies  such as wood chips  would be available  disruption of our primary sources could create a temporary  adverse effect on product shipments 
also  an interruption in supply of single source specialty grade latex to our technical products business could disrupt and eventually cause a shutdown of production of certain technical products 
we generate substantially all of our electrical energy at the munising and pictou mills and approximately one half of the electrical energy at the terrace bay mill 
availability of energy is not expected to be a problem in the foreseeable future  but the purchase price of such energy can and likely will fluctuate significantly based on fluctuations in demand and other factors 
in addition  we have forward purchase contracts for natural gas through june at december   we had future contracts for  mmbtus of natural gas with a notional amount of approximately million 
the weighted average price for the natural gas futures contracts at december  was per mmbtu 
in january  we entered into an agreement to purchase million tons per year of green steam to supply energy at our neenah paper mill 
we anticipate that the agreement will substantially reduce the mill s annual consumption of natural gas 
there is no assurance that that we will be able to obtain electricity or natural gas purchases on favorable terms in the future 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate long term debt and our variable rate bank debt 
our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows from our variable rate debt and on the market value of our fixed rate debt 
at december   we had million of fixed rate long term debt outstanding and no variable rate borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt resulting from changes in market interest rates  but not to fluctuations in our earnings or cash flows 
at december   the fair market value of our long term debt was million based upon the quoted market price of the senior notes 
a basis point increase in interest rates would not affect our annual interest expense because at december   we had no variable rate borrowings outstanding 
we could in the future  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by entering into interest rate hedging arrangements  although those arrangements could result in us incurring higher costs than we would incur without the arrangements 
environmental regulation our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation by us and canadian authorities 
the company has made significant capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws  rules and regulations 
due to changes in environmental laws and regulations  the application of such regulations and changes in environmental control technology  we are not able to predict with certainty the amount of future capital spending to be incurred for environmental purposes 
taking these uncertainties into account  we anticipate expenditures for major environmental projects during the period through will include approximately million to reconfigure the effluent treatment system at the pictou mill and between million and million for equipment and engineering to abate total sulphur emissions and for other environmental matters at the pictou and terrace bay mills  to remove and replace transformers containing polychlorinated biphenyls at the terrace bay mill  to improve stream crossings in the timberlands licensed from the province of ontario 
we believe that these risks can be managed and will not have a material adverse effect on our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
