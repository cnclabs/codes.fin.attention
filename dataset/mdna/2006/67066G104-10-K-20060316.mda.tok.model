in addition  we are licensing software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities to sce 
sales and marketing our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is a key part of our objective to become the leading supplier of performance gpus  mcps  and handheld gpus for pcs  handheld devices and consumer electronics platforms 
our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industry s respective oems  odms  system integrators  motherboard manufacturers  add in board manufacturers and industry trendsetters  collectively our channel  to define product features  performance  price and timing of new products 
members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support a competitive and complex design win process 
we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist the channel in designing  testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products 
we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving the channel s time to market  maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within the channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products 
in the gpu  mcp  and handheld gpu segments we serve  the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system integrators and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms  motherboard manufacturers and add in board manufacturers 
these design wins in turn influence the retail and system integrator channel that is serviced by add in board and motherboard manufacturers 
our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers  or cems  odms  motherboard manufacturers  add in board manufacturers and distributors each of which has relationships with a broad range of major oems and or strong brand name recognition in the retail channel 
in the handheld gpu segments we serve  the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading handheld oems and supporting the product design into high volume production 
currently  we sell a significant portion of our digital media processors directly to distributors  cems  odms  motherboard manufacturers and add in board manufacturers  which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems  retail outlets and to a large number of system integrators 
although a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue  their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world 
as a result of our channel strategy  our sales are focused on a small number of customers 
sales to edom technology co  ltd  or edom  accounted for and sales to asustek computer inc  or asustek  accounted for of our total revenue for fiscal edom is an independent distributor and asustek is a cem 
to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products  we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community 
engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products  as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems 
our developer program makes products available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products 
backlog our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders 
the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 
in light of industry practice and experience  we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is non cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non cancelable portion is not significant 
we do not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 
seasonality our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market 
due to the seasonality in this market  we typically expect to see stronger revenue performance in the second half of the calendar year related to the back to school and holiday seasons 
manufacturing we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products 
instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all product line operating segments whereby we employ world class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process  including wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and packaging 
this strategy uses the expertise of industry leading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization  or iso  in such areas as fabrication  assembly  quality control and assurance  reliability and testing 
in addition  this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations 
our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products 
as a result  we can focus our resources on product design  additional quality assurance  marketing and customer support 
we utilize industry leading suppliers  such as chartered semiconductor manufacturing  or chartered  semiconductor manufacturing international corporation  or smic  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  or tsmc  and united microelectronics corporation  or umc  to produce our semiconductor wafers 
we then utilize independent subcontractors  such as advanced semiconductor engineering  or ase  amkor technology  king yuan electronics co  ltd  or kyec  siliconware precision industries company ltd  or spil  and stats chippac incorporated to perform assembly  testing and packaging of most of our products 
we typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors  perform incoming quality assurance and then ship them to cems  distributors  motherboard and add in board manufacturer customers from our third party warehouse in hong kong 
generally  these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications  and then ship the products to retailers  system integrators or oems as motherboard and add in board solutions 
inventory and working capital our management focuses considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working capital related items 
we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a product by product basis 
we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on this forecasted demand 
the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability 
we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules 
research and development we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading d graphics  hd video  audio  low power communications  storage  and secure networking performance and features is essential to our future success 
our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus  mcps and handheld gpus using independent design teams 
our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering  hardware engineering  very large scale integration design engineering  process engineering  architecture and algorithms 
these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products 
a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design  or cad  industry 
we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders  including cadence design systems  inc  and synopsys  inc  often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products 
we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next generation development tools to design  simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the d graphics market and develop products that utilize leading edge technology on a rapid basis 
we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oem and other manufacturers 
we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources from fiscal  and have  full time employees engaged in research and development as of january   compared to  employees as of january  during fiscal  and  we incurred research and development expenditures of million  million and million  respectively 
competition the market for gpus  mcps and handheld gpus is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance  breadth of product offerings  access to customers and distribution channels  backward forward software support  conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces  or apis  manufacturing capabilities  price of processors and total system costs of add in boards or motherboards 
we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality 
we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours  or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products 
in addition  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share 
an additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu  mcp  and handheld gpu solutions 
some of our competitors may have greater marketing  financial  distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 
our current competitors include the following suppliers of discrete mcps that incorporate a combination of networking  audio  communications and input output  or i o  functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati technologies  inc  or ati  broadcom corporation  or broadcom  and intel  suppliers of gpus  including mcps that incorporate d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati  intel  matrox electronics systems ltd  silicon integrated systems  inc  via technologies  inc  and xgi technology inc  and suppliers of gpus or gpu intellectual property for handheld and embedded devices that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati  bitboys  broadcom  fujitsu limited  imagination technologies ltd  nec corporation  qualcomm incorporated  renesas technology corp  seiko epson  texas instruments incorporated  and toshiba america  inc we expect substantial competition from intel s publicized focus on moving to selling platform solutions dominated by intel products  such as when intel achieved success with its centrino platform solution 
in addition to its current centrino notebook platform initiative  and its announced upcoming desktop initiative branded as viiv  we expect that intel is now focused on developing and selling platform solutions for all segments including professional workstations and servers 
if intel continues to pursue these initiatives  we may not be able to successfully compete in these segments 
if and to the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise pc  notebook  workstation  pda  cellular phone  and video game console markets  we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete 
we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter 
if we are unable to compete in our current and any new markets  our financial results will suffer 
patents and proprietary rights we rely primarily on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally 
our issued patents have expiration dates from september  to september  we have numerous patents issued and pending in the united states and in foreign countries 
our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products  including our digital media processors 
we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property 
we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regions  the location in which our products are manufactured  our strategic technology or product directions in different countries  and the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions 
our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved 
in addition  any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties 
the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property 
our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 
we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our digital media processors  and expect to continue to enter into license agreements for future products 
these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties  the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration 
if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms  our business could suffer 
employees as of january  we had  employees   of whom were engaged in research and development and  of whom were engaged in sales  marketing  operations and administrative positions 
none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  and we believe our relationships with our employees are good 
financial information by business segment and geographic data our chief executive officer  who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker  or codm  reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we reorganized our operating segments to bring all major product groups in line with our strategy to position ourselves as the worldwide leader in programmable graphics processor technologies 
we now report financial information for four product line operating segments to our codm the gpu business is composed of products that support desktop pcs  notebook pcs and professional workstations  the mcp business is composed of nvidia nforce products that operate as a single chip or chipset that can off load system functions  such as audio processing and network communications  and perform these operations independently from the host cpu  our handheld gpu business is composed of products that support handheld personal digital assistants  cellular phones and other handheld devices  and our consumer electronics business is concentrated in products that support video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices and is composed of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our next generation geforce gpu and sce s system solutions in sce s playstation  revenue from sales of our xbox related products  revenue from our license agreement with microsoft relating to the successor product to their initial xbox gaming console  the xbox  and related devices  and digital media processor products 
in addition to these operating segments  we have the all other category that includes human resources  legal  finance  general administration and corporate marketing expenses  which total million and million for fiscal and  respectively  that we do not allocate to our other operating segments 
all other also includes the results of operations of other miscellaneous operating segments that are neither individually reportable  nor aggregated with another operating segment 
revenue in the all other category is primarily derived from sales of memory 
all prior period amounts have been restated to reflect our new reporting structure 
our codm does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis 
operating segments do not record intersegment revenue  and  accordingly  there is none to be reported 
the accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for nvidia as a whole 
the information included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements is hereby incorporated by reference

item a 
risk factors in evaluating nvidia and our business  the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k 
any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
risks related to our operations because our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors  our failure to forecast any change in such factors could adversely affect our gross margin 
we continue to pursue measures in an effort to improve our gross margin 
our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors  including the mix of our products sold  average selling prices  introduction of new products  sales discounts  unexpected pricing actions by our competitors  the cost of product components  and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products 
if we incorrectly forecast the impact of the aforementioned factors on our business  we may be unable to take action in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin 
in addition  if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts  the trading price of our common stock may decline 
our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete inventory or  conversely  may result in inadequate inventory levels  either of which could adversely affect our financial results 
our inventory purchases are based upon future demand forecasts  which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future 
in forecasting demand  we must make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect 
situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of the value of our inventory and or a forced reduction in average selling prices  and where our gross margin could be adversely affected include if there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  if we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older products as our newer products are introduced  or if our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing actions 
conversely  if we underestimate our customers demand for either our older or newer products  we may have inadequate manufacturing capability and may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers orders on a timely basis  which could affect our revenue results 
even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand  we may not be able to do so in a cost effective manner 
inability to fill our customers orders on a timely basis could damage our customer relationships  result in lost revenue  cause a loss in market share or damage our reputation 
because we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand our ability to reduce our inventory purchase commitments quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls is limited 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
as a result  we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers 
any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business 
in addition  cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory  which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations 
we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth 
additionally  because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter and  therefore  we recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter  we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls 
we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory write downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand  which could negatively impact our gross margin and financial results 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could negatively impact our business 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
none of our executive officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement  meaning our relationships with our executive officers and employees are at will 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers  technical personnel or other key employees  particularly jen hsun huang  our president and chief executive officer  would harm our business 
our success will depend on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business 
the integration of new executives or personnel could disrupt our ongoing operations 
failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and or new products would reduce our gross margin and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design  which is developed largely by us  and process technology  which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process 
resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer 
because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers  any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers 
this could potentially harm customer relationships  our reputation  our revenue and our gross profit 
our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers would reduce our gross margin 
we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process 
a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall could damage our reputation and result in our customers working with our competitors 
to stay competitive  we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated  which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results 
if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts  our operating expenses would increase 
we have substantially increased our engineering and technical resources and have  full time employees engaged in research and development as of january    employees as of january  and  employees as of january  research and development expenditures were million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue  our operating results would decline 
in order to remain competitive  we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development as well as hiring additional employees 
research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed and we may have limited ability to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
our operating expenses  which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales  general and administrative expenses  represented and of our total revenue during fiscal and  respectively 
operating expenses included litigation settlement costs of million in fiscal since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter  we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any revenue shortfalls 
if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls  our financial results would be negatively impacted 
failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could adversely affect our operating results and gross margin 
our strategy is to utilize the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third party foundries 
use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems and higher product cost 
manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development 
we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs 
we currently use micron  micron  micron  micron  and nanometer process technologies for our families of gpus  mcps and handheld gpus 
we have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes 
moreover  we are dependent on our relationships with our third party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
the inability by us or our third party manufacturers to effectively and efficiently transition to new manufacturing process technologies may adversely affect our operating results and our gross margin 
our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate  and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our stock could decline 
many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict  and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period 
it is  therefore  difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses 
as a result  it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  perhaps substantially 
we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue  gross profit and results of operations 
any one or more of the factors discussed in this annual report on form k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year 
risks related to our products if we are unable to achieve design wins  our products may not be adopted by our target markets and customers either of which could negatively impact our financial results 
the future success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to develop new competitive products for our target markets and customers 
we believe achieving design wins  which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by pc oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers  will aid our future success 
our oem  odm  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year  typically based on spring and fall design cycles 
accordingly  when our customers are making their design decisions  our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in new system configurations 
this requires that we do the following anticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand  incorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers  price our products competitively  and introduce products to the market within the limited design cycle for oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers 
if oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems  they will typically not use our products in their design systems until at least the next design configuration 
therefore  we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to allow us to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that our products will achieve design wins 
our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards 
unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers  including amd  intel and microsoft 
such changes would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time  our ability to achieve design wins could suffer 
if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers  we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impacted 
achievement of design wins may not result in the success of our products and could result in a loss of market share 
the process of being qualified for inclusion in an oem product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature  which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business 
even if we do have design wins for oem and odm products  we may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the oem  odm  add in board and motherboard manufacturers design cycles as well as other market demand 
additionally  even if we achieve a significant number of design wins  there can be no assurance that our oem and odm customers will actually take the design to production or that the design will be commercially successful 
furthermore  there may be changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers products that could negatively impact the success of our products 
any of these factors could result in a loss of market share and could negatively impact our financial results 
our business results could be adversely affected if our product development efforts are unsuccessful 
we have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products 
any delay in the future or failure of our gpus or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business 
the success of our new product introductions will depend on many factors  including the following proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  the ability of third party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our new products in a timely manner  dependence on third party subcontractors for assembly  testing and packaging of our products and in meeting product delivery schedules and maintaining product quality  the quality of any new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  and availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory products 
a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computer aided design  or cad  industry 
we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with industry leaders  including cadence design systems  inc and synopsys  inc  often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products 
we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing next generation development tools to design  simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the d graphics  communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leading edge technology on a rapid basis 
we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers 
if these relationships are not successful  we may not be able to develop new products in a timely manner  which could result in a loss of market share  a decrease in revenue and a negative impact on our operating results 
our failure to successfully develop  introduce or achieve market acceptance for new processors would harm our business 
our failure to identify new market or product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business 
as our gpus or other processors develop and competition increases  we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will decline 
in particular  we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases 
as a result  we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain or improve overall average selling prices and gross margins 
in order for our processors to achieve high volumes  leading pc oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our processor for design into their products  and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them 
we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market new products in a timely fashion 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems  odms  and add in board and motherboard manufacturers products  that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold 
as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for our products increases  there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of our products and that there will be delays in the development  introduction or volume shipment of our products 
we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors that may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we develop 
in addition  we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products 
failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices  reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share 
in addition  technologies developed by others may render our processors non competitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory  any of which would harm our business 
we could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects 
products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or experience failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released 
we have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers hardware in some of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any defects or incompatibilities in the future 
errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins 
our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution 
as a result  our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution 
if these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution  we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field 
we may also be required to incur additional research and development costs to find and correct the defect  which could divert the attention of our management and engineers from the development of new products 
these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we may also suffer a loss of reputation and or a loss in our market share  either of which could materially harm our financial results 
risks related to our partners and customers there can be no assurance that the playstation will achieve long term commercial success 
in april  we finalized our definitive agreement with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our next generation geforce gpu and sce s system solutions in sce s playstation our collaboration with sce includes license fees and royalties for the playstation and all derivatives  including next generation digital consumer electronics devices 
in addition  we are licensing software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities to sce 
during fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our next generation geforce gpu and sce s system solutions in sce s playstation depending on the ultimate success of this next generation platform  we expect to generate  starting in fiscal  revenue ranging from million to million annually from license fees and royalties over the next five years  with the possibility of additional royalties for several years thereafter 
there can be no assurance that the playstation will achieve long term commercial success  given the intense competition in the game console market 
additionally  we do not have control over the launch date or pricing of the playstation as such  we do not have control over when we will receive royalties 
if we do not receive royalties as we anticipate  our revenue and gross margin may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions  which could hurt our ability to grow our business  develop new products or sell our products 
in the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products  services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels 
we may enter into future acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses  in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market 
for example  in february we completed the acquisition of uli electronics  inc  or uli  a leading developer of core logic technology  for approximately million paid in cash 
if we do consider an acquisition  strategic alliance or joint venture  the negotiations could divert management s attention as well as other resources 
for any previous or future acquisition or investment  including uli  the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products  and ultimately  could impair our ability to sell our products  which could negatively impact our growth or our financial results difficulty in combining the technology  products  operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business  disruption of our ongoing businesses difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  diversion of management s attention from our business  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  disruption of or delays in ongoing research and development efforts  diversion of capital and other resources  assumption of liabilities  diversion of resources and unanticipated expenses resulting from litigation arising from potential or actual business acquisitions or investments  difficulties in entering into new markets in which we have limited or no experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger positions  and impairment of relationships with employees and customers  or the loss of any of our key employees or of our target s key employees  as a result of the integration of new businesses and management personnel 
in addition  the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash  convertible debt and common stock 
if we pay all or a portion of the purchase price in cash  our cash reserves would be reduced 
if the consideration is paid with shares of our common stock  or convertible debentures  the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted 
we cannot forecast the number  timing or size of future acquisitions  or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operations or financial results 
we sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer by the loss of any of these customers 
we have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated 
sales to our two largest customers accounted for approximately   and of our revenue during fiscal  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of fiscal  microsoft indicated that it would not order any more xbox related products from us after our second fiscal quarter 
as a result  the second quarter of fiscal was the last quarter during which we recognized revenue from the sale of our xbox related products to microsoft 
although a small number of our other customers represents the majority of our revenue  their end customers include a large number of oems and system integrators throughout the world who  in many cases  specify the graphics supplier 
our sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading pc oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key cems  odms  motherboard and add in board manufacturers 
these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by cems  odms  motherboard and add in board manufacturers 
our distribution strategy is to work with a small number of leading independent cems  odms  motherboard manufacturers  add in board manufacturers and distributors  each of which has relationships with a broad range of system builders and leading pc oems 
if we were to lose sales to our pc oems  cems  odms  motherboard and add in board manufacturers and were unable to replace the lost sales with sales to different customers  or if they were to significantly reduce the number of products they order from us  our revenue may not reach or exceed the expected level in any period  which could harm our financial condition and our results of operations 
we depend on foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which would harm our business 
we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
our products require wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and techniques 
we utilize industry leading suppliers  such as chartered  smic  tsmc  and umc to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent subcontractors to perform assembly  testing and packaging 
we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs  to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields  and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis at acceptable prices 
these manufacturers may be unable to meet our near term or long term manufacturing or pricing requirements 
we obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis 
the foundries we use have no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product 
suppliers  such as chartered  smic  tsmc  and umc  fabricate wafers for other companies  including some of our competitors  and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users  reduce or eliminate deliveries to us  or increase the prices that they charge us on short notice 
if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries  we could lose sales to customers  which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation 
because the lead time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters  there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product 
in addition  the time and effort to qualify a new foundry could result in additional expense  diversion of resources or lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results 
we believe that long term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with third party manufacturers we may use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing so that we are able to respond to customer demand 
we are dependent on third parties located outside of the united states for assembly  testing and packaging of our products  which reduces our control over the delivery and quantity of our products 
our processors are assembled and tested by independent subcontractors  such as ase  amkor technology inc  kyec  spil  and stats chippac incorporated  all of which are located outside of the united states 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors 
as a result of our dependence on third party subcontractors for assembly  testing and packaging of our products  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
demand for qualified independent subcontractors to assemble and test products is high 
if demand for these subcontractors exceeds the number of qualified subcontractors  we may experience capacity constraints  which could result in product shortages  a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost 
any of our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of one of our competitors over our orders 
any product shortages  quality assurance problems or political instability outside of the united states could increase the costs of manufacture  assembly or testing of our products  which could cause our gross margin to decline 
due to the amount of time typically required to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components 
any such delays could result in a loss of reputation or a decrease in sales to our customers 
we rely on third party vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products 
in the design and development of new products and product enhancements  we rely on third party software development tools 
while we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools  some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future 
for example  we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products 
the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from processors in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools that are available to us 
if the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands  our business could suffer 
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income and the deferral of revenue recognition from sales to affected customers  which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry 
in addition  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable or the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure 
in addition  we purchase credit insurance on selected customers accounts receivable balances in an effort to further mitigate our exposure for such losses 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we may have to record additional reserves or write offs and or defer revenue on certain sales transactions in the future  which could negatively impact our financial results 
risks related to our competition the market for gpu  mcp  and handheld gpus is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete 
the market for gpus  mcps and handheld gpus is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance  breadth of product offerings  access to customers and distribution channels  backward forward software support  conformity to industry standard apis  manufacturing capabilities  price of processors and total system costs of add in boards and motherboards 
we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality 
we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours  or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products  which could harm our business 
an additional significant source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide gpu  mcp  and handheld gpu solutions 
some of our competitors may have or be able to obtain greater marketing  financial  distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes 
our current competitors include the following suppliers of discrete mcps that incorporate a combination of networking  audio  communications and input output  or i o  functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati technologies  inc  or ati  broadcom corporation  or broadcom  and intel  suppliers of gpus  including mcps that incorporate d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati  intel  matrox electronics systems ltd  silicon integrated systems  inc  via technologies  inc  and xgi technology inc  and suppliers of gpus or gpu intellectual property for handheld and embedded devices that incorporate advanced graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati  bitboys  broadcom  fujitsu limited  imagination technologies ltd  nec corporation  qualcomm incorporated  renesas technology corp  seiko epson  texas instruments incorporated  and toshiba america  inc if and to the extent we offer products outside of the consumer and enterprise pc  notebook  workstation  pda  cellular phone  and video game console markets  we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete 
we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter 
if we are unable to compete in our current and any new markets  our financial results will suffer 
as intel continues to pursue platform solutions  we may not be able to successfully compete 
we expect substantial competition from intel s publicized focus on moving to selling platform solutions dominated by intel products  such as when intel achieved success with its centrino platform solution 
in addition to its current centrino notebook platform initiative  and its announced upcoming desktop initiative branded as viiv  we expect that intel is now focused on developing and selling platform solutions for all segments including professional workstations and servers 
if intel continues to pursue these initiatives  we may not be able to successfully compete in these segments 
risks related to market conditions we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 
a significant portion of our semiconductor wafers are manufactured  assembled  tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states 
additionally  we generated  and of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas for fiscal  and  respectively 
the manufacture  assembly  test and packaging of our products outside of the united states and sales to these customers outside of the united states and other americas subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states and other americas  including  but not limited to international economic and political conditions  unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  labor issues in foreign countries  cultural differences in the conduct of business  inadequate local infrastructure  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  transportation delays  longer payment cycles  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  imposition of additional taxes and penalties  different legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond our control  including terrorism  civil unrest  war and diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and the avian flu 
if sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors  our revenue may be negatively impacted 
we have offices outside of the united states  including offices in taiwan  japan  korea  china  hong kong  india  france  russia  germany and england 
during fiscal  we substantially increased our international employee resources from employees as of january  to full time employees as of january  on february   we completed the acquisition of uli  a leading developer of core logic technology  which added approximately to employees to our international operations 
our operations in our international locations are subject to many of the risks contained in the above list 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations and to open other international offices 
difficulties with our international operations  including finding appropriate staffing and office space  may divert management s attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results 
currently  all of our arrangements with third party manufacturers and subcontractors provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars as are sales to our customers located outside of the united states and other americas 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which would negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
to date  we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
we are dependent on the pc market and the rate of its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 
we derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets  including professional workstations 
we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets in the next several years 
a reduction in sales of pcs  or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales  will reduce demand for our products 
moreover  changes in demand could be large and sudden 
since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions 
in these cases  pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed  which would have a negative impact on our business 
if our products do not continue to be accepted by the consumer and enterprise pc  notebook  workstation  pda  cellular phone  and video game console markets or if the demand in these markets for new and innovative products decreases  our business and operating results would suffer 
our success depends in part upon continued broad adoption of our processors for d graphics in consumer and enterprise pc  notebook  workstation  pda  cellular phone  and video game console applications 
the market for processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products  often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results  changes in pricing of dynamic random access memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of add in boards  as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions 
only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance  if achieved  is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions 
since the gpu business is our core business  our financial results would suffer if for any reason our current or future gpus do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the pc market 
if we are unable to complete the timely development of products or if we were unable to successfully and cost effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the consumer and enterprise pc  notebook  and workstation markets  we may experience a decrease in revenue which could negatively impact our operating results 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards  features or performance 
if our customers and the market do not continue to demand new products with increased performance  features  functionality or standards  sales of our products could decline 
our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences  including fines  suspension of production  excess inventory  sales limitations  and criminal and civil liabilities 
we may be subject to various state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment  including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection  treatment  recycling and disposal of those products 
for example  the semiconductor industry is moving towards becoming compliant with the restriction of hazardous substances directive  or rohs directive  which will become effective in july the rohs directive is european legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances  including lead 
similarly  the state of california has adopted certain restrictions  which go into effect in  that restrict the use of certain materials in electronic products  that are intended to harmonize with the rohs directive and other states are contemplating similar legislation 
china has promulgated use restrictions on the same substances as the rohs directive  but has not yet defined either the scope of the affected products or an effective date of any such restrictions 
also  we could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive  or weee 
the weee directs members of the european union to enact laws  regulations  and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electric and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection  recycling  treatment and environmentally responsible disposal of certain products sold into the market after august  and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced 
we continue to evaluate the impact of specific registration and compliance activities required by weee 
it is possible that unanticipated supply shortages  delays or excess non compliant inventory may occur as a result of such regulations 
failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines  suspension of production  excess inventory  sales limitations  and criminal and civil liabilities 
hostilities involving the united states and or terrorist attacks could harm our business 
the financial  political  economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks on the united states in led to a weakening of the global economy 
similar terrorist acts and or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states and iraq or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers  distributors and suppliers  which could also adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our business is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our financial results 
our business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  including alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints  variations in manufacturing costs and yields  significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development and rapid technological change 
if we are unable to respond to changes in our industry  which can be unpredictable and rapid  in an efficient and timely manner  our operating results could suffer 
in particular  from time to time  the semiconductor industry has experienced significant and sometimes prolonged downturns characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
if we cannot take appropriate actions such as reducing our manufacturing or operating costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand during a downturn  our revenue and earnings will suffer 
political instability in taiwan and in the people s republic of china or elsewhere could harm our business 
because of our reliance on foundries and independent contractors located in taiwan and the people s republic of china  and because we have offices in these locations  our business may be harmed by political instability in taiwan  including the worsening of the strained relations between the people s republic of china and taiwan 
also if relations between the united states and the people s republic of china are strained due to foreign relations events 
if any of our suppliers experienced a substantial disruption in their operations  as a result of a natural disaster  political unrest  economic instability  acts of terrorism or war  equipment failure or other cause  it could harm our business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 
we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because our debt securities are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
risks related to government action  regulatory action  intellectual property  and litigation expensing employee stock options in future periods will materially and aversely affect our reported operating results and could adversely affect our competitive position as well 
since inception  we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our compensation packages 
to date we generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold pursuant to our employee stock purchase program 
we believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and  through the use of vesting  encourage our employees to remain with us 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based compensation payments 
in april  the sec delayed the effective date of sfas no 
r  which is now effective for annual periods that begin after june  sfas no 
r requires that we record compensation expense for stock options and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards 
expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stock based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings 
we anticipate that our stock based compensation expense will be approximately to million for the first quarter of fiscal and we are unsure how the market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results  which could impact our stock price 
to the extent that sfas no 
r makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program  we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs 
in addition  actions that we may take to reduce stock based compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement may make it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 
we are currently involved in patent litigation  which  if not resolved favorably  could require us to pay damages 
we are currently involved in patent litigation 
on october   opti incorporated  or opti  filed a complaint for patent infringement against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
opti asserts that unspecified nvidia chipsets infringe five united states patents held by opti 
opti seeks unspecified damages for our alleged conduct  attorneys fees and triple damages because of our alleged willful infringement of these patents 
nvidia filed a response to this complaint in december after a case management conference in july  discovery began and a trial date has now been set for july a court mandated mediation was held in january and did not resolve the matter 
we believe the claims asserted against us are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
in august  a texas limited partnership named american video graphics  lp  or avg  filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various corporate defendants  not including nvidia  in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
avg initially asserted that each of the approximately thirty defendants sells products that infringe one or more of seven separate patents that avg claims relate generally to graphics processing functionality 
in november  nvidia sought and was granted permission to intervene in two of the three pending avg lawsuits 
our complaint in intervention alleged that both of the patents in suit were invalid and that  to the extent avg s claims target nvidia products  the asserted patents were not infringed 
on december   avg and substantially all of the named defendants and intervenors  including nvidia  settled all of pending claims  the only surviving claims will relate solely to two non settling defendants 
as part of the settlement  the defendants and intervenors paid an undisclosed aggregate amount to avg 
in exchange  all pending claims between the settling parties were dismissed with prejudice  and avg granted to all settling parties a full release of all claims for past damages and a full license for all future sales of accused products under all of avg s patents  including the patents in suit 
in addition  as part of the settlement  all settling defendants and intervenors fully and finally waived any claims for indemnification they may have had against any other settling party 
our defenses against opti may be unsuccessful 
if this case goes forward  or if other patent litigation matters involving us arise  we expect that they will result in additional legal and other costs  such as those costs associated with the avg suit  regardless of the outcome  which could be substantial 
our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions which could result in significant expense 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions  which have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation 
the graphics processor industry  in particular  has been recently characterized by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions  and we expect our competitors and others will continue to aggressively pursue intellectual property positions 
the technology that we use to design and develop our products and that is incorporated into our products may be subject to claims that it infringes the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
our success is dependent on our ability to develop new products without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others or by licensing the intellectual property of third parties 
as such  we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation into our products  and expect to continue to enter into license agreements with third parties for future products 
these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties  the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration 
if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  our competitive position and our business could suffer 
our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally 
we have numerous patents issued  allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign countries 
our patents and pending patent applications relate to technology used by us in connection with our products  including our processors 
we also rely on international treaties and organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property 
the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as by the laws of the united states 
this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely 
we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regions  location in which our products are manufactured  our strategic technology or product directions in different countries  and degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions 
our pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved 
in addition  any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties 
the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property 
our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business 
litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to us 
from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we expect that  as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases  and as competition in our product lines intensifies  the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase 
we may become involved in future lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or by our customers that we have agreed to indemnify them for certain claims of infringement arising out of the sale of our products to these customers 
in addition  litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  enforce our patents protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the propriety rights of others 
if infringement claims are made against us  we may seek licenses under the claimants patents or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  we or an indemnified customer may be required to obtain a license to a third parties patents or intellectual property 
however  licenses may not be offered to us at all or on terms acceptable to us  particularly by competitors 
if we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products used by an indemnified customer  we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products either of which could reduce our revenue and harm our business 
furthermore  the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results 
alternatively  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights  which could be costly 
if we have to initiate a claim  our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results 
additionally  if one of our patents is invalidated or found to be unenforceable  we would be unable to license the patent which could result in a loss of revenue 
regardless of the outcome  litigation or negotiations involving intellectual property rights can be very costly and can divert management s attention from other matters 
we may be unsuccessful in defending or pursuing these lawsuits or claims 
an unfavorable ruling could include significant damages  invalidation of a patent or family of patents  indemnification of customers  payment of lost profits  or  when it has been sought  injunctive relief 
our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities 
we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world 
tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  changes in available tax credits  changes in share based compensation expense  changes in tax laws  the interpretation of tax laws either in the united states or abroad or the issuance of new interpretative accounting guidance related to uncertain transactions and calculations where the tax treatment was previously uncertain  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above  our operating results could be adversely affected 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are exposed to risks from legislation requiring companies to evaluate those internal controls 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements 
this legislation is relatively new and neither companies nor accounting firms have significant experience in complying with its requirements 
as a result  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section compliance 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section  investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may continue to experience significant short term fluctuations 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe 
we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue  gross profit and results of operations  any of which could impact our stock price 
additionally  the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are non company specific  such as the decline in the united states and or international economies  acts of terror against the united states  war or due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue  gross margin or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed in these risk factors 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these provisions include the following the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval  the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent  a classified board of directors  and advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals 
on march   we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox 
under the agreement  if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock 
the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia

item legal proceedings dfx on december   nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an agreement to purchase certain graphics chip assets from dfx 
the dfx asset purchase closed on april  in may  we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of dfx s san jose  california commercial real estate lease 
in december  we were served with a california state court complaint filed by the landlord of dfx s austin  texas commercial real estate lease 
the landlords complaints both assert claims for  among other things  interference with contract  successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seek to recover  among other things  amounts owed on their leases with dfx in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
in october  dfx filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california 
the landlords actions were subsequently removed to the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california and consolidated with a complaint filed by the trustee in the dfx bankruptcy case for purposes of discovery 
upon motion by nvidia in  the district court withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court and the landlord actions were removed to the united states district court for the northern district of california 
on november   the district court granted nvidia s motion to dismiss the landlords respective amended complaints and allowed the landlords to have until february  to amend their complaints 
the landlords refiled claims against nvidia in early february  and nvidia again requested the district court to dismiss all such claims made by the landlords 
a hearing on nvidia s new motions to dismiss is set for hearing on april  discovery is stayed pending this hearing and no trial date has been set in these actions 
we believe the claims asserted against us by the landlords are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
in march  we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent the interests of the dfx bankruptcy estate 
the trustee s complaint asserts claims for  among other things  successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeks additional payments from us 
on october   the court held a hearing on the trustee s motion for summary adjudication 
on december   the court issued its ruling denying the trustee s motion for summary adjudication in all material respects and holding that nvidia is prevented from disputing that the value of the dfx transaction to nvidia was less than million 
the court expressly denied the trustee s request to find that the value of the dfx assets conveyed to nvidia were at least million 
in early november  after many months of mediation  nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors  or the creditors committee  reached a conditional settlement of the trustee s claims against nvidia 
this conditional settlement  presented as the centerpiece of a proposed plan of liquidation in the bankruptcy case  is subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court after notice and hearing 
the scope and schedule for that confirmation process has yet to be determined  but we expect that hearing to now occur sometime in the next few months 
the trustee has advised that he intends to object to the settlement 
the settlement with the creditors committee calls for a payment of approximately million to the dfx estate 
under the settlement  million relates to various administrative expenses and trustee fees  and million relates to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of dfx 
as such  during the three month period ended october   we recorded million as a charge to settlement costs and million as additional purchase price for dfx 
the bankruptcy court  over objection of the creditors committee and nvidia  has ordered the discovery portion of the litigation to proceed while the settlement is pending approval through the confirmation process 
however  no trial date has been set in the trustee s action 
in addition  following the trustee s filing of a form k on behalf of dfx  in which the trustee disclosed the terms of the proposed settlement agreement between nvidia and the creditor s committee  certain shareholders of dfx filed a petition with the bankruptcy court to appoint an official committee to represent the claimed interest s of dfx shareholders 
that petition was granted and an equity holder s committee was appointed 
counsel for the equity holder s committee has announced an intention to file a competing plan of reorganization or liquidation in the trustee s case 
opti incorporated on october   opti incorporated  or opti  filed a complaint for patent infringement against nvidia in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
opti asserts that unspecified nvidia chipsets infringe five us patents held by opti 
opti seeks unspecified damages for our alleged conduct  attorneys fees and triple damages for alleged willful infringement by nvidia 
nvidia filed a response to this complaint in december a case management conference was held in july where a trial date was set for july a court mandated mediation was held in january and did not resolve the matter 
discovery continues  as well as preparation for the markman hearing on claim construction 
the markman hearing is scheduled for april  we believe the claims asserted against us are without merit and we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
we do not have sufficient information to determine whether a loss is probable 
as such  we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements for such  if any  loss 
american video graphics in august  a texas limited partnership named american video graphics  lp  or avg  filed three separate complaints for patent infringement against various corporate defendants  not including nvidia  in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas

in addition  as part of the settlement  all settling defendants and intervenors fully and finally waived any claims for indemnification they may have had against any other settling party 
we are subject to other legal proceedings  but we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations 
however  if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period

in june  we launched and shipped our second generation shader model gpu  the geforce gtx  which is designed to address the high end enthusiast desktop pc segment 
in august  we launched and shipped our second geforce gpu  the geforce gt  which is designed to address the high end performance desktop pc segment 
in june  we made our sli technology available to users in the mainstream segment with the release of our geforce in july  we introduced two new nvidia quadro gpus  the nvidia quadro fx and the nvidia quadro fx  which are designed for the high end and mainstream professional segments  respectively 
both products support our sli technology 
in september  we launched and shipped the new nvidia geforce go gtx  the flagship of the nvidia notebook gpu product line 
in october  we announced that we will be the exclusive provider of all graphics cards offered on the first peripheral component interconnect  or pci  express platform from apple computer  inc  or apple 
in addition  the first ever apple power mac will incorporate our nvidia quadro professional class gpu 
in november  we introduced and shipped the nvidia geforce gtx gpu  which contains over million transistors and is the industry s only mainstream gpu to incorporate bit hdr 
we also announced the immediate availability of the nvidia geforce gs gpu  which is designed for the mainstream segment 
in january  we shipped the geforce gs  our first mainstream version of the geforce series 
we also introduced three new notebook gpus the geforce go  geforce go and geforce go all based on our second generation shader model architecture and designed to deliver cutting edge d  high definition  or hd  home theatre quality video and advanced power management to the notebook market 
the combination of our geforce and geforce series of gpus and our sli technology has created a new class of gaming pcs and professional workstations 
sli technology takes advantage of the increased bandwidth of the pci express bus architecture to allow two nvidia based graphics cards to operate in a single pc or professional workstation 
more than million motherboards incorporating sli technology and million gpus incorporating sli technology have shipped to date 
in the upcoming fiscal year  we expect additional growth in our gpu business 
we believe that sales of our desktop gpu products will be increased by share gains from our anticipated position in the market  microsoft windows vista  or vista  the introduction of hd and blu ray video 
we expect to extend our technology and performance leadership 
the geforce and geforce series of desktop and notebook gpus are designed to be compatible with vista  which is scheduled to be released in the second half of calendar we believe that in the upcoming year there will be increased demand for hd video  and that sony playstation will be a key driver of demand for hd and blu ray video 
we expect hd and blu ray video to promote increased demand for the video processing capabilities of our next generation gpus 
mcp business in april  we announced the availability of our nvidia nforce sli intel corporation  or intel  edition mcp for intel platforms 
this line of core logic solutions incorporates a host of new and innovative features that have never before been available on the intel platform and extends the nvidia nforce brand into new segments 
in addition  during the first quarter of fiscal  we shipped the nvidia nforce professional mcp in its first enterprise server platform 
in august  we announced that the nvidia nforce sli x intel edition technology featured in the dell dimension xps desktop pc was immediately available 
in september  we introduced and shipped the nvidia nforce mcp and geforce integrated gpu family 
this represents the first integrated gpu solution to support directx shader model technology 
we expect this integrated solution to be an important new growth factor for our gpu and mcp businesses 
in december  we announced our intent to acquire uli electronics  inc  or uli  one of the pc industry s most highly regarded core logic developers 
on february   we completed the acquisition of uli 
the acquisition represents our ongoing investment in uli s platform solution strategy and is expected to strengthen our sales  marketing  and customer engineering presence in taiwan and china 
in january  we shipped the nvidia nforce sli xe and nvidia nforce ultra intel mcps 
these products represent our first discrete chipsets targeted at mainstream intel based motherboards 
our nvidia nforce product line has achieved record revenue for six consecutive quarters 
we believe that advanced micro devices transition to k  our extension into new segments  and our entry into the intel market with our first ever mainstream intel nforce mcps will make our mcp business one of our fastest growing businesses 
furthermore  we believe that our ability to simultaneously innovate using our gpu  mcp  and software knowledge base will allow us to make additional platform innovations in the future 
handheld gpu business our strategy in the handheld gpu business is to lead innovation and capitalize on the emergence of the mobile phone as a versatile consumer lifestyle device 
our initial focus was on g cellular phones 
through the first half of fiscal  our handheld gpu business was heavily concentrated at one original equipment manufacturer  or oem  and its products did not achieve the anticipated level of commercial success 
however  during the third quarter of fiscal  motorola inc and sony ericsson mobile communications ab launched g models of their razr and walkman portable phones  respectively  that are both powered by our goforce gpus 
our goforce handheld gpus are now shipping in the new motorola g razr vx and the new sony ericsson walkman phones 
our strategy is to build a new class of low power gpus for multimedia rich devices like g cell phones  smart phones  and portable media players 
we believe that there will be an increase in demand for mobile video products that deliver compelling and tangible improvements to the overall end user experience of these new services  and we believe that we are well positioned to increase our share of the handheld segment in the upcoming year 
consumer electronics business in april  we finalized our definitive agreement with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our next generation geforce gpu and sce s system solutions in sce s playstation our collaboration with sce includes license fees and royalties for the playstation and all derivatives  including next generation digital consumer electronics devices 
in addition  we are licensing software development tools for creating shaders and advanced graphics capabilities to sce 
during fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our next generation geforce gpu and sce s system solutions in sce s playstation depending on the ultimate success of this next generation platform  we expect to generate  starting in fiscal  revenue ranging from million to million annually from license fees and royalties over the next five years with the possibility of additional royalties for several years thereafter 
we have successfully reached many development milestones and we believe that we are on target to achieve the goals set by sce 
during the first quarter of fiscal  microsoft indicated that it would not order any more xbox related products from us after our second fiscal quarter 
as a result  the second quarter of fiscal was the last quarter during which we recognized revenue from the sale of our xbox related products to microsoft 
gross margin improvement we continue to remain intensely focused on improving our gross margin 
beginning in fiscal  we implemented profit improvement initiatives across our company which were designed to improve business and operational processes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our gross margin was  which represents an increase of basis points from our gross margin of for the fourth quarter of fiscal our gross margin was for fiscal  which represents an increase of basis points from our gross margin of for fiscal we believe that we can continue to improve our gross margin during fiscal share based payment since inception  we have used stock options and our employee stock purchase program as fundamental components of our employee compensation packages 
to date we generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options or shares sold pursuant to our employee stock purchase program 
we believe that these incentives directly motivate our employees and  through the use of vesting  encourage our employees to remain with us 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based compensation payments 
in april  the sec delayed the effective date of sfas no 
r  which is now effective for annual periods that begin after june  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab no 
 which includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition 
we intend to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stock based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings 
we anticipate that our stock based compensation expense will be approximately to million for the first quarter of fiscal and we are unsure how the market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results  which could impact our stock price 
to the extent that sfas no 
r makes it more expensive to grant stock options or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program  we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs 
in addition  actions that we may take to reduce stock based compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement may make it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results 
repatriation legislation the american jobs creation act of  or act  was signed into law on october  the act provided a temporary incentive for united states multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the united states at a federal effective tax rate of 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repatriated million in foreign earnings under the act 
the net tax effect of this distribution was minimal because the current tax cost at a tax rate was offset by the benefit attributable to reducing our deferred tax liability for taxes on earnings previously provided at the statutory rate of 
subsequent events uli electronics  inc on february   we completed the acquisition of uli electronics  inc  a leading developer of core logic technology  for approximately million paid in cash 
stock split 
on march   we issued a press release announcing that our board of directors approved a two for one stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock split will be effective on or about thursday  april  for stockholders of record at the close of business on friday  march  and will entitle each stockholder to receive one additional share for every outstanding share of common stock held 
upon the completion of the stock split  nvidia will have approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
stock repurchase 
on march   we also announced that our board of directors approved an increase in our existing stock repurchase program 
we announced a million increase to the original stock repurchase program we had announced in august as a result of this increase  the amount of common stock the board of directors has authorized to be repurchased has now been increased to a total of million 
the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions  or in structured stock repurchase transactions  in compliance with the securities and exchange commission rule b  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  cost of revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  and goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 
revenue recognition product revenue we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
for most sales  we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the point of sale  we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
our policy on sales to distributors is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized 
our customer programs primarily involve rebates  which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets 
we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  or eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products and  as such  we accrue for of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor 
unclaimed rebates  which historically have not been significant  are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate 
rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds  or mdfs 
we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with eitf mdfs represent monies paid to retailers  system builders  oems  distributors and add in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products 
if market conditions decline  we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized  based primarily on historical return rates 
however  if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 
license and development revenue for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components  we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed 
for all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate 
a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  we have not recorded any such losses 
costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts 
if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized  the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management determines this allowance  which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure 
our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers  the financial institutions providing letters of credit  or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future 
our current credit insurance agreement expires on december  as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and our gross accounts receivable balance was million 
of the million  million was covered by credit insurance and million was covered by letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or write offs on certain sales transactions in the future 
as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between and during fiscal and factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables  the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented of our gross accounts receivable balance 
if our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable would have been recorded at of our gross accounts receivable balance  then our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable balance at january  would have been approximately million  rather than the actual balance of million 
inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or first in  first out basis 
we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market  obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  future product purchase commitments  estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products  additional future inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin 
as of january   our inventory reserve was million 
as a percentage of our gross inventory balance  our inventory reserve has ranged between and during fiscal and as of january   our inventory reserve represented of our gross inventory balance 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities  as appropriate  for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based  in part  on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome  changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states  or foreign jurisdictions where we operate  or changes in other facts or circumstances 
in addition  we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment  we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements  accordingly 
as of january   we had a valuation allowance of million 
of the total valuation allowance  million is attributable to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
the tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  if and when realized  will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity 
of the remaining valuation allowance at january   million relates to federal and state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due  in part  to potential utilization limitations as a result of ownership changes  and million relates to certain state deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due  in part  to projections of future taxable income 
to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes probable  recognition of these tax benefits would first reduce goodwill to zero  then reduce other non current intangible assets related to the acquisition to zero with any remaining benefit reported as a reduction to income tax expense 
to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain state tax benefits becomes probable  we would recognize an income tax benefit in the period such asset is more likely than not to be realized 
goodwill our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value 
for the purposes of completing our statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment test  we performed our analysis on a reporting unit basis 
we utilize a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in computing fair value of our reporting units  we use estimates of future revenues  costs and cash flows from such units 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of such an impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities 
we elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that there was no impairment 
however  future events or circumstances may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue

we now report financial information for four product line operating segments to our chief executive officer  who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker  or codm  as follows the gpu business  the mcp business  the handheld gpu business  and the consumer electronics business 
revenue in the all other category is primarily derived from sales of memory 
please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
fiscal was a week year  compared to fiscal and which were week years  and we believe that this extra week may have had a positive impact on our revenue in fiscal however  we are not able to quantify the effect of the slightly longer year on our revenue

fiscal year revenue was billion for fiscal  compared to billion for fiscal  which represents an increase of 
a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows gpu business 
gpu business revenue increased by to billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal the increase was the result of increased sales of our geforce and geforce families of desktop gpus that serve the high end gpu segment  offset by a slight decline in sales of our mainstream gpu products 
in addition  sales of our nvidia quadro professional workstation products and notebook products continued to improve due to an increased mix of geforce based and geforce based products  which resulted in an increase in average selling prices 
mcp business 
mcp business revenue was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  which represents an increase of 
the overall increase in mcp business revenue is primarily due to increased sales of nvidia nforce products  which we began selling during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and an increase in average selling prices 
the overall increase was offset by a decrease in sales of nvidia nforce and nvidia nforce products 
handheld gpu business 
handheld gpu business revenue was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  which represents an increase of

consumer electronics business 
consumer electronics business revenue was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  which represents a decrease of 
the decrease in our consumer electronics business is a result of decreased and discontinued sales of our xbox related products to microsoft  partially offset by revenue recognized from our contractual arrangement with sce 
during the first quarter of fiscal  microsoft indicated that it would not order any more xbox related products from us after our second fiscal quarter 
as a result  the second quarter of fiscal was the last quarter during which we recognized revenue from the sale of our xbox related products to microsoft 
during fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from our contractual arrangements with sce to jointly develop a custom gpu incorporating our next generation geforce gpu and sce s system solutions in sce s playstation no such revenue was recognized during our fiscal as our definitive agreement with sce was not executed until the first quarter of fiscal fiscal year vs

gpu business 
gpu business revenue increased by to billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased sales of our nvidia quadro professional workstation products in fiscal  which was due to unit sales volume increases  and an increase in average selling prices as a result of increased board sales 
notebook gpu sales increased in fiscal as a result of sales of our geforce fx go notebook gpu products outpacing the decline in our older notebook gpu product lines during the period 
sales of desktop products increased in fiscal as a result of a significant increase in sales of our high end desktop products  offset by a slight decrease in mainstream desktop products 
high end desktop sales increased in fiscal primarily due to unit volume increases primarily related to our geforce and products 
the decrease in mainstream desktop sales in fiscal was mainly due to competitive pricing in the mainstream segment offset by the ramp of product sales of our geforce with turbocache technology during the fourth quarter of fiscal mcp business 
mcp business revenue increased by to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in mcp business revenue is due to increased sales of nvidia nforce and nvidia nforce products

cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements 
gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue 
our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of products sold 
our gross margin was  and for fiscal  and a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows fiscal year vs 
fiscal year gpu business 
the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the sale of our geforce series gpus and increased sales of our geforce series gpus  which collectively now account for approximately of our gpu business revenue 
our geforce and our geforce series gpus generally have higher gross margins than our geforce fx series gpus which comprised of our fiscal gpu business revenue 
in addition  average selling prices from our notebook geforce and geforce series gpu products increased as a larger percentage of our total notebook revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal mcp business

these increases were offset by an increase of million in license and development project costs  primarily related to increased development costs related to our collaboration with sce and other engineering costs related to a different development contract 
as a portion of our personnel who usually devote their time to research and development efforts have been focusing their efforts on these development projects  the costs associated with these individuals are not charged to research and development  but were charged to cost of revenue in our consolidated statements of income  or were capitalized on our consolidated balance sheets and will be recognized as cost of revenue  on a percentage of completion basis 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits related to additional personnel and a million increase in new product development costs related to an overall increase in the number of product tape outs and in prototype materials 
depreciation and amortization increased million due to emulation hardware and software programs that were purchased during fiscal  resulting in a full year of depreciation in fiscal compared to a partial year of depreciation in fiscal computer software and equipment increased million primarily due to increased allocation of information technology expenses and facilities increased million due to increased facilities expense allocation  both of which were based on the growth in headcount

our collaboration with sce was not in effect during fiscal we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 
research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue

as part of our share repurchase program  we have entered into and we may continue to enter into structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions 
these agreements generally require that we make an up front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement  and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock  within a pre determined range  at the end of the term of the agreement

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures  which could harm our business 
factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and  as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next generation products  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors

if dfx could not make such a certification  but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than million  then dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock  with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by per share 
if dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for  or could not be satisfied  for less than million  we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based compensation payments 
in april  the sec delayed the effective date of sfas no 
r  which is now effective for annual periods that begin after june  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab no 
 which includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition 
we intend to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal expensing these incentives in future periods will materially and adversely affect our reported operating results as the stock based compensation expense would be charged directly against our reported earnings 
we anticipate that our stock based compensation expense will be approximately to million for the first quarter of fiscal and we are unsure how the market will react to this adverse affect on our operating results  which could impact our stock price 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we transitioned from a black scholes model to a binomial model for calculating the estimated fair value of new stock based compensation awards granted under our stock option plans 
as a result of recent regulatory guidance  including sab no 
 and in anticipation of the impending effective date of sfas no 
r  we reevaluated the assumptions we use to estimate the value of employee stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan  beginning with stock options granted and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan in our first quarter of fiscal we determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility 
additionally  in the first quarter of fiscal  we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to make full use of the capabilities of the binomial valuation model 
as such  the expected term is based on detailed historical data about employees exercise behavior  vesting schedules  and death and disability probabilities 
we believe the resulting binomial calculation provides a more refined estimate of the fair value of our employee stock options 
for our employee stock purchase plan  we decided to continue to use the black scholes model to calculate the estimated fair value 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
we will adopt sfas during the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force s  or eitf s  issue no 
 or eitf no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements 
eitf no 
provides that the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease be the shorter of a the useful life of the assets or b a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase 
the provisions of eitf no 
are effective on a prospective basis for leasehold improvements purchased or acquired 
we adopted eitf no 
during the second quarter of fiscal and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued staff position  or fsp  fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
we will adopt this fsp during the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe the adoption of this fsp will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
this fsp requires an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional paid in capital pool as prescribed in sfas no 
r  share based payment  or the alternative transition method as described in the fsp 
an entity that adopts sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application may make a one time election to adopt the transition method described in this fsp 
an entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of sfas no 
r or the effective date of this fsp to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one time election 
this fsp became effective in november we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this fsp could have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
as of january   we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments 
according to our analysis  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately million 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
to date  we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future
