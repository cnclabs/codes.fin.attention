item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as puget energy s and puget sound energy s pse objectives  expectations and intentions 
words or phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  plans  predicts  projects  will likely result  will continue and similar expressions are intended to identify certain of these forward looking statements 
however  these words are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements 
in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
puget energy s and pse s actual results could differ materially from results that may be anticipated by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled forward looking statements included elsewhere in this report 
except as required by law  neither puget energy nor pse undertakes an obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may subsequently arise 
readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in puget energy s and pse s other reports filed with the united states securities and exchange commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect puget energy s and pse s business  prospects and results of operations 
overview puget energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its two subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are pse  a regulated electric and gas utility company  and infrastrux  a utility construction and services company 
following a strategic review of puget energy s unregulated subsidiary  infrastrux  on february   puget energy s board of directors decided to exit the utility construction services sector 
puget energy intends to monetize its interest in infrastrux through a sale 
see section titled infrastrux for further discussion 
puget sound energy pse generates revenues from the sale of electric and gas services  mainly to residential and commercial customers within washington state 
a majority of pse s revenues are generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating season in washington state 
as a regulated utility company  pse is subject to federal energy regulatory commission ferc and washington utilities and transportation commission washington commission regulation which may impact a large array of business activities  including limitation of future rate increases  directed accounting requirements that may negatively impact earnings  licensing of pse owned generation facilities  and other ferc and washington commission directives that may impact pse s long term goals 
in addition  pse is subject to risks inherent to the utility industry as a whole  including weather changes affecting purchases and sales of energy  outages at owned and non owned generation plants where energy is obtained  storms or other events which can damage electric distribution and transmission lines  and wholesale market stability over time 
pse s main operational objective is to provide reliable  safe and cost effective energy to its customers 
to help accomplish this objective  pse intends to be more self sufficient in energy generation resources 
owning more generation resources will reduce the company s reliance on the wholesale energy market 
pse is continually exploring for new electric power resource generation and long term power purchase agreements to meet this goal 
the completion of the hopkins ridge wind project in the fourth quarter and the closing of its acquisition of the wild horse wind project in the third quarter are two steps in reaching this goal 
the hopkins ridge wind project was placed into service on november  and is designed to provide approximately mw of capacity or average mw 
pse also issued notice to proceed with construction of the wild horse wind project in the third quarter which is expected to be completed by december  the wild horse wind project is designed to provide approximately mw of capacity or average mw 
the wild horse wind project will require approximately million in capital requirements in  in addition to million spent in included in the million estimate is the cost to acquire land  wind turbines and other necessary assets  construction costs  and transaction  financing and contingency costs 
together these wind electric generation resources will serve the needs of approximately  of pse s electric customers 
the hopkins ridge wind project and the wild horse wind project were included as part of pse s energy resource portfolio in its long term electric least cost plan that was filed may  with the washington commission 
the plan supports a strategy of diverse resource acquisitions including resources fueled by natural gas and coal  renewable resources and shared resources 
the least cost plan was followed by issuing an all source request for proposal rfp on november  pse obtained approval of the all source rfp from the washington commission on october  infrastrux following a strategic review of infrastrux conducted by puget energy management  on february   puget energy s board of directors decided to exit the utility construction services sector 
puget energy intends to monetize its interest in infrastrux through a sale 
infrastrux generates revenues mainly from maintenance services and construction contracts in the midwest  texas  south central and eastern united states 
generally  the majority of its revenues are generated during the second and third quarters  which are typically the most productive quarters for the construction industry due to longer daylight hours and generally better weather conditions 
infrastrux is subject to risks associated with the construction industry  including inability to adequately estimate costs of projects that are bid under fixed fee contracts  continued economic downturn that limits the amount of projects available thereby reducing available profit margins due to increased competition  the ability to integrate acquired companies within its operations without significant cost  and the ability to obtain adequate financing and bonding coverage to continue expansion and growth 
infrastrux s main goals have been continued growth and expansion into underdeveloped utility construction markets and to utilize its acquired entities to capitalize on depth of expertise  asset base  geographical location and workforce to provide services that local contractors cannot provide 
infrastrux has acquired entities since financial condition and results of operations puget energy all the operations of puget energy are conducted through its subsidiaries  pse and infrastrux 
net income in was million on operating revenues from continuing operations of billion compared to million on operating revenues from continuing operations of billion in and million on operating revenues from continuing operations of billion in income from continuing operations in was million compared to million in and million in basic earnings per share in were on million weighted average common shares outstanding compared to on million weighted average common shares outstanding in and on million weighted average common shares outstanding in diluted earnings per share in were on million weighted average common shares outstanding compared to on million weighted average common shares outstanding in and on million weighted average common shares outstanding in included in basic and diluted earnings per share for was  compared to and for and  respectively related to discontinued operations 
net income in was positively impacted by an increase in income from continuing operations of million due to increased electric and gas margins of million 
this increase was due primarily to a higher tenaska disallowance in of million compared to million in increased electricity and gas sales volumes increased margin by million as compared to gas margin also increased million as a result of the gas general rate case  partially offset by a million one time true up of previously reported gas costs 
offsetting the increases were higher operations and maintenance costs of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
in addition  income from discontinued operations increased million in compared to primarily due to lower non cash impairments and favorable industry conditions in the utility construction services sector 
in  puget energy recorded carrying value adjustments on the infrastrux investment and related transaction costs of million 
in  infrastrux recorded a million million after tax and minority interest goodwill impairment charge 
net income in was adversely impacted by an infrastrux non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax and minority interest and a million million after tax disallowance of the return on the tenaska gas supply regulatory asset as a result of a washington commission order in pse s power cost only rate case pcorc 
net income was also negatively impacted by an increase in depreciation expense of million  primarily due to the acquisition of frederickson and other pse infrastructure projects 
these negative impacts were offset by improved electric margins of million compared to and lower interest expense at pse of million 
in addition  results were not impacted by one time tax benefits of million or the write down of million in the carrying value of a non utility venture capital investment which occurred in net income in was positively impacted by a million increase in infrastrux s net income  excluding the goodwill impairment charge and net of minority interest 
the net income increase at infrastrux was due to improved operating efficiencies and improvements in weather conditions compared to  which positively impacted productivity 
puget sound energy pse s operating revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly during the year 
variations in energy usage by consumers occur from season to season and from month to month within a season  primarily as a result of weather conditions 
pse normally experiences its highest retail energy sales during the heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales in the third quarter of the year 
varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to pse also make quarter to quarter comparisons difficult 
puget sound energy compared to energy margins pse uses the following margin information in reviewing its operations to determine whether pse is collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from its customers to allow operating cost recovery 
the following table displays the details of electric margin changes from to electric margin is electric sales to retail and transportation customers less pass through tariff items and revenue sensitive taxes  and the cost of generating and purchasing electric energy sold to customers  including transmission costs to bring electric energy to pse s service territory

for  total electric power costs were million  which includes electric generation fuel and purchased electricity  net of sales to other utilities and marketers see note above  but does not include the residential exchange credit of million and unrealized net loss on derivative instruments of million 
these amounts excluding sales of electricity to other utilities and marketers provide electric energy costs of million 
for  total electric power costs were million  which includes electric generation fuel and purchased electricity  net of sales to other utilities and marketers see note above  but does not include the residential exchange credit of million and unrealized net gain on derivative instruments of million 
these amounts excluding sales of electricity to other utilities and marketers provide electric energy costs of million 
electric margin does not include any allocation for amortization depreciation expense or electric generation operations and maintenance expense 
electric margin increased million in compared to primarily as a result of the tenaska disallowance recorded in may  and ongoing tenaska disallowances  which reduced margin by million for compared to million in other items that increased margin include a increase in retail customer usage which contributed million to margin 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in transmission and transportation revenues in compared to which reduced electric margin by million 
customers also received a reduction in revenue of million related to production tax credits for the hopkins ridge wind generating facility which lowered electric revenue and margin 
these credits will vary quarter to quarter and over time the amounts credited to customers through lower electric rates will equal the amount used for federal income taxes 
a lower authorized return on electric generating facilities that became effective on march  also lowered electric margin by million

gas margin increased million for compared to gas margin increased million as a result of the gas general tariff rate increase of effective march  in addition  therm sales increased for compared to  which provided million to gas margin and changes in customer class usage provided million to gas margin 
negatively impacting gas margin for was a million one time true up of previously reported gas costs under the pga mechanism

electric operating revenues the table below sets forth changes in electric operating revenues for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change electric operating revenues residential sales commercial sales industrial sales other retail sales  including unbilled revenue total retail sales transportation sales sales to other utilities and marketers other total electric operating revenues electric retail sales increased million for compared to due primarily to rate increases related to the pcorc and the electric general rate case and increased retail customer usage 
the pcorc and electric general rate case provided a combined additional million to electric operating revenues for compared to  which provided approximately million in electric operating revenues 
retail electricity usage increased  mwh or for compared to the increase in electricity usage was mainly the result of a higher average number of customers served in compared to during  the benefits of the residential and small farm energy exchange benefit credited to customers reduced electric operating revenues by million compared to million for this credit also reduced power costs by a corresponding amount with no impact on earnings 
sales to other utilities and marketers increased million compared to primarily due to an increase of  mwh sold related to excess generation and energy available for sale on the wholesale market 
this resulted primarily from normal streamflows for hydroelectric generation in the third quarter as compared to below normal streamflows that were expected 
the increase in mwh sold was due to differences in timing of the need for power to serve base load and actual weather conditions 
other electric revenues increased million for compared to  primarily from the sale of excess non core gas purchased for intended electric generation 
non core gas sales are included in the pca mechanism calculation as a reduction in determining costs 
the following electric rate changes were approved by the washington commission in and type of rate adjustment effective date average percentage increase in rates annual increase in revenues dollars in millions power cost only rate case may  electric general rate case march  power cost only rate case november  gas operating revenues the table below sets forth changes in gas operating revenues for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change gas operating revenues residential sales commercial sales industrial sales total retail sales transportation sales other total gas operating revenues gas retail sales increased million for compared to due to higher purchased gas adjustment pga mechanism rates in  approval of a general gas rate increase in the gas general rate case effective march  and higher customer gas usage 
the washington commission approved pga mechanism rate increases effective october  that increased rates annually 
the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in gas pipeline transportation costs 
pse s gas margin and net income are not affected by changes under the pga mechanism 
for  the effects of the pga mechanism rate increases provided an increase of million in gas operating revenues 
in addition  the gas general rate increase provided an additional million in gas operating revenue for compared to an increase of in the average number of customers and lower temperatures in increased retail customer usage by million therms or approximately million in retail gas operating revenues 
the following gas rate adjustments were approved by the washington commission in and type of rate adjustment effective date average percentage increase in rates annual increase in revenues dollars in millions pga october  gas general rate case march  pga october  operating expenses the table below sets forth significant changes in operating expenses for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change purchased electricity electric generation fuel residential exchange purchased gas utility operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes income taxes purchased electricity expenses increased million in compared to as a result of increased power purchases from higher customer usage and higher wholesale market prices offset by a reduction in the tenaska disallowance related to the return on the tenaska gas supply regulatory asset 
the reduction of million related to the tenaska disallowance from included a february  washington commission order concerning pse s compliance filing related to the pca period of july  through june  in its order  the washington commission determined that pse was allowed to reflect additional power costs totaling million during the pca period of july  through december  these costs were reflected in the pca mechanism  which resulted in a reduction in purchased electricity expense for total purchased power for increased  mwh  or an increase over pse s hydroelectric production and related power costs in and were negatively impacted by below normal precipitation and reduced snow pack in the pacific northwest region 
the january  columbia basin runoff summary published by the national weather service northwest river forecast center indicated that the total observed runoff above grand coulee reservoir for was of normal  which approximates the total observed runoff for pse cannot determine if lower than normal runoff will continue in future years nor what impact it may have on the amount of electricity that will need to be purchased 
the february  columbia basin runoff summary indicated that the forecasted runoff above grand coulee reservoir for january through july is of normal 
to meet customer demand  pse economically dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil fuel generation  owned and contracted hydroelectric capacity and energy and long term contracted power 
however  depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy  plant availability  fuel prices and or changing load as a result of weather  pse may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market 
pse manages its regulated power portfolio through short term and intermediate term off system physical purchases and sales and through other risk management techniques 
electric generation fuel expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to a million charge recorded in related to a binding arbitration settlement between western energy company and pse 
excluding this settlement  electric generation fuel costs decreased million related to overall lower cost of gas for combustion turbine units and cost of gas at those facilities totaling million 
the decrease in lower cost of gas was partially offset by an increase of the cost of coal of million in compared to due to higher generation at colstrip generating facilities of  mwhs 
costs associated with electric generation fuel are reflected in the pca mechanism 
the reduction in electric generation fuel was also the result of the hopkins ridge wind generation facility beginning operations on november  generation from the hopkins ridge generation facility does not include fuel expenses in its operation 
residential exchange credits associated with the residential purchase and sale agreement with bpa increased million in compared to as a result of increased residential and small farm customer electric load 
the residential exchange credit is a pass through tariff item with a corresponding credit in electric operating revenue  thus it has no impact on electric margin or net income 
purchased gas expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in pga rates as approved by the washington commission 
the pga mechanism allows pse to recover expected gas costs  and defer  as a receivable or liability  any gas costs that exceed or fall short of this expected gas cost amount in pga mechanism rates  including accrued interest 
the pga mechanism receivable balance at december  and was million and million  respectively 
a receivable balance in the pga mechanism reflects a current underrecovery of market gas cost through rates 
for further discussion on pga rates see item business gas regulation and rates 
in the second quarter  pse determined from a review of its pga mechanism that a gas demand charge created during the settlement of the general rate case for a gas customer rate class had not been included within the parameters to calculate the costs under the pga mechanism for rate recovery purposes 
as a result  the balance of the pga mechanism receivable has been overstated due to the exclusion of this charge over a month period from september  to march  the pga mechanism balance and gas costs for include an adjustment of million to reflect the impact of the demand charge for previous years 
this adjustment impacts the comparability of gas margin information and purchased gas expense for compared with utility operations and maintenance expense increased million in compared to which includes an increase of million related to low income program costs that are passed through in retail rates with no impact on earnings 
as a result  the impact on net income from utility operations and maintenance for was an increase of million 
the increase for includes increases of million related to higher gas distribution system expenses  planned maintenance costs for pse owned energy production facilities  electric distribution system costs  regulatory commission expense for rate cases and administrative costs 
the production operation and maintenance increase for also includes a million loss reserve associated with an arbitration panel s ruling in favor of the muckleshoot indian tribe relating to the operation of a fish hatchery on the white river recorded in the second quarter these increases were partially offset by lower storm damage repair costs of million for due to less severe weather and outages 
total storm damage costs for totaled million compared to million in pse anticipates operation and maintenance expense to increase in future years as investments in new generating resources and energy delivery infrastructure are completed 
the timing and amounts of increases will vary depending on when new generating resources come into service 
during  approximately million of operation and maintenance expenses were not recovered in retail rates 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to the effects of new generating and electric and gas distribution system plant placed in service in this includes a full year of depreciation expense related to million for the everett delta gas transmission line placed in service in late and million for the frederickson generating facility in april new plant placed in service in includes million for the hopkins ridge wind project in november pse anticipates depreciation expense will increase in future years as investments in new generating resources and energy delivery infrastructure are completed 
during  approximately million of depreciation and amortization is unrecovered in rates 
taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to primarily due to increases in revenue based washington state excise tax and municipal tax due to increased operating revenues 
revenue sensitive excise and municipal taxes have no impact on earnings 
income taxes increased million in compared to as a result of higher taxable income and the non recurrence of the one time income tax benefit of million in related to a tax audit 
other income and interest charges the table below sets forth significant changes in other income and interest charges for pse from to dollars in millions twelve months ended december change percent change other income net of tax interest charges other income increased million after tax in compared to primarily due to increases in the equity portion of allowance for funds used during construction and a decrease in long term incentive plan costs due to not meeting the performance condition 
interest charges decreased million in compared to due to the redemption of million of long term debt with rates ranging from to in also  in may  pse redeemed million of pse s capital trust preferred securities classified as junior subordinated debentures of the corporation payable to a subsidiary trust holding mandatorily redeemable preferred securities on the balance sheet 
these redemptions and resulting decreases in interest expense were partially offset by the issuance of million and million of long term senior notes in may and october  respectively 
in addition  debt afudc credited to interest expense increased million due to increased construction activity in infrastrux compared to following a strategic review of infrastrux conducted by puget energy management  on february   puget energy s board of directors decided to exit the utility construction services sector 
puget energy intends to monetize its interest in infrastrux through a sale 
puget energy believes the planned disposal of infrastrux meets the criteria established for recognition as a discontinued operation under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and is accounted for as such in puget energy s consolidated financial statements in puget energy is actively marketing infrastrux and retained an investment banking firm to assist in the disposal of infrastrux 
to date  puget energy has not entered into a definitive agreement that would result in the sale of its investment in infrastrux 
for  puget energy reported infrastrux related income from discontinued operations net of taxes and minority interest of million compared to a loss of million net of taxes and minority interest for included in the income for discontinued operations is a charge of million for to adjust puget energy s carrying value of infrastrux to its estimated fair value and for transaction costs

goodwill and other intangible assets  infrastrux s bank and vendor debt under its credit agreements totaled million at december  compared to million at december  in may  infrastrux signed a three year agreement with a group of banks to provide up to million in financing 
under the credit agreement  puget energy is the guarantor of the line of credit 
certain infrastrux subsidiaries also have borrowing capacities for working capital purposes of which puget energy is not the guarantor 
of the million bank facility available to infrastrux  million was outstanding at december  and million was outstanding at december  in determining the fair value of its infrastrux investment  puget energy has determined proceeds on a sale will first be used to extinguish all infrastrux debt outstanding 
in accordance with sfas no 
 puget energy has adjusted the carrying value of its investment in infrastrux to the estimate of fair value  less cost to sell  at december  this estimate could change based on infrastrux financial performance and market conditions in the utility constructions services sector 
after reflecting a million carrying value adjustment and charge for transaction costs in  puget energy s equity investment in infrastrux was million at december  compared to million at december  puget energy s carrying value under sfas no 
as compared to the estimated fair value of its infrastrux investment was not impacted by the non cash goodwill impairment recorded by infrastrux under sfas no 
due to discontinued operations of infrastrux 
as a result  puget energy did not record the effects of the goodwill impairment under sfas no 
in infrastrux s operations are dependent on a number of factors  including weather conditions  the availability of projects and capital to be spent on utility construction projects and key infrastrux customer contractual relationships 
as such  puget energy cannot determine the income or loss from infrastrux s operations  nor any ultimate gain or loss upon completion of the sale of the entity 
it is not anticipated that any funding will be needed from puget energy to maintain operations at infrastrux or to complete the sale transaction

off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable securitization program 
in order to provide a source of liquidity to pse at an attractive cost  pse entered into a receivables sales agreement with rainier receivables  inc  rainier receivables a wholly owned subsidiary of pse  in december which expired december  pursuant to the receivables sales agreement  pse sold all its utility customers accounts receivable and unbilled utility revenues to rainier receivables 
concurrently with entering into the receivables sales agreement  rainier receivables entered into a receivables purchase agreement with pse and a third party 
the receivables purchase agreement allowed rainier receivables to sell the receivables purchased from pse to the third party 
the amount of receivables sold by rainier receivables was not permitted to exceed million at any time 
the receivables securitization facility was the functional equivalent of a revolving line of credit secured by receivables 
in the event rainier receivables elected to sell the receivables under the receivables purchase agreement  rainier receivables was required to pay fees to the purchasers that are comparable to interest rates on a revolving line of credit 
as receivables are collected by pse as agent for the receivables purchasers  the outstanding amount of receivables held by the purchasers decline until rainier receivables elected to sell additional receivables to the purchasers 
during the years ended december  and  rainier receivables sold a cumulative million and million of receivables  respectively 
at december   rainier receivables had fully utilized its million available balance under the receivable securitization facility  and therefore had no additional available balances to be sold under the program 
fredonia and operating lease 
pse leases two combustion turbines for its fredonia and electric generating facility pursuant to a master operating lease that was amended for this purpose in april the lease has a term expiring in  but can be canceled by pse at any time 
payments under the lease vary with changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
at december   pse s outstanding balance under the lease was million 
the expected residual value under the lease is the lesser of million or of the cost of the equipment 
in the event the equipment is sold to a third party upon termination of the lease and the aggregate sales proceeds are less than the unamortized value of the equipment  pse would be required to pay the lessor contingent rent in an amount equal to the deficiency up to a maximum of of the unamortized value of the equipment 
utility construction program utility construction expenditures for generation  transmission and distribution are designed to meet continuing customer growth and to improve efficiencies of pse s energy delivery systems 
construction expenditures  excluding equity allowance for funds used during construction afudc and customer refundable contributions  were million for utility construction expenditures  excluding afudc and excluding new generation resources other than the wild horse project which will be determined as the company proceeds through the least cost planning process are anticipated to be the following in and capital expenditure projections dollars in millions energy delivery  technology and facilities wild horse wind project total capital expenditures chelan contract payment total expenditures the chelan contract payment represents a capacity reservation charge in conjunction with an impending new contract for hydroelectric power beginning pse will seek an accounting order from the washington commission for rate base treatment of this payment and pse anticipates it becoming approved as a regulatory asset 
the proposed utility construction expenditures and any new generation resource expenditures that may be incurred are anticipated to be funded with a combination of cash from operations  short term debt  long term debt and equity 
construction expenditure estimates  including the new generation resources  are subject to periodic review and adjustment in light of changing economic  regulatory  environmental and efficiency factors 
new generation resources on november   pse placed into service the hopkins ridge wind project 
hopkins ridge is situated on  acres of remote  open wheat fields in southeastern washington state 
the hopkins ridge wind project features vestas mw wind turbines providing up to mw of nameplate capacity  or average mw 
the energy is delivered to pse s service territory by bpa s transmission system via an interconnection 
pse has spent million to date on the project 
included in this amount is the cost to acquire and construct the wind plant  to fund upgrades to the transmission systems of the bonneville power administration and other regional transmission providers  and for development  transaction and financing costs 
on september   pse completed the acquisition of the wild horse wind project in central washington state from horizon wind energy llc and issued a notice to proceed with construction on the project 
simultaneously  pse entered into an agreement with vestas american wind technology  inc vestas to purchase and construct a total of vestas mw wind turbines providing up to approximately mw of capacity  or average mw 
the wild horse wind project is within pse s service territory and  upon completion in late  the energy will connect to an existing pse transmission line 
pse anticipates spending up to approximately million on the project 
included in the million estimate is the cost to acquire land  wind turbines and other necessary assets  construction costs  and transaction  financing and contingency costs 
through december   pse had spent million on the wild horse project 
capital resources cash from operations cash generated from operations for was million 
during that period  million was used for afudc  which reduced interest expense  and million for payment of dividends 
consequently  cash flows available for utility construction expenditures and other capital expenditures were million or of the million in construction expenditures net of afudc and customer refundable contributions and other capital expenditure requirements for for  cash generated from operations was million 
during that period  million was used for afudc  which reduced interest expense  and million was used for payment of dividends 
therefore  cash flows available for utility construction expenditures and other capital expenditures were million  or of the million in construction expenditures net of afudc and customer refundable contributions and other capital expenditure requirements for the following table provides a summary of cash available and construction expenditures dollars in millions twelve months ended cash from operations less dividends paid afudc cash available for construction expenditures construction and energy efficiency expenditures less afudc cash received from refundable customer contributions net construction and energy efficiency expenditures the overall cash generated from operating activities for decreased million compared to the decrease was primarily the result of changes in the utilization of sales of accounts receivable under the accounts receivable securitization program which contributed million to the decrease in cash generated from operations 
also contributing to the decrease was an increase in fuel and gas inventory amounting to million  changes in the purchase gas receivable that contributed million to the decrease  changes in deferred income taxes and taxes payable amounting to million  and an increase of prepaid transmission amounting to million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable balance of million as compared to  a decrease in prepaid items amounting to million and funds received from a gas pipeline assignment amounting to million 
financing program financing utility construction requirements and operational needs are dependent upon the cost and availability of external funds through capital markets and from financial institutions 
access to funds is dependent upon factors such as general economic conditions  regulatory authorizations and policies and puget energy s and pse s credit ratings 
restrictive covenants in determining the type and amount of future financing  pse may be limited by restrictions contained in its electric and gas mortgage indentures  articles of incorporation and certain loan agreements 
the goodwill impairment at puget energy does not cause any violations of financial covenants at puget energy or pse 
under the most restrictive tests  at december   pse could issue approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds under pse s electric mortgage indenture based on approximately million of electric bondable property available for issuance  subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of times net earnings available for interest  which pse exceeded at december   approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds under pse s gas mortgage indenture based on approximately million of gas bondable property available for issuance  subject to an interest coverage ratio limitation of times net earnings available for interest  which pse exceeded at december   approximately million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of  and approximately million of unsecured long term debt 
at december   pse had approximately billion in electric and gas ratebase to support the interest coverage ratio limitation test for net earnings available for interest 
credit ratings neither puget energy nor pse has any debt outstanding that would accelerate debt maturity upon a credit rating downgrade 
however  a ratings downgrade could adversely affect the ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities 
for example  under pse s revolving credit facility  the borrowing costs and commitment fee increase as pse s secured long term debt ratings decline 
a downgrade in commercial paper ratings could preclude pse s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs 
the marketability of pse commercial paper is currently limited by the a p ratings by standard poor s and moody s investors service 
in addition  downgrades in any or a combination of pse s debt ratings may prompt counterparties on a contract by contract basis in the wholesale electric  wholesale gas and financial derivative markets to require pse to post a letter of credit or other collateral  make cash prepayments  obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security

shelf registrations  long term debt and common stock activity on april   puget energy and pse filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the offering  on a delayed or continuous basis  of up to million of common stock of puget energy  and senior notes of pse  secured by a pledge of pse s first mortgage bonds 
on may   pse made an offer to repurchase all of pse s capital trust preferred securities classified as junior subordinated debentures of the corporation payable to a subsidiary trust holding mandatorily redeemable preferred securities on the balance sheet 
the purpose of the tender offer was to help reduce interest costs by retiring higher cost debt 
as a result of the tender offer  million of the capital trust preferred securities were redeemed on june  at a premium which totaled approximately million 
pse may undertake future tender offers to reduce higher cost debt depending on future market opportunities 
in may  pse completed the issuance of million of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds  at a rate of  due june  the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes of approximately million were used to redeem million of variable rate senior notes  which were redeemed at par in may  and to repay a portion of pse s short term debt 
in october  pse completed the issuance of million of senior notes secured by first mortgage bonds  at a rate of  due october  the net proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes of approximately million were used to repay a portion of pse s short term debt 
in november  puget energy sold million shares of common stock to lehman brothers inc for million before underwriting discount 
the net proceeds of approximately million were invested in pse and used to repay short term debt incurred primarily to fund pse s construction program 
based on pse s goal to become a more vertically integrated utility  it is expected that further issuances of debt  equity or a combination of the two will be necessary within one to two years to fund acquisitions of new generating resources 
the structure  timing and amount of such financings are dependent on market conditions  projects available to be developed and financing needed at the time of any such acquisitions 
liquidity facilities and commercial paper pse s short term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital and funding of utility construction programs 
pse credit facilities 
in may  pse entered into a three year  million unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks 
in march  pse amended this credit agreement  increasing the total borrowing capacity from million to million  and extended the expiration date from june to april under the terms of the credit agreement  pse pays a floating interest rate on outstanding borrowings based either on the agent bank s prime rate or on libor plus a marginal rate based on pse s long term credit rating at the time of borrowing 
pse pays a commitment fee on any unused portion of the credit agreement also based on long term credit ratings of pse 
pse also has a million receivables securitization program which expires in december at december   pse had available million in the unsecured credit agreement and million available under its receivable securitization facility  both of which provide credit support for outstanding commercial paper and outstanding letters of credit 
at december   there was million outstanding under a letter of credit and no commercial paper outstanding  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under these liquidity facilities to million 
in addition  pse has an uncommitted million unsecured credit agreement with a bank 
pse pays a varying interest rate on outstanding borrowings based on terms entered into at the time of the borrowings 
there were no amounts outstanding under this credit agreement at december  or pse funding receivables securitization facility 
in order to provide a source of liquidity to pse at an attractive cost  pse entered into a five year receivable sales agreement with pse funding  inc pse funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of pse  on december  the pse funding agreement replaced the rainier securitization facility  which terminated on december  pursuant to the receivables sales agreement  pse sells all of its utility customer accounts receivable and unbilled utility revenues to pse funding 
in addition  pse funding entered into a loan and servicing agreement with pse and two banks 
the loan and servicing agreement allows pse funding to use the receivables as collateral to secure short term loans  not exceeding the lesser of million or the borrowing base of eligible receivables which fluctuate with the seasonality of energy sales to customers 
the loans will be reported as short term debt in the financial statements 
the pse funding receivables securitization facility expires in december  and is terminable by pse and pse funding upon notice to the banks 
during  pse funding borrowed a cumulative amount of million secured by accounts receivable and had million of loans secured by accounts receivable pledged as collateral at december  puget energy credit facility 
puget energy had a million credit agreement that was to expire in may with a bank 
on february   puget energy reduced the borrowing capacity of this credit agreement to million and on september  repaid all outstanding amounts and cancelled the agreement 
puget energy had million outstanding under the credit agreement at december  stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan puget energy has a stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to which shareholders and other interested investors may invest cash and cash dividends in shares of puget energy s common stock 
since new shares of common stock may be purchased directly from puget energy  funds received may be used for general corporate purposes 
puget energy issued common stock from the stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan of million  shares in compared to million  shares in the proceeds from sales of stock under these plans are used for general corporate needs 
common stock offering programs to provide additional financing options  puget energy entered into agreements in july with two financial institutions under which puget energy may offer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through these institutions as sales agents  or as principals 
sales of the common stock  if any  may be made by means of negotiated transactions or in transactions that may be deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in rule promulgated under the securities act of  including in ordinary brokers transactions on the new york stock exchange at market prices 
other irs notice of proposed adjustment 
on july   puget energy received a notice of proposed adjustment nopa from the internal revenue service relating to a deduction in puget energy s tax return 
the deduction relates to the receivable balance due from the california independent system operator 
the nopa states that the deduction was not valid for the tax year and would require repayment of approximately million in tax 
puget energy believes the deduction is valid and intends to vigorously defend the deduction  however  the outcome of this issue cannot be predicted 
any potential tax related payment excluding interest would have no impact on earnings as it would be recognized as a deferred tax asset 
if the company is unsuccessful  a charge for interest expense could apply 
tenaska disallowance 
the washington commission issued an order on may  determining that pse did not prudently manage gas costs for the tenaska electric generating plant and ordered pse to adjust its pca deferral account to reflect a disallowance of accumulated costs under the pca mechanism for these excess costs 
the increase in purchased electricity expense resulting from the disallowance totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the order also established guidelines and a benchmark to determine pse s recovery on the tenaska regulatory asset starting with the pca period july  through the expiration of the tenaska contract in the year the benchmark is defined as the original cost of the tenaska contract adjusted to reflect the disallowance from a prudence order 
in august pse filed the pca period compliance and received an order from the washington commission on february  in the pca compliance order  the washington commission approved the washington commission staff s recommendation for an additional return related to the tenaska regulatory asset in the amount of million related to the period july  through december  the washington commission guidelines for determining future recovery of the tenaska costs gas costs  recovery of the tenaska regulatory asset and return on the tenaska regulatory asset are as follows the washington commission will determine if pse s gas purchasing plan and gas purchases for tenaska are prudent through the pca compliance filings 
if pse s gas purchasing plan and gas purchases for tenaska are prudent  and if pse s actual tenaska costs fall at or below the benchmark  it will fully recover its tenaska costs 
if pse s gas purchasing plan and gas purchases for tenaska are prudent  but its actual tenaska costs exceed the benchmark  pse will only recover of the lesser of a actual tenaska costs that exceed the benchmark  or b the return on the tenaska regulatory asset 
if pse s gas purchasing plan or gas purchases are found to be imprudent in a future proceeding  pse risks disallowance of any and all tenaska costs 
the washington commission confirmed that if the tenaska gas costs are deemed prudent  pse will recover the full amount of actual gas costs and the recovery of the tenaska regulatory asset even if the benchmark is exceeded 
due to fluctuations in forward market prices of gas  the amount and timing of any potential disallowance related to tenaska can change significantly day to day 
the projected costs and projected benchmark costs for tenaska as of december  based on current forward market gas prices are as follows dollars in millions projected tenaska costs projected tenaska benchmark costs over under benchmark costs projected disallowance based on washington commission methodology projection will change based on market conditions of gas and replacement power costs 
proceedings relating to the western power market the following discussion summarizes the status as of the date of this report of ongoing proceedings in which pse is a party relating to the western power markets 
pse intends to vigorously defend against each of these cases and does not expect the ultimate resolution of these proceedings in the aggregate to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
however  there can be no assurances in that regard because litigation is subject to numerous uncertainties and pse is unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
accordingly  there can be no guarantee that these proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will not materially and adversely affect pse s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
california receivable and california refund proceeding 
in  pg e and southern california edison failed to pay the california independent system operator corporation caiso and the california px for energy purchases 
the caiso in turn failed to pay various energy suppliers  including pse  for energy sales made by pse into the california energy market during the fourth quarter both pg e and the california px filed for bankruptcy in  further constraining pse s ability to receive payments due to bankruptcy court controls placed on the distribution of funds by the california px and the escrow of funds owed by pg e for purchases during the fourth quarter that are owed by the california px 
a 
california refund proceeding 
on july   ferc ordered an evidentiary hearing docket no 
el to determine the amount of refunds due to california energy buyers for purchases made in the spot markets operated by the caiso and the california px during the period october  through june  refund period 
the caiso continues its efforts to prepare revised settlement statements based on newly recalculated costs and charges for spot market sales to california during the refund period 
if the refunds required by the formula would cause a seller to recover less than its actual costs for the refund period  ferc has held that the seller would be allowed to document these costs and limit its refund liability commensurately 
in august  pse submitted its audited fuel cost allowance claim with the caiso 
that claim is currently pending 
in september  pse submitted an additional cost filing claim pursuant to ferc s august order  demonstrating an overall revenue shortfall for sales into the california spot markets during the refund period after the mitigated market clearing price methodology was applied to its transactions 
in january  ferc issued its order on cost filings accepting pse s cost filing claim subject to certain modifications and the utilization of final caiso data 
pse does not agree with all of ferc s rulings and will seek rehearing of some of ferc s determinations 
once the caiso receives updated cost offset filings from sellers  including pse  it will continue efforts to prepare revised settlement statements for spot market sales to california during the refund period 
thus  pse s ability to recover all or a part of its costs remains uncertain at this time 
global settlements have been announced and or approved  including settlements between the california parties and williams  duke  el paso  mirant  dynegy  enron  reliant and public service company of colorado 
these settlements  supported by a statement from ferc chairman joseph kelliher  may suggest that the process momentum toward settlement in the california refund proceedings is increasing 
many of the numerous orders that ferc issued in docket no 
el are on appeal before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
some of those issues have been consolidated as a result of a case management conference conducted on september  the ninth circuit ordered on october  that briefing proceed in two rounds 
the first round was limited to three issues which parties are subject to ferc s refund jurisdiction in light of the exemption for government owned utilities in section f of the federal power act fpa  the temporal scope of refunds under section of the fpa  and which categories of transactions are subject to refunds 
pse joined the brief of the competitive supplier group  which argued that ferc has proposed to require payment of refunds without proper notice to sellers  without proper limits on the type of transactions affected and without a finding that the transactions subject to refund in fact produced prices that were unjust and unreasonable 
the court heard oral argument on april and  on september   the court ruled that  as to the first issue  ferc does not have refund authority over wholesale electric sales made by governmental utilities 
no decision has been issued on the other issues argued in april the order remanding the proceeding back to ferc and the time for seeking rehearing in the governmental utilities case has been extended until days after a decision on the other issues identified above 
the parties await a decision from the court on the remaining two other issues 
procedures will be established for the remaining issues  if necessary  after the court s disposition of the first round of issues 
b 
caiso receivable 
at december   pse had a net receivable totaling million in connection with wholesale sales in to the california independent system operator caiso and counterparties where payment to pse was conditioned on the counterparties being paid by the california power exchange 
in august  pse submitted a fuel cost adjustment claim for million related to sales in to the caiso  pursuant to ferc s california refund proceeding 
pursuant to an order issued by ferc in august  pse also submitted a portfolio cost claim in september for million to the caiso 
on january   ferc issued its order on cost filings accepting pse s cost filing subject to certain modifications  which appear to have the effect of reducing pse s portfolio claim substantially  possibly to zero 
however  the company does not believe the claim will be reduced below the million receivable 
pse does not agree with all of ferc s rulings and may seek rehearing 
pse s ability to recover all or a portion of these claims is uncertain at the present time 
based upon ferc orders  pse has determined a range related to its caiso receivable to be between million pse s net receivable balance and million including interest on its past due receivables as of december pacific northwest refund proceeding 
in october  pse filed a complaint at ferc docket no 
el against all jurisdictional sellers in the pacific northwest seeking prospective price caps consistent with any result ferc supplied for the california markets 
ferc dismissed pse s complaint on december   although pse filed for rehearing in january when ferc issued its june  order in docket no 
el  imposing west wide price constraints on energy sales  pse moved to withdraw its rehearing request and its complaint in docket no 
el  on the basis that the relief pse sought was fully provided 
various parties  including the port of seattle and the cities of seattle and tacoma  moved to intervene in the proceeding 
they asserted the ability to adopt pse s complaint to obtain retroactive refunds for numerous transactions  including many that were not within the scope of the pse complaint 
the proceeding became commonly referenced as the pacific northwest refund proceeding  despite the fact that the original complainant  pse  did not seek retroactive refunds 
a preliminary evidentiary hearing was held in september  and an administrative law judge recommendation against refunds followed 
in december  ferc issued an order permitting additional discovery and the submission of any additional evidence parallel to the order issued in the california refund proceeding that reopened the matter to permit parties to introduce any evidence they claimed to have of market manipulation 
a few parties made filings asserting market manipulation in early march  and numerous parties  including pse  responded to those allegations in late march on june   ferc issued an order terminating the proceeding  largely on procedural  jurisdictional and equitable grounds 
various parties filed rehearing requests on july  on november   ferc affirmed an order terminating the pacific northwest refund proceeding  docket no 
el  largely on procedural  jurisdictional and equitable grounds 
seven petitions for review  including pse s  are now pending before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
opening briefs were filed on january  pse s opening brief addressed procedural flaws underlying the action of ferc 
specifically  pse argued that because pse s complaint in the underlying docket was withdrawn as a matter of law on july   ferc erred in relying on it to serve as the basis to initiate a preliminary investigation into whether refunds for individually negotiated bilateral transactions in the pacific northwest were appropriate 
briefing is complete and the parties await a date for oral argument 
orders to show cause 
on june   ferc issued two show cause orders pertaining to its western market investigations that commenced individual proceedings against many sellers 
one show cause order docket nos 
el  et seq

ferc approved the settlement on january  the california parties filed for rehearing of that order  repeating arguments that had already been addressed by ferc 
on march   pse filed a motion to dismiss the california parties rehearing request  and awaits ferc action on that motion 
port of seattle suit 
on may   the port of seattle commenced suit in federal court in seattle against energy sellers  alleging that their conduct during and constituted market manipulation  violated antitrust laws and damaged the port of seattle 
the port had a contract to purchase its energy supply from pse at the time 
the port s contract linked the price of the energy sold to the port to an index price for energy sold at wholesale at the mid columbia trading hub 
the port alleged that the mid columbia price was inten tionally affected improperly by the defendants  including pse  and alleges damages of over million 
on may   the district court dismissed the lawsuit 
the port of seattle filed an appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  and on september   filed a brief in the ninth circuit arguing that the district court erred in dismissing its claims 
responses to the port s brief were filed november  oral argument is scheduled to take place on march  wah chang v 
avista corp  pse and others 
in june  puget energy and pse were served a federal summons and complaint by wah chang  an oregon company 
wah chang claims that during through the company and other energy companies and in a separate complaint  energy marketers engaged in various fraudulent and illegal activities including the transmittal of electronic wire communications to transmit false or misleading information to manipulate the california energy market 
the claims include submitting false information such as energy schedules and bids to the california px  caiso  electronic trading platforms and publishers of energy indexes  alleges damages of not less than million and seeks treble and punitive damages  attorneys fees and costs 
the complaint is similar to the allegations made by the port of seattle currently on appeal in the ninth circuit 
the judicial panel on multi district litigation consolidated this case with another pending multi district case and transferred it to federal district court in san diego on august  the defendants in both cases filed motions to dismiss on october  both cases were dismissed on the grounds that ferc has the exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiff s claims 
on march   wah chang filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
opening and response briefs were filed and the appeal has been consolidated with wah chang s complaint against energy marketers 
the parties await a date for oral argument 
california litigation 
attorney general cases 
on may   ferc conditionally dismissed a complaint filed on march  by the california attorney general in docket no 
el that alleged violations of the fpa by ferc and all sellers including pse of electric power and energy into california 
the complaint asserted that ferc s adoption and implementation of market rate authority was flawed and  as a result  individual sellers such as pse were liable for sales of energy at rates that were unjust and unreasonable 
the condition for dismissal was that all sellers refile transaction summaries of sales to and  after a clarifying order issued on june   purchases from certain california entities during and pse refiled such transaction summaries on july and july  the order of dismissal went on appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
on september   the ninth circuit issued a decision on the california attorney general s challenge to the validity of ferc s market based rate system lockyer v 
ferc 
this case was originally presented to ferc 
the ninth circuit upheld ferc s authority to authorize sales of electric energy at market based rates  but found the requirement that all sales at market based rates be contained in quarterly reports filed with ferc to be integral to a market based rate tariff 
the california parties  among others  have interpreted the decision as providing authority to ferc to order refunds for different time frames and based on different rationales than are currently pending in the california refund proceedings  discussed above in california refund proceeding 
the decision itself defers the question of whether to seek refunds to ferc 
pse  along with other defendants in the proceeding  sought rehearing of the ninth circuit s decision on october  the ninth circuit has yet to issue an order on the rehearing request 
because the current ninth circuit decision may open new periods of transactions to refund claims under new theories  pse cannot predict the scope  nature or ultimate resolution of this case 
that additional uncertainty may make the outcomes of certain other western energy market cases less predictable than previously anticipated 
california class actions 
in may  pse was served with two cross complaints  by reliant energy services and duke energy trading marketing  respectively  in six consolidated class actions filed in superior court in san diego  california 
plaintiffs in the lawsuit sought  among other things  restitution of all funds acquired by means that violate the law and payment of treble damages  interest and penalties 
the cross complaints asserted essentially that the cross defendants  including pse  were also participants in the california energy market at the relevant times  and that any remedies ordered against some market participants should be ordered against all 
reliant and duke also sought indemnification  declaratory relief and conditional relief as buyers in transactions involving cross defendants should the plaintiffs prevail 
the case was removed to federal court and some of the newly added defendants  including pse  moved to dismiss the action 
on july   the court considered a proposed settlement that would resolve all claims against the duke parties and on december   the court issued a judgment and order approving the duke settlement 
in august  reliant also announced it had reached a settlement that would result in the dismissal of the master complaint 
the court issued a judgment and order preliminarily approving the reliant settlement on january  hearing on final approval for the reliant settlement is scheduled for april duke and reliant both filed stipulated requests for dismissal of the cross complaints against defendants  including pse 
the dismissals will become final only once the court s orders granting final approval of the duke and reliant settlements become final 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates  assumptions and judgment to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
utility revenues are recognized when the basis of service is rendered  which includes estimates to determine amounts relating to services rendered but not billed 
unbilled electricity revenue is determined by taking mwh generated and purchased less estimated system losses and billed mwh plus unbilled mwh balance at the last true up date 
the estimated system loss percentage for electricity is determined by reviewing historical billed mwh to generated and purchased mwh 
the estimated unbilled mwh balance is then multiplied by the estimated average revenue per mwh 
unbilled gas revenue is determined by taking therms delivered to pse less estimated system losses  prior month unbilled therms and billed therms 
the estimated system loss percentage for gas is determined by reviewing historical billed therms to therms delivered to customers  which vary little from year to year 
the estimated current month unbilled therms is then multiplied by estimated average rate schedule revenue per therm 
non utility revenue is recognized when services are performed or upon the sale of assets 
the recognition of revenue is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue 
the following table represents the sensitivity of the estimate of system losses for both electricity and gas in calculating unbilled revenues assuming an additional increase in the estimated system loss factor since the last annual true up gas revenue decrease millions electric revenue decrease millions increase in loss factor regulatory accounting 
as a regulated entity of the washington commission and ferc  pse prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
the application of sfas no 
results in differences in the timing and recognition of certain revenues and expenses in comparison with businesses in other industries 
the rates that are charged by pse to its customers are based on cost base regulation reviewed and approved by the washington commission and ferc 
under the authority of these commissions  pse has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities at december  in the amount of million and million  respectively  and regulatory assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively  at december  pse expects to fully recover these regulatory assets and liabilities through its rates 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  pse would be required to write off these regulatory assets and liabilities 
in addition  if at some point in the future pse determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of sfas no 
 pse could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
also encompassed by regulatory accounting and subject to sfas no 
are the pca and pga mechanisms 
the pca and pga mechanisms mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the company  and are approved by the washington commission 
the pca mechanism provides for a sharing of costs and benefits that are graduated over four levels of power cost variances with an overall cap of million plus of the excess over the million cap over the four year period ending june  the pca mechanism will continue after july   within certain sharing bands 
see item business regulation and rates electric regulation and rates for further discussion regarding the pca mechanism 
the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply 
pse expects to fully recover these regulatory assets through its rates 
however  both mechanisms are subject to regulatory review and approval by the washington commission on a periodic basis 
derivatives 
puget energy uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its energy commodity price risks  and may enter into certain financial derivatives to manage interest rate risk 
derivative financial instruments are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
accounting for derivatives continues to evolve through guidance issued by the derivatives implementation group dig of the financial accounting standards board fasb 
to the extent that changes by the dig modify current guidance  including the normal purchases and normal sales determination  the accounting treatment for derivatives may change 
to manage its electric and gas portfolios  puget energy enters into contracts to purchase or sell electricity and gas 
these contracts are considered derivatives under sfas no 
unless a determination is made that they qualify for normal purchases and normal sales exception 
if the exception applies  those contracts are not marked to market and are not reflected in the financial statements until delivery occurs 
the availability of the normal purchases and normal sales exception to specific contracts is based on a determination that a resource is available for a forward sale and similarly a determination that at certain times existing resources will be insufficient to serve load 
this determination is based on internal models that forecast customer demand and generation supply 
the models include assumptions regarding customer load growth rates  which are influenced by the economy  weather  the impact of customer choice and resource availability 
the critical assumptions used in the determination of the normal purchases and normal sales exception are consistent with assumptions used in the energy portfolio management process 
energy and financial contracts that are considered derivatives may be eligible for designation as cash flow hedges 
if a contract is designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in its market value is generally deferred as a component of other comprehensive income until the transaction it is hedging is completed 
conversely  the change in the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current period earnings 
pse values derivative instruments based on daily quoted prices from numerous independent energy brokerage services 
when external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts  pse uses a valuation model that uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves 
all derivative instruments are sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
puget energy has a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of pse 
for  and  qualified pension income of million  million and million  respectively  was recorded in the financial statements 
of these amounts  approximately  and offset utility operations and maintenance expense in  and  respectively  and the remaining amounts were capitalized 
qualified pension expense is expected to be million in as a result of lower than expected returns on pension assets 
pse s pension and other postretirement benefits income or costs are dependent on several factors and assumptions  including design of the plan  timing and amount of cash contributions to the plan  earnings on plan assets  discount rate  expected long term rate of return  mortality and health care cost trends 
changes in any of these factors or assumptions will affect the amount of income or expense that puget energy records in its financial statements in future years and its projected benefit obligation 
the company has selected an expected return on plan assets based on a historical analysis of rates of return and the company s investment mix  market conditions  inflation and other factors 
during  pse made no cash contributions to the qualified defined benefit plan and expects to make no contributions in the follow table reflects the estimated sensitivity associated with a change in certain significant actuarial assumptions each assumption change is presented mutually exclusive of other assumption changes change in assumption impact on projected benefit obligation increase decrease impact on pension income increase decrease dollars in thousands pension benefits other benefits pension benefits other benefits increase in discount rate basis points decrease in discount rate basis points increase in return of plan assets basis points decrease in return on plan assets basis points calculation not applicable 
intangibles puget energy only 
puget energy performs an annual impairment review under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to determine if any impairment exists 
in performing the goodwill impairment test  puget energy compares the present value of the future cash flows of estimated earnings of infrastrux which reflects prospective market price information from prospective buyers to the adjusted carrying value of recorded equity 
if goodwill is determined to have an impairment  puget energy will record in the period of determination an impairment charge to earnings 
intangibles with finite lives are amortized based on the expected pattern of use or on a straight line basis over the expected periods to be benefited 
the goodwill and intangibles recorded on the balance sheet of puget energy are the result of acquisition of companies by infrastrux 
during  puget energy recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  or million after tax and minority interest 
as a result  the goodwill balance at december  and was million and million  respectively 
intangible assets have not been impaired and the balance at december  and was million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets puget energy only 
puget energy evaluates impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for determining if long lived assets  including assets to be disposed  are impaired and how losses  if any  should be recognized 
puget energy believes that the present value of the estimated future cash inflows from the use and eventual disposition of long lived assets are sufficient to recover their carrying values 
california reserve 
pse operates within the western wholesale market and has made sales into the california energy market 
at december   pse s receivables from the caiso and other counterparties  was million 
pse received the majority of the partial payments for sales made in the fourth quarter in the first quarter and has since received a small amount of payments 
at december   such receivables were approximately million 
during  ferc issued an order in the california refund proceeding adopting in part and modifying in part ferc s earlier findings by the administrative law judge 
based on the order  pse has determined that the receivables balance at december  is collectible from the caiso 
new accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which revises sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires companies that issue share based payment awards to employees for goods or services to recognize as compensation expense the fair value of the expected vested portion of the award as of the grant date over the vesting period of the award 
forfeitures that occur before the award vesting date will be adjusted from the total compensation expense  but once the award vests  no adjustment to compensation expense will be allowed for forfeitures or unexercised awards 
in addition  sfas no 
r would require recognition of compensation expense of all existing outstanding awards that are not fully vested for their remaining vesting period as of the effective date that were not accounted for under a fair value method of accounting at their award date 
sfas no 
r was originally effective for interim reporting periods beginning after june  however  on april   the securities and exchange commission delayed implementation of sfas no 
r to annual reporting periods beginning after june   which will be january  for the company 
the company had adopted the fair value provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation in january the company adopted sfas no 
r on january  the company does not expect the expense for stock options computed in accordance with sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk energy portfolio management the regulatory mechanisms of the pga and the pca mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility on the company 
the pga mechanism passes through increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply to customers 
the pca mechanism provides for a sharing of costs and benefits that are graduated over four levels of power cost variances with an overall cap of million plus of the excess over the million cap over the four year period ending june  for the period july  through december   the sharing bands will be half of the annual bands without a cap for excess power costs and beginning january   the pca mechanism will provide sharing of costs and benefits that are graduated over four levels for each calendar year without a maximum cap for excess power costs 
the company is focused on commodity price exposure and risks associated with volumetric variability in the gas portfolio and electric portfolio for its customers 
gas and electric portfolio exposure is managed in accordance with company polices and procedures 
the energy management committee  which is composed of company officers  provides policy level and strategic direction for management of the energy portfolio 
the finance and budget committee of the company s board of directors periodically assesses risk management policies 
the nature of serving regulated electric customers with its wholesale portfolio of owned and contracted resources exposes the company and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the pca 
the company s energy portfolio management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools 
the company manages its energy supply portfolio to achieve three primary objectives ensure that physical energy supplies are available to serve retail customer requirements  manage portfolio risks to limit undesired impacts on the company s costs  and maximize the value of the company s energy supply assets 
the company is not engaged in the business of assuming risk for the purpose of speculative trading revenues 
therefore wholesale market transactions are focused on balancing the company s energy portfolio  reducing costs and risks where feasible  and reducing volatility in wholesale costs and margin in the portfolio 
in order to manage risks effectively  the company enters into physical and financial transactions  which are appropriate for the service territory of the company and are relevant to its regulated electric and gas portfolios 
the risk metrics the company employs are aimed at assessing exposure for the purposes of developing strategies to reduce the potential exposure on a cost effective basis in regulated utility gas and electric portfolios 
specifically  the amount of risk exposure is defined by time period and by portfolio 
it is determined through statistical methods aimed at forecasting risk 
the energy portfolio management staff models forecasted load requirements and expected resource availability  and projects the net deficit or surplus position resulting from any imbalance between load requirements and existing resources 
however  the portfolios are subject to major sources of variability eg  hydroelectric generation  outage risk  regional economic factors  temperature sensitive retail sales and market prices for gas and power supplies 
at certain times  these sources of variability can mitigate portfolio imbalances and at other times they can exacerbate portfolio imbalances 
because of the volumetric and cost variability within the electric and gas portfolios  the company runs market simulations to model potential risk scenarios 
in this way  strategies can be developed to address the expected case as well as other potential scenarios 
resources in the gas portfolio include gas supply arrangements  gas storage and gas transportation contracts 
resources in the electric portfolio include power purchase agreements  generating resources and transmission contracts 
the company s energy portfolio management staff develops hedging strategies to manage deficit or surplus positions in the portfolios 
the company s energy risk policy states that hedging and optimization strategies will be consistent with company objectives 
the company relies on risk analysis  operational factors  professional judgment of its employees and fundamental analysis 
the company will engage in transactions that reduce risks in its electric and gas portfolios  and optimize unused capacity where possible 
cost and reliability factors are considered in its hedging strategies 
the company s hedging activities are aimed at removing risks from the company s electric and gas portfolios  giving important consideration to cost of hedges and lost opportunity in order to find a balance between price stability and least cost 
the hedge strategies for the gas and electric portfolios incorporate risk analysis  operational factors and professional judgment of its employees as well as fundamental analysis 
programmatic hedge plans are developed to ensure disciplined hedging and discretion is used in hedging within specific guidelines of the programmatic hedge plans approved by the energy management committee 
the company s programmatic hedging strategies may be modified  as approved by the energy management committee  in response to market fundamental information and trends 
most hedges can be implemented in ways that retain the company s ability to use its energy supply optimization opportunities 
some hedges are structured similarly to insurance instruments  where the company pays an insurance premium to protect against certain extreme conditions 
without jeopardizing the security of supply within its portfolio  the company also engages in optimizing the portfolio 
optimization may take the form of utilizing excess capacity  shaping flexible resources to capture their highest value and utilizing transmission capacity through third party transactions 
as a result  portions of the company s energy portfolio are monetized through the use of forward price instruments  which help reduce overall costs 
the company has entered into master netting agreements with counterparties when available to mitigate credit exposure to those counterparties 
the company believes that entering into such agreements reduces risk of settlement default for the ability to make only one net payment 
in addition  the company believes risk is mitigated with an improved position in potential counterparty bankruptcy situations due to a consistent netting approach 
at december   the company was subject to a range of netting provisions  including both stand alone agreements and the provisions associated with the western systems power pool agreement of which many energy suppliers in the western united states are a part 
transactions that qualify as hedge transactions under sfas no 
are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in fair value of the company s derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income 
short term derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity are valued based on daily quoted prices from an independent energy brokerage service 
valuations for short term and medium term natural gas financial derivatives are derived from a combination of quotes from several independent energy brokers and are updated daily 
long term gas financial derivatives are valued based on published pricing from a combination of independent brokerage services and are updated monthly 
option contracts are valued using market quotes and a monte carlo simulation process employing stochastic differential equations using market volatilities and prices as inputs to create various commodity forward curves 
these simulated forward curves are then used to value various option contracts across a spectrum of commodities 
at december   the company had a short term asset of million and a short term liability of million  primarily as a result of de designating gas financial contracts 
these contracts were related to electric generation that was no longer probable 
during  the company recorded a decrease in earnings for the change in the market value of derivative instruments not meeting the normal purchase normal sale exception nor cash flow hedging criteria under sfas no 
of million compared to an increase in earnings of million for the decrease in primarily related to the reversal of prior period de designated gas financial hedges for electric generation 
at december   the company had a short term asset of million and a long term asset of million related to energy contracts designated as cash flow hedges that represent forward financial purchases of gas supply for electric generation of pse owned electric plants in future periods 
these contracts were designated as qualifying cash flow hedges and a corresponding unrealized gain of million  net of tax  was recorded in other comprehensive income 
of the amount in other comprehensive income  of the unrealized mark to market gain or million for the period january through april has been reclassified out of other comprehensive income to a deferred account in accordance with sfas no 
due to the company expecting to exceed the million cap for the pca mechanism 
if it is determined that it is uneconomical to run the plants in the future period  the hedging relationship is ended and the cash flow hedge is de designated and any unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the income statement 
gains and losses  when these de designated cash flow hedges are settled  are recognized in energy costs and are included as part of the pca mechanism 
due to high forward market prices at the end of december  unrealized gains have resulted in cash flow hedge assets for the period 
at december   the company also had a short term asset of million and a short term liability of million related to the cash flow hedge of gas contracts to serve natural gas customers 
in  natural gas prices increased partly due to disruptions in global supply therefore  existing gas financial hedges showed unrealized gains when marked to the higher market prices 
all mark to market adjustments relating to the natural gas business have been reclassified to a deferred account in accordance with sfas no 
due to the pga mechanism 
all increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply are passed on to customers with the pga mechanism 
as the gains and losses on the cash flow hedges are realized in future periods  they will be recorded as gas costs under the pga mechanism 
a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of natural gas and electricity would decrease the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges by million and would decrease current earnings for those contracts marked to market in earnings by an immaterial amount due to the pca mechanism 
energy derivative contracts gain loss dollars in millions amounts fair value of contracts outstanding at december  contracts realized or otherwise settled during changes in fair values of derivatives fair value of contracts outstanding at december  fair value of contracts with settlement during year source of fair value dollars in millions and thereafter total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk primarily through buying and selling electricity and gas to serve customers 
credit risk is the potential loss resulting from a counterparty s non performance under an agreement 
the company manages credit risk with policies and procedures for  among other things  counterparty analysis  exposure measurement  exposure monitoring  and exposure mitigation 
it is possible that extreme volatility in energy commodity prices could cause the company to have credit risk exposures with one or more counterparties 
if such counterparties fail to perform their obligations under one or more agreements  the company could suffer a material financial loss 
however  as of december   approximately of the counterparties comprising the sources of our energy portfolio are rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies and are either rated below investment grade or are not rated by rating agencies 
the company assesses credit risk internally for counterparties that are not rated 
interest rate risk the company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short term debt instruments  variable rate notes and leases and long term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements 
the company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt of various maturities 
the company utilizes bank borrowings  commercial paper  line of credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization to meet short term cash requirements 
these short term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable 
the company may enter into swap instruments or other financial hedge instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts 
the company did not have any swap instruments outstanding on fixed rate debt as of december  or  however from time to time the company may enter into treasury lock or forward starting swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure related to anticipated debt issuance 
the carrying amounts and the fair values of puget energy s debt instruments are dollars in millions carrying amount fair value carrying amount fair value financial liabilities short term debt long term debt fixed rate long term debt variable rate pse s carrying value and fair value of fixed rate long term debt in was the same as puget energy s debt 
pse s carrying value and fair value of both fixed rate and variable rate long term debt in was  million and  million  respectively 
in the second quarter  the company settled its two treasury lock contracts that originated in august the purpose of the treasury lock contracts was to hedge exposure to interest rate volatility for a debt offering of million that was completed in may since treasury interest rates related to the hedged debt decreased from the date of issuance of the treasury lock instruments  pse paid the counterparties million for the change in bond value when the contracts were settled 
in addition  the bonds issued associated with the treasury lock instruments had a correspondingly lower interest rate since treasury rates decreased from the date of issuance of the treasury lock instruments 
the treasury lock contracts were designated and documented under sfas no 
criteria as cash flow hedges  with all changes in market value for each reporting period being presented net of tax in other comprehensive income 
in the second quarter  the settlement loss on these instruments amounted to million  after tax  and was recorded as a loss in other comprehensive income 
in accordance with sfas no 
 this loss is being amortized out of other comprehensive income to current earnings as an increase to interest expense over the life of the new debt issued at an annual rate of approximately million pre tax 
the ending balance in other comprehensive income related to the treasury lock contracts at december  was a loss of million after tax and accumulated amortization 
in the second quarter  the company entered into two forward starting swap contracts to hedge against interest rate volatility for a debt offering anticipated to be performed in the second half of a forward starting swap is a financial arrangement between the company and a counterparty whereby one of the parties will be required to make a payment to the other party on a specific valuation date based upon the change in value of a designated treasury bond 
if interest rates rise related to the hedged debt from the date of issuance of the swap instruments  the company would receive a payment from the counterparty for the change in the bond value 
alternatively  if interest rates decreased related to the hedged debt from the date of issuance of the swap instruments  the company would pay the counterparty for the change in bond value 
these swap contracts were designated under sfas no 
criteria as cash flow hedges 
all financial hedge contracts of this type are reviewed by senior management and presented to the finance and budget committee of the board of directors  and are approved prior to execution 
at december   the unrealized gain associated with the two swap contracts was million after tax and is included in other comprehensive income 
the forward starting swap contracts will settle completely in a hypothetical decrease in the interest rate of a year treasury note would result in a loss of million net of tax in other comprehensive income 
the counterparties calculate the current market value for the existing forward swap positions based on market interest rates and swap rates as of december  treasury lock contracts gain loss dollars in millions amounts fair value of contracts outstanding at december  contracts realized or otherwise settled during changes in fair values of derivatives fair value of contracts outstanding at december
