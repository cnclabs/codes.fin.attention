effect of acquisitions of distributors as part of our strategy to increase distribution capacity we have acquired and will continue to acquire existing distributors  particularly in regions where we do not have a leading position 
the distributors we acquire are primarily involved in the vodka distribution business and are among the leading distributors in their regions 
over the past seven years  we have acquired distributors throughout poland 
typically  we purchase these distributors with cash and shares of our common stock 
for the twelve months ending december  these acquisitions have had a positive impact of on the results of the company accounting for approximately of our consolidated net sales and income

table of contents effect of acquisitions of production subsidiaries during  the company has expanded its acquisition strategy to vertically integrate into the production of alcoholic beverages by targeting leading distilleries with the leading premium and mainstream brands in poland 
the acquisition and integration of these businesses into our operations have had a significant effect on our results of operations 
the bols acquisition on august  the company completed a share sale agreement with takirra investment corporation  r my cointreau sa and botapol management sa an indirect subsidiary of r my cointreau to acquire of the outstanding capital stock of botapol holding bv  which itself owns of the outstanding capital stock of both bols  its principal operating subsidiary  and hillcroft sp

effect of exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations as a result of the issuance of the company s million senior secured notes due  we are exposed to foreign exchange movements 
movements in the eur polish zloty exchange rate will require us to revalue our liability on the senior secured notes accordingly  the impact of which will be reflected in the results of the company s operations 
in order to manage the cash flow impact of foreign exchange changes  the company has entered into certain hedge agreements 
as of december   the company had outstanding two hedge contracts for a seven year interest rate swap agreement 
the first swap agreement exchanged a fixed euro based coupon of  with a variable euro based coupon irs and the second swap exchanged the variable euro coupon to a variable polish zloty coupon cirs 
the net impact is a variable polish zloty based coupon amount based upon six month warsaw inter bank rate wibor applied to a notional amount of  million polish zloty 
as the cirs described above does not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  the mark to market valuation of the hedge as well as the revaluation of the senior secured notes are included in the results of operations 
because the company s functional currency is the polish zloty but its reporting currency is the us dollar  the translation effects of fluctuations in the exchange rate have impacted the company s financial condition and results of operations and have affected the comparability of our results between financial periods 
using period end national bank of poland exchange rates  which were used to translate the period end balance sheets  the exchange rate for the polish zloty as of december  was polish zloty per us dollar  compared to polish zloty per us dollar as of december

a substantial portion of these future capital expenditure amounts are discretionary  and we may adjust spending in any period according to our needs 
we currently intend to finance all of our capital expenditure through cash generated from operating activities 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years unaudited in thousands long term debt obligations interests on long term debts short term debt obligations operating leases capital leases total effects of inflation and foreign currency movements inflation in poland is projected at to for  compared to actual inflation of in the company s operating cash flows and substantially all of its assets are denominated in polish zloty 
this means that the company is exposed to translation movements both on its balance sheet and income statement 
the impact on working capital items is demonstrated on the cash flow statement as the movement in exchange on cash and cash equivalents 
the impact on the income statement is by the movement of the average exchange rate used to restate the income statement from polish zloty to us dollars 
the amounts shown as exchange rate gains or losses on the face of the income statement relate only to realized gains or losses on non polish zloty denominated transactions 
as a result of the issuance of the company s million senior secured notes due  we are exposed to foreign exchange movements 
movements in the eur polish zloty exchange rate will require us to revalue our liability on the senior secured notes  the impact of which will be reflected in the results of the company s operations 
in order to manage the cash flow impact of foreign exchange changes  the company has entered into certain hedge agreements 
as of december   the company had outstanding two hedge contracts for a seven year interest rate swap agreement 
the first swap agreements exchanged a fixed euro based coupon of  with a variable euro based coupon irs and the second swap exchanged the variable euro coupon to a variable polish zloty coupon cirs 
the net impact is a variable polish zloty based coupon amount based upon six month warsaw inter bank rate wibor applied to a notional amount of  million polish zloty 
as a result of this  movements in the underlying wibor rates will impact the results of our operations 
in addition as the cirs described above does not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  the mark to market valuation of the hedge will impact the results of operations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as at december   the exchange rate for the polish zloty versus the us dollar was  a change of from december  at which time the exchange rate was polish zloty per dollar 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of net sales  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents goodwill and intangibles following the introduction of sfas  acquired goodwill is no longer amortized 
instead the company assesses the recoverability of its goodwill at least once a year or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances or business climate indicate that expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges for individual business units may not be sufficient to support the recorded goodwill 
if undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to support the goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill based on the expected discounted cash flows of the business unit 
no such charge has been considered necessary through the date of the accompanying financial statements 
intangibles are amortized over their effective useful life 
in estimating fair value  management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows  future revenues  future earnings  and other factors 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record and impairment loss for the assets 
in connection with the bols and bialystok acquisitions  the company has acquired trademark rights to various brands  which were capitalized as part of the purchase price allocation process 
as these brands are well established they have been assed to have an indefinite life 
these trademarks rights will not be amortized  however  management assesses them at least once a year for impairment 
the calculation of the impairment charge for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  requires the use of estimates 
factoring in a deviation of for the discount rate as compared to management s estimate  there would still be no need for an impairment charge against goodwill 
accounting for business combinations the acquisition of businesses is an important element of the company s strategy 
we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas  business combinations  and allocate the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the determination of the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as associated asset useful lives  requires management to make estimates 
the company s acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  the value and estimated life of those assets may affect the amount of future period amortization expense for intangible assets with finite lives as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred 
the calculation of purchase price allocation requires judgment on the part of management in determining the valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
derivative instruments the company is exposed to market movements from changes in foreign currency exchange rates that could affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value 
the fair values of the company s derivative instruments can change with fluctuations in interest rates and or currency rates and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures 
the company s derivative instruments are held to hedge economic exposures 
the company follows internal policies to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks  including limitations on derivative market making or other speculative activities 

table of contents at the inception of a transaction the company documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective 
this process includes linking all derivatives designated to specific firm commitments or forecasted transitions 
the company also documents its assessment  both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis  of whether the derivative financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas r  share based payments  a revision of the prior sfas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
the statement offers a number of possibilities for implementation 
the sec has provided an extension to allow implementation during the first quarter of the company has elected to implement the modified prospective application  which will require the company to begin to recognize the impact of the change in january and will not require restatement of any prior periods 
the potential impact during is approximately  based upon current market conditions 
in may  fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections which replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and  accordingly  is required to be adopted by the company on january  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter sfas requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage be recorded as current period charges and that the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the company adopted sfas on january  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our operations are conducted primarily in poland and our functional currency is the polish zloty and the reporting currency is the us dollar 
our financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and receivable  inventories  bank loans  overdraft facilities and long term debt 
all of the monetary assets represented by these financial instruments are located in poland 
consequently  they are subject to currency translation risk when reporting in us dollars 
if the us dollar increases in value against the polish zloty  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses originally recorded in polish zloty will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against the polish zloty  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses originally recorded in polish zloty will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar can have a material impact on the value in us dollar of our non us dollar assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
our commercial foreign exchange exposure mainly arises from the fact that substantially all of our revenues are denominated in polish zloty  and our senior secured notes are denominated in euros
