item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business outlook we believe we ended fiscal year well positioned to continue increasing our sales and earnings in fiscal year during fiscal year  we implemented new merchandising and branding strategies at soffe that appear to be increasing brand recognition  as evidenced by the strong sell through of the soffe products at retail 
we continued to improve our manufacturing processes in the soffe business  which we hope will improve our margins and allow us to better serve our customers 
sell through of the junkfood product line at retail has also been solid  and we are seeing an increase in orders from several traditional customers for early fall delivery 
we continue to expand our junkfood product offerings in men s  boy s and children s apparel  which we believe will continue to grow our business in the future 
overall we are pleased with the fiscal year performance of our retail ready segment and are looking forward to continued sales growth and further improvement in operating margins in fiscal year over the past years  we have used the cash flow from our activewear segment to fund acquisitions to build our retail ready segment 
in fiscal year  we will be reinvesting in our activewear segment with the acquisition of fun tees 
and the opening of ceiba textiles  our offshore textile facility 
these two initiatives are expected to be key drivers in the future growth of our activewear segment 
we expect that the anticipated acquisition of fun tees will significantly increase our private label business by adding long term  well established relationships with national brands 
the customer relationships and off shore full package offerings are two key competencies of the fun tees operations  and were the driving factors in our decision to acquire the business 
we plan to migrate the fun tees fabric production into our current facilities  which is expected to improve the overall cost structure in our activewear segment 
on an annual basis we expect this acquisition to add approximately million in revenue  and once integrated  to improve the operating margins in our activewear segment 
the acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings in fiscal year  despite the costs associated with moving fabric production and equipment into our existing facilities 
we expect to see the results of the integration cost improvements in fiscal year we will not be acquiring any real property as a part of the funtees transaction  and do not anticipate there will be any goodwill recorded 
the acquisition of fun tees will increase our employee base by approximately two thousand personnel located in north carolina  alabama  mexico and el salvador 
in fiscal year  we are also beginning our off shore textile initiative in honduras 
with the recent passage of cafta  we believe it is important for us to take advantage of the opportunity to lower our fabric cost on basic products 
the building and utility infrastructure will be leased from the green valley industrial park 
we expect our capital expenditure for this project will be approximately million and will be incurred over three fiscal years 
the facility is expected to ultimately produce approximately one million pounds of fabric per week and is expected to reduce our cost by approximately million annually once at full production levels 
we are pleased to be able to reinvest in our activewear segment with the acquisition of fun tees and the opening of ceiba textiles  and look forward to realizing the additional sales and profits that these two initiatives should generate 
earnings guidance we will continue to issue earnings guidance of our sales and earnings expectations in fiscal year we have decided to change our earnings guidance to diluted earnings per share from the prior practice of issuing guidance based on basic earnings per share 
our earnings guidance includes the anticipated acquisition of fun tees on or around october  in addition  we expect to record an extraordinary gain in our first fiscal quarter associated with the final earn out payment made to the former m 
j 
soffe shareholders 
this anticipated extraordinary gain is also included in the earnings guidance for the first fiscal quarter and fiscal year guidance 
for the first fiscal quarter ending september   we expect sales to be in the range of to million and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this compares to our fiscal year first quarter sales of million and diluted earnings of per share 
for the fiscal year ending june   we expect sales to be in the range of to million and diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this compares to our fiscal year sales of million and diluted earnings of per share 

table of contents results of operations overview for the fiscal year  sales reached an all time record of million  an increase from million in sales in the prior year 
gross margins for the year improved basis points to compared to in the prior year driven from increased sales of the higher margin branded apparel products and improved manufacturing costs and lower raw material pricing 
this was offset partially by higher energy and transportation costs 
in fiscal year we began expensing stock option compensation costs in compliance with statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r 
during the year  we expensed approximately  in stock compensation related to our stock option plan that in prior years we would not have expensed 
in addition  we were required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act for fiscal year we estimate the cost expensed this year  including internal and external resources  as well as audit fees to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act  was approximately  or approximately earnings per share 
net income for the year ended july  was million  a increase from the prior year 
earnings were per basic share and per diluted share compared to per basic share and per diluted share in the prior year

we are presenting adjusted basic earnings per share for the fiscal year ended july  because we believe it provides a more complete understanding of our business results than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
the sale of our yarn spinning plant and the reversal of the foreign earnings tax liability are infrequent and unusual transactions 
we believe it is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of the business without the effect of these transactions

we improved our days sales outstanding  ending the year at days  compared to days at the end of fiscal year our inventories on july  were million  an increase of million from the prior year  primarily due to the junkfood acquisition

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the adequacy of receivable and inventory reserves  self insurance accruals and the accounting for income taxes 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  title has transferred to the customer  the price is fixed and determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales are recorded net of discounts and provisions for estimated returns and allowances 
we estimate returns and allowances on an ongoing basis by considering historical and current trends 
we record these costs as a reduction to net revenue 
we estimate the net collectibility of our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon this assessment 
specifically  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
significant changes in customer concentration or payment terms  deterioration of customer credit worthiness or weakening in economic trends could have a significant impact on the collectibility of receivables and our operating results 
inventories our inventory is carried at the lower of fifo cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for damaged  excess and out of style or otherwise obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical selling prices for these products and our estimated forecast of product demand for the next twelve months 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
self insurance our medical  prescription and dental care benefits are primarily self insured 
our self insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we develop estimates of claims incurred but not reported based upon the historical time it takes for a claim to be reported and historical claim amounts 
while the time it takes for a claim to be reported has been declining  if claims are greater than we originally estimate  or if costs increase beyond what we have anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and it could have a significant impact on our operating results 

table of contents share based compensation we adopted the fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  effective july  under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
we determine the fair value of each stock option at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
this model requires that we estimate a risk free interest rate  the volatility of the price of our common stock  the dividend yield  and the expected life of the options 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities measured by enacted tax rates 
we have recorded deferred tax assets for certain state operating loss carryforwards and nondeductible accruals 
we established a valuation allowance related to certain of the state operating loss carryforward amounts in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets if reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on earnings forecasts in the respective tax locations 
as of july   we had operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for state tax purposes 
the valuation allowance against the operating loss carryfowards was thousand at july  these carryforwards expire at various intervals through recent accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  inventory costs 
sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of converting work in process to finished goods be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted statement effective july  after review of our cost allocation procedures  we determined that the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fsp nos 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp  and  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp 
the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act was enacted on october  under guidance in fsp  the qualified production activities deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in fasb statement no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date of the jobs creation act 
we have determined that our production activities will qualify under the jobs creation act and expect that this deduction could reduce our effective income tax rate for fiscal year by up to 
fsp states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs creation act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas based on our analysis and evaluation of the impact of the repatriation provisions  we did not repatriate any foreign earnings pursuant to the jobs creation act 
on december   the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends fasb statement no 
 statements of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r is effective for annual periods beginning after june  accordingly  effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement r 
on november   the fasb issued staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
this provides for a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of share based compensation 
since our adoption of statement  we had not recorded any excess tax benefits associated with our stock options and therefore we had no initial pool of excess 
table of contents tax benefits upon adoption of statement r 
in march  the securities and exchange commission released sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment 
sab no 
provides the sec staff s position regarding the implementation of statement r 
sab no 
contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction between statement r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment transactions 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement r and sab no 
using the modified prospective transition method  therefore  prior periods have not been restated 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations interpretation  which is an interpretation of statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
interpretation clarifies terminology within sfas and requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
interpretation was effective for fiscal years ending after december  we evaluated our asset retirement obligations  determining we had no significant obligations with respect to conditional asset retirements 
accordingly  the adoption of interpretation did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
this statement requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas s retrospective application requirement replaces apb opinion no 
s  accounting changes  requirement to recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  effective july   we early adopted the accounting changes and corrections of errors provisions contained in statement for the year ended july   we determined that we had no accounting changes or corrections of errors that would be impacted by this statement 
accordingly  the adoption of statement did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes interpretation 
interpretation provides clarifying guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes and prescribes recognition and measurement guidance in determining amounts to be recorded in the financial statements 
this interpretation applies to all income based tax items and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect to adopt interpretation on july  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of interpretation will have on our financial position and results of operations but do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk sensitivity on january   in conjunction with the sale of our yarn spinning facility in edgefield  south carolina  we entered into a five year agreement with parkdale to supply our yarn requirements 
during this five year period  we will purchase from parkdale all yarn required by delta apparel and our wholly owned subsidiaries for use in our manufacturing operations excluding yarns that parkdale did not manufacture as of the date of the agreement in the ordinary course of its business or due to temporary parkdale capacity restraints 
the purchase price of yarn is based upon the cost of cotton plus a fixed conversion cost 
thus  we are subject to the commodity risk of cotton prices and cotton price movements which could result in unfavorable yarn pricing for us 
we fix the cotton prices as a component of the purchase price of yarn with parkdale  pursuant to the supply agreement  in advance of the shipment of finished yarn from parkdale 
prices are set according to prevailing prices  as reported by the new york cotton exchange  at the time we elect to fix specific cotton prices 
yarn with respect to which we have fixed cotton prices at july  was valued at million  and is scheduled for delivery between july and march at july   a decline in the market price of the cotton covered by our fixed price yarn would have had a negative impact of approximately million on the value of the yarn 
we may use derivatives  including cotton option contracts  to manage our exposure to movements in commodity prices 
we do not designate our options as hedge instruments upon inception 
accordingly  we mark to market changes in the fair market value of the options as other income or other expense in the statements of income 
we did not own any cotton options contracts on july  
table of contents interest rate sensitivity our credit agreements provide that the outstanding amounts owed shall bear interest at variable rates 
if the amount of outstanding indebtedness at july  under the revolving credit facilities had been outstanding during the entire year and the interest rate on this outstanding indebtedness were increased by basis points  our expense would have increased by approximately million  or  for the fiscal year 
this compares to an increase of million  or  for the fiscal year based on the outstanding indebtedness at july  the effect of a basis point increase in interest rates has a larger impact as of july  than as of july  due to the higher debt levels outstanding on july   resulting primarily from the acquisition of the junkfood business 
the actual increase in interest expense resulting from a change in interest rates would depend on the magnitude of the increase in rates and the average principal balance outstanding
