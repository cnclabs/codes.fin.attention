overview recent developments on september   we and starbucks corporation entered into an asset purchase agreement pursuant to which starbucks has agreed to purchase our leasehold interests in most of the locations where we operate retail stores under the diedrich coffee and coffee people brands  along with certain related fixtures and equipment  improvements  prepaid items  and ground lease improvements  and to assume certain liabilities as set forth in the asset purchase agreement 
pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  starbucks will pay us up to  in cash  which includes payment of  as consideration for our agreement to a non compete provision 
the actual amount paid by starbucks under the asset purchase agreement is dependent on which and how many of the company stores are ultimately transferred to starbucks 
ten percent of the amount paid to us upon transfer of the company stores will be deposited into an escrow fund to be held in connection with our indemnification obligations 
the closing is expected to occur approximately days after the date of the asset purchase agreement  provided that certain conditions  including that a specified minimum number of company stores are transferred to starbucks at closing  are met 
after the closing  we and starbucks have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer certain remaining company stores until approximately days after the date of the asset purchase agreement or such other longer period as agreed to by us and starbucks 

table of contents we and starbucks have made certain customary representations  warranties and covenants in the asset purchase agreement 
specifically  we have agreed that  subject to a fiduciary out provision and payment of a break up fee  we will not i take any action to solicit any proposal from  ii furnish any information to  or iii participate in any discussions with  any entity other than starbucks regarding any transaction involving the company stores 
upon termination of the asset purchase agreement under certain circumstances  including the company s entry into an alternative transaction involving the company stores  we shall pay starbucks actual fees and expenses incurred in connection with the transaction up to a maximum amount of  provided  however  that starbucks is entitled to a minimum of  regardless of its actual fees and expenses 
the asset purchase agreement also contains customary indemnification provisions for certain claims and provides for a basket of  and a cap of  for breaches of our representations and warranties contained in the asset purchase agreement 
the consummation of the transaction is subject to certain customary conditions  including approval of the transaction by our stockholders  a specified minimum number of company stores transferred to starbucks at closing  the receipt by starbucks of permits and approvals for at least of certain company stores that are transferred if the closing occurs within days of the date of the asset purchase agreement  receipt of lease extensions of at least years for at least of certain company stores that are transferred  and  receipt of consents to the assignment of the leases for each of the company stores that are transferred  with estoppel provisions being agreed to for at least of the company stores that are transferred 
the asset purchase agreement contains customary termination provisions and may be terminated by either us or starbucks if the closing does not occur within days from the date of the asset purchase agreement 
we may also terminate the asset purchase agreement if the closing has not occurred within days  provided that starbucks has not used commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the closing 
as part of the asset purchase agreement  we have agreed to a non compete provision that for three years after the closing restricts our ability to operate or have any interest in the ownership or operation of any entity operating any retail specialty coffee stores in any city where a company store is presently located 
the non compete provision applies only to stores opened after the date of the asset purchase agreement and does not apply to any retail stores operated under the gloria jean s brand name  wholesale sales to retail businesses that are not operated by us  or other non retail businesses  or the conversion of company operated stores existing on the date of the asset purchase agreement to franchise stores 
we have also agreed that we will not solicit any starbucks employee to enter our employment for three years after the closing 
business we are a specialty coffee roaster  wholesaler and retailer 
we sell brewed  espresso based and various blended beverages primarily made from our own fresh roasted premium coffee beans  as well as light food items  whole bean coffee and accessories  through our company operated and franchised retail locations 
we also sell whole bean and ground coffees on a wholesale basis in the office coffee service market and to other wholesale customers  including restaurant chains and other retailers 
we roast coffee at our coffee roasting facility in central california 
it supplies freshly roasted coffee to our company operated and franchised retail locations and to our wholesale accounts 
our brands include diedrich coffee  gloria jean s  and coffee people 
the diedrich coffee and coffee people brands are primarily company store operations and the gloria jean s brand is primarily a franchised store operation 
as of june   we owned and operated retail locations  of which up to retail locations may be sold to starbucks corporation as discussed in item recent developments  and overview recent developments in this item  and franchised other retail locations under these brands  for a total of retail coffee outlets 
our retail units are located in states 
as of june   we had over wholesale accounts with office coffee service distributors  chain and independent restaurants  and others 
although the specialty coffee industry is dominated by a single company with over  domestic locations  we are one of the nation s largest specialty coffee retailers 
our system wide revenues are more than million 
system wide revenues include sales from company operated and franchise locations 

table of contents we believe that our company is differentiated from other specialty coffee companies by the quality of our coffee products  the superior personalized customer service provided to our customers and the warm and friendly ambiance offered by our coffeehouses 
we serve our distinctively roasted coffee products in all of our brand locations and an extensive variety of fine quality flavored whole bean coffees are offered in our gloria jean s units 
our roasting recipes take into account the specific variety  origin and physical characteristics of each coffee bean to maximize its unique flavor 
key performance indicators we have several key indicators that we use to evaluate the performance of our business 
these include same store sales growth  the number of company operated and franchised stores opened and closed  and the measured relationship of cost of sales and related occupancy costs  operating expenses and general and administrative expenses to sales 
same store sales growth  or comparative sales growth  is a primary statistic used in the retail industry to measure core revenues 
this measure compares sales for all units open for one year or more to the comparable prior year period 
we use this measure to evaluate single coffeehouse  total brand  and total company sales performance 
until recently  comparable sales of our company operated stores and domestic franchised stores had declined  primarily as a result of aging stores  a lack of capital to fund store improvements  and no new store openings 
new stores typically achieve relatively strong comparative sales growth in their early years 
franchised units that are located in malls have also experienced declining sales due to overall declines in mall traffic 
our ability to open new company operated and franchise stores depends on our success in raising capital and selling franchises 
continuing declines in same store sales could result in store closures  make sales of franchises more difficult and have a material adverse impact on our future performance 
in addition  under a non compete provision in the asset purchase agreement with starbucks  we are restricted for a period of three years after the asset sale closes in our ability to open any new company operated or franchised diedrich coffee and coffee people coffeehouses in any city in which diedrich coffee or coffee people coffeehouses operated on the date that we and starbucks entered into the asset purchase agreement 
the non compete provision does not restrict our ability to open retail gloria jean s stores and does not apply to wholesale sales to retail businesses that are not operated by us or other non retail businesses or the conversion of our stores existing on the date of the asset purchase agreement to franchise stores 
see item recent developments  and overview recent developments in this item the number of operating units opened and closed is also a measure of the health of our brands and our business  although it is affected by a number of factors  including the availability of capital to finance growth 
in recent years the number of domestic units has declined because the number of aging units closing exceeded the number of new units opening 
company operated stores have deceased and franchised stores have increased 
unlike new company operated stores  new franchised stores do not require our capital 
in addition  franchised stores typically make an immediate profit contribution  whereas company stores generally are not profitable in the first year 
our near term growth plans focus primarily on franchising new domestic stores 
failure to successfully expand our franchise operations would materially adversely impact our future performance 
we use the relationship between cost of sales and related occupancy costs and operating expenses to sales to measure the operating efficiency of our individual coffeehouses and to measure the relationship between general and administrative expenses to sales to monitor and control the level of corporate overhead 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased in the current fiscal year due to the higher percentage of the higher cost keurig k cup business 
in total  wholesale sales which carry a higher costs of goods sold than retail sales  increased as a percentage of the total retail and wholesale sales mix 
cost of sales and related occupancy costs increased during fiscal as a result of a higher percentage of higher cost keurig business in the current year 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat compared to prior year 
general and administrative expenses have increased as a percentage of sales primarily due in part from increases in overhead costs not associated with retail and wholesale operations

ltd  formerly the gloria jean s master franchisee for australia  and certain of its affiliates collectively  jireh for  in cash and an additional  payable over the next six years under license  roasting and consulting agreements 
the sale resulted in a gain on the disposal of discontinued operations of  net of  in taxes 
the tax expense associated with the discontinued operations differed from the statutory federal effective tax rate primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance and permanently nondeductible goodwill associated with the discontinued operations 
the sale included immediate transfer of franchise rights to jireh of gloria jean s retail locations outside the us and puerto rico  including in australia 
after all payments have been made to us under the license  roasting and consulting agreements  all remaining gloria jean s trademarks  including those in the us  will be transferred to jireh 
concurrent with such future transfer  our us based gloria jean s subsidiary will enter into a perpetual  royalty free master franchise agreement with jireh under which we will continue to have exclusive rights to operate  franchise and develop gloria jean s locations throughout the us and puerto rico and to continue our wholesale operations under the gloria jean s coffees brand in these same markets 
we agreed to not compete internationally through our diedrich coffee and coffee people brands for a period of two years from the date of sale 
other than that restriction  our domestic gloria jean s outlets  our

on may   upon entering into the agreement  we immediately issued a  note under the facility  and used the proceeds of the note and other available cash to repay all outstanding debt with bank of the west bow

we also announced that we would exit our company operated diedrich and coffee people retail locations through the previously disclosed transaction with starbucks corporation 
while our management fully expects that the transaction with starbucks corporation will be completed  there are no absolute assurances that this will occur 
in the unlikely event that the transaction is not fully completed  the anticipated improvement in our cash flow and financial condition would reflect only the cost control measures initiated by us and any portion of the transaction that is completed

table of contents commitments and contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital leases including interest company operated retail locations and other operating leases franchise operated retail locations operating leases green coffee commitments we have also entered into employment agreements with two senior executive officers that provide for severance payments in the event that these individuals are terminated without cause or that they terminate their employment as a result of a constructive termination 
these severance payments range from six months to one year s salary 
our company s maximum liability for severance under the contracts is currently  because such amounts are contingent they have not been included in the above table 
we have obligations under non cancelable operating leases for our coffee houses  roasting facility and administrative offices 
lease terms are generally for to years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area and other operating costs 
some retail leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
in addition  we are liable on the master leases for gloria jean s franchise locations 
under our historical franchising business model  we executed the master leases for these locations  and entered into subleases on the same terms with our franchisees  which typically pay their rent directly to the landlords 
should any of these franchisees default on their subleases  we would be responsible for making payments thereunder 
our maximum theoretical future exposure at june   computed as the sum of all remaining lease payments through the expiration dates of the respective leases  was  this amount does not take into consideration any mitigating measures that we could take to reduce this exposure in the event of default  including re leasing the locations or terminating the master lease by negotiating a lump sum payment to the landlord that is less than the sum of all remaining future rents and other amounts payable 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
accounts significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  franchise receivables  allowance for bad debt reserves  fixed asset lives  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  self insurance and workers compensation reserves  store closure reserves  stock based compensation  the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets and contingencies

 we evaluate the carrying value of individual stores when the operating results have reasonably progressed to a point to adequately evaluate the probability of continuing operating losses or a current expectation that a store will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in making these judgments  we consider the period of time since the store was opened or remodeled  and the trend of operations and expectations for future sales growth 
for stores selected for review  we estimate the future cash flows from operating the store over its estimated useful life 
we make judgments about future same store sales and the operating expenses and estimated useful life that we would expect with such level of same store sales 
the most significant assumptions in our analysis are those used when we estimate a unit s future cash flows 
we generally use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on unit specific information 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating unit assets may be overstated or understated 
impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever an event or circumstance indicates that impairment has likely occurred 
we consider the reporting unit level to be the segment level since the components within each segment have similar economic characteristics  including products and services  production processes  types or classes of customers and distribution methods 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the segment 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows or valuations of similar businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future net cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we consider historical results as well as the assumptions utilized in our strategic plan for items such as same store sales  store count growth rates  and the discount rate we consider to be the market discount rate used for acquisitions of similar businesses 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the segments may ultimately prove to be significantly higher or lower  thereby causing the carrying value to be less than or to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has or has not occurred 
if our assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our goodwill may be understated or overstated 
our annual impairment measurement date is our fiscal year end 
estimated liability for closing stores we make decisions to close stores based on prospects for estimated future profitability and sometimes we are forced to close stores due to circumstances beyond our control eg  a landlord s refusal to negotiate a new 
table of contents lease 
our management team evaluates each store s performance every period 
when stores continue to perform poorly  we consider the demographics of the location  as well as the likelihood of being able to improve the performance of an unprofitable store 
based on the management team s judgment  we estimate the future net cash flows 
if we determine that the store will not  within a reasonable period of time  operate at break even cash flow or be profitable  and we are not contractually obligated to continue operating the store  we may close the store 
additionally  franchisees may close stores for which we are the primary lessee 
if the franchisee cannot make payments on the lease  we continue making the lease payments and establish an estimated liability for the closed store if we decide not to operate it as a company operated store 
effective january   we establish the estimated liability on the actual closure date which is generally the date on which we cease to receive economic benefit from the unit 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  on january   we established the estimated liability when we identified a store for closure  which may or may not have been the actual closure date 
we also review the net cash flows to determine the need to provide for asset impairment 
the estimated liability for closing stores on properties vacated is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee that we expect to pay  as well as the estimated maintenance costs that we expect to pay until the lease has been abated 
the amount of the estimated liability is generally the present value of the estimated future payments 
the interest rate used to calculate the present value of these liabilities is based on our incremental borrowing rate at the time the liability is established 
the related discount is amortized and shown in provision for asset impairment and restructuring costs or cost of sales and related occupancy  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing stores is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant stores  which we determine based on our assessment of our ability to successfully negotiate early terminations of our lease agreements with the lessors or to sublease the property 
additionally  we estimate the cost to maintain leased and owned vacant properties until the lease has been abated 
if the costs to maintain properties increase  or it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties or sublease or terminate leases  we may need to record additional estimated liabilities 
if the leases on the vacant stores are not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liabilities  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the leases on the vacant stores are terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liabilities  we reverse previously established estimated liabilities through the line item in which it was originally recorded  resulting in an increase in operating income 
estimated liability for self insurance and workers compensation we are self insured for a portion of our current year s losses related to workers compensation insurance 
we have obtained stop loss insurance for individual workers compensation claims with a  deductible per occurrence and a program maximum for all claims of  insurance liabilities and reserves are accounted for based on the present value of actuarial estimates of the amount of incurred and unpaid losses  based approximately on a risk free interest rate 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of historical claim loss development 
management  in determining the estimated liability  bases the assumptions on the average historical losses on claims we have incurred 
the actual loss development may be better or worse than the development we estimated in conjunction with the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the reserve 
as a result  if we experience a higher than expected number of claims or the costs of claims are greater than expected  then we may adjust the expected losses upward and our future self insurance expenses will rise 
franchised operations we monitor the financial condition of certain franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make their required payments to us 
each period we perform an analysis to develop estimated bad debts for each franchisee 
we then compare the aggregate result 
table of contents of that analysis to the amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements as the allowance for doubtful accounts and adjust the allowance as appropriate 
over time  our assessment of individual franchisees may change 
for instance  we have had franchisees for whom we had estimated a loss equal to the total amount of their receivable  who have paid us in full or established a consistent record of payments generally one year such that we determined an allowance was no longer required 
depending on the facts and circumstances  there are a number of different actions we or our franchisees may take to resolve franchise collections issues 
these actions may include the purchase of franchise stores by us or by other franchisees  a modification to the franchise agreement  which may include a provision to defer certain royalty payments or reduce royalty rates in the future  a restructuring of the franchisee s business or finances including the restructuring of leases for which we are the primary or secondary obligee or  if necessary  the termination of the franchise agreement 
the allowance established is based on our assessment of the most probable course of action that will occur 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which we adopted on january   an estimated liability for future lease obligations on stores operated by franchisees for which we are the primary or secondary obligee is established on the date the franchisee closes the store 
also  we record an estimated liability for subsidized lease payments when we sign a sublease agreement committing us to the subsidy 
the amount of the estimated liability is established using the methodology described in estimated liability for closing stores above 
consistent with sfas no 
 we have not established an additional estimated liability for potential losses not yet incurred 
if sales trends or economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised stores 
in addition  entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future 
stock based compensation as discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have various stock based compensation plans that provide options for certain employees and outside directors to purchase common shares of stock 
prior to june   we elected to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which utilizes the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation  as opposed to using the fair value method prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
because of this election  we were required to make certain disclosures of pro forma net income assuming we had adopted sfas no 
starting june   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  which sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees and non employee directors  including employee stock purchase plans  and requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation 
we determine the estimated fair value of stock based compensation on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including our historical stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for analysis of the effect of certain changes in assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation 
valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets and contingencies as discussed above  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
if we have been profitable for a number of years and our prospects for the realization of our deferred tax assets are 
table of contents more likely than not  we would then reverse our valuation allowance and credit income tax expense 
in assessing the prospects for future profitability  many of the assessments of same store sales and cash flows discussed above become relevant 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized from future taxable income 
as of june   our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance totaled approximately  new accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt the new requirements in our fiscal first quarter of the cumulative effects  if any  of adopting fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
other matters seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations as well as economic trends that affect retailers in general 
historically  our net sales have not been realized proportionately in each quarter  with net sales being the highest during the second fiscal quarter  which includes the november december holiday season 
hot weather tends to negatively impact sales 
quarterly results are also affected by the timing of the opening of new stores  which may not occur as anticipated due to events outside our control 
as a result of these factors  and of the other contingencies and risk factors described elsewhere in this report  the financial results for any individual quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved in a full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive items entered into for trading purposes none 
market risk sensitive items entered into for other than trading purposes we have exposure to market risk from two primary sources interest rate risk and commodity price risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our outstanding bank debt 
at june   we had a  note facility with no outstanding balance  which could be affected by changes in short term interest rates 
at fiscal year end  the interest rate was 
commodity price risk green coffee  the principal raw material for our products  is subject to significant price fluctuations caused by a number of factors  including weather  political  and economic conditions 
to date  we have not used 
table of contents commodity based financial instruments to hedge against fluctuations in the price of green coffee 
to ensure that we have an adequate supply of green coffee  however  we enter into agreements to purchase green coffee in the future that may or may not be fixed as to price 
at june   we had commitments to purchase coffee through fiscal year  totaling  for  pounds of green coffee  the majority of which were fixed as to price 
the coffee scheduled to be delivered to us in fiscal year pursuant to these commitments will satisfy approximately of our anticipated green coffee requirements for the fiscal year 
assuming we require approximately  additional pounds of green coffee during fiscal for which no price has yet been fixed  each per pound increase in the price of green coffee could result in  of additional cost 
however  because the price we pay for green coffee is negotiated with suppliers  we believe that the commodity market price for green coffee would have to increase significantly  by as much as per pound  before suppliers would increase the price they charge us
