item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see the cautionary statement above and risk factors under item a for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our fiscal year end financial reporting periods are a or week year ending on the saturday closest to december st 
fiscal had weeks and ended on december  fiscal had weeks and ended on january  fiscal had weeks with the extra week occurring in the fourth quarter of the year and ended on january  overview we design and develop proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal integrated circuits ics for a broad range of applications 
our innovative ics can dramatically reduce the cost  size and system power requirements of the products that our customers sell 
we currently offer ics that can be incorporated into communications devices  such as wireless phones and modems  as well as cable and satellite set top boxes  residential communication gateways for cable or digital subscriber line dsl  fm broadcast radio tuners and networking equipment 
we also offer a family of bit microcontrollers mcus for use in a broad array of applications such as industrial automation and control  automotive sensors and controls  medical instrumentation  and electronic test and measurement equipment 
our major customers include advanced digital broadcast  agere systems  apple  conexant  intel  lg electronics  motorola  sagem  samsung and thomson 
our company was founded in our business has grown since our inception  as reflected by our employee headcount  which increased to at the end of fiscal  from employees at the end of fiscal and employees at the end of fiscal as a fabless semiconductor company  we rely on third party semiconductor fabricators in asia  and to a lesser extent the united states  to manufacture the silicon wafers that reflect our ic designs 
each wafer contains numerous die  which are cut from the wafer to create a chip for an ic 
we rely on third parties in asia to assemble  package  and  in the substantial majority of cases  test these devices and ship these units to our customers 
we also rely on third party providers of software to supply a complete aerofone mobile handset solution to our customers 
we have increased the portion of testing performed by such third parties  which facilitates faster delivery of products to our customers particularly those located in asia  shorter production cycle times  lower inventory requirements  lower costs and increased flexibility of test capacity 
our product set has expanded to a broad portfolio targeting mobile handset and broad based mixed signal applications 
our expertise in analog intensive  high performance  mixed signal ics enables us to develop highly differentiated solutions that address multiple markets 
for example  our silicon direct access arrangement daa product family is optimized for the personal computer pc modem market  our isomodem family of embedded modems has been widely adopted by satellite set top box manufacturers  and our aero gsm gprs transceiver family is being shipped in mobile handsets worldwide 
we continue to introduce next generation ics with added functionality and further integration 
in april  we introduced a family of fm broadcast radio tuner products and a family of digital power products 
in august  we introduced families of oscillators xos and voltage controlled oscillators vcxos 
in september  we introduced the aero iie single chip edge transceiver and the fax isomodem embedded modem 
in october  we introduced the aerofone single chip phone and the quad proslic 
in november  we introduced the sirx satellite receivers 
through acquisitions and internal development efforts  we have continued to further diversify our product portfolio 
we plan to continue to diversify our product portfolio by introducing products that increase the content we provide for existing applications and by introducing ics for markets we do not currently address  thereby expanding our total available market opportunity 
we group our products into two categories  mobile handset products and broad based mixed signal products 
mobile handset products include our aero transceivers  the aerofone single chip phone  power amplifiers  and to the extent incorporated into handsets  fm broadcast radio tuners 
broad based mixed signal products include our silicon daa  isomodem embedded modems  proslic telephony interface circuits  microcontroller products  dsl analog front end  siphy optical physical layer transceivers  precision clock data recovery ics cdrs  xm satellite radio tuner  digital power products  fm broadcast radio tuners for non handset applications  oscillators xos  voltage controlled oscillators vcxos  general purpose rf synthesizers and sirx satellite receivers 
during fiscal  and  one customer  samsung  represented  and of our revenues  respectively 
no other single end customer accounted for more than of our revenues in any of these years 
in addition to direct sales to customers  some of our end customers purchase products indirectly from us through distributors and contract manufacturers 
an end customer purchasing through a contract manufacturer typically instructs such contract manufacturer to obtain our products and incorporate such products with other components for sale by such contract manufacturer to the end customer 
although we actually sell the products to  and are paid by  the distributors and contract manufacturers  we refer to such end customer as our customer 
two of our distributors  edom technology and uniquest  each selling products to customers in asia  represented and of our fiscal revenues  respectively 
edom and uniquest represented and of our fiscal revenues  respectively  and edom accounted for of our total revenues during fiscal there were no other distributors or contract manufacturers that accounted for more than of our revenues in fiscal years  or the percentage of our revenues derived from customers located outside of the united states was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal this percentage increase in the two most recent years reflects our product and customer diversification and increased market penetration for our products  as many of our mobile handset  and increasingly  broad based mixed signal customers manufacture and design their products in asia 
all of our revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
we believe that a majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from customers outside of the united states 
the sales cycle for the test and evaluation of our ics can range from one month to months or more 
an additional three to six months or more are usually required before a customer ships a significant volume of devices that incorporate our ics 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we typically experience a significant delay between incurring expenses for research and development and selling  general and administrative efforts  and the generation of corresponding sales 
consequently  if sales in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our operating results for that quarter and  potentially  future quarters would be adversely affected 
moreover  the amount of time between initial research and development and commercialization of a product  if ever  can be substantially longer than the sales cycle for the product 
accordingly  if we incur substantial research and development costs without developing a commercially successful product  our operating results  as well as our growth prospects  could be adversely affected 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer products such as pcs  personal video recorders  set top boxes and mobile handsets  we expect that the demand for our products will be typically subject to some degree of seasonal demand resulting in increased sales in the third and fourth quarters of each year when customers place orders to meet holiday demand 
however  rapid changes in our markets and across our product areas make it difficult for us to accurately estimate the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
the following describes the line items set forth in our consolidated statements of income revenues 
revenues are generated almost exclusively by sales of our ics 
we recognize revenue on sales when all of the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales direct to customers and contract manufacturers upon shipment 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on products unsold by distributors 
accordingly  we defer the revenue and cost of revenue on such sales until the distributors sell the product to the end customer 
our products typically carry a one year replacement warranty 
replacements have been insignificant to date 
our revenues are subject to variation from period to period due to the volume of shipments made within a period and the prices we charge for our products 
the vast majority of our revenues were negotiated at prices that reflect a discount from the list prices for our products 
these discounts are made for a variety of reasons  including to establish a relationship with a new customer  as an incentive for customers to purchase products in larger volumes  to provide profit margin to our distributors who resell our products or in response to competition 
in addition  as a product matures  we expect that the average selling price for such product will decline due to the greater availability of competing products 
our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to ship larger volumes of those products in response to such demand  as well as our ability to develop or acquire new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes the cost of purchasing finished silicon wafers processed by independent foundries  costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of those products  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  logistics and quality assurance  costs of software royalties and amortization of purchased software  other intellectual property license costs  and certain acquired intangible assets  an allocated portion of our occupancy costs  allocable depreciation of testing equipment and leasehold improvements  and impairment charges related to certain manufacturing equipment held for sale or abandoned  and  for prior periods  a portion of the settlement costs associated with the tdk patent infringement lawsuit 
generally  we depreciate equipment over four years on a straight line basis and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the applicable lease term 
recently introduced products tend to have higher cost of revenues per unit due to initially low production volumes required by our customers and higher costs associated with new package variations 
generally  as production volumes for a product increase  unit production costs tend to decrease as our yields improve and our semiconductor fabricators  assemblers and test suppliers achieve greater economies of scale for that product 
additionally  the cost of wafer procurement and assembly and test services  which are significant components of cost of goods sold  vary cyclically with overall demand for semiconductors and our suppliers available capacity of such products and services 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation  including stock compensation  and related costs of employees engaged in research and development activities  new product mask  wafer  packaging and test costs  external consulting and services costs  amortization of purchased software  equipment tooling  equipment depreciation  amortization of acquired intangible assets  acquired research and development  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs for such operations 
we generally depreciate our research and development equipment over four years and amortize our purchased software from computer aided design tool vendors over three to four years 
research and development activities include the design of new products and software  refinement of existing products and design of test methodologies to ensure compliance with required specifications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  including stock compensation  related allocable portion of our occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  applications engineering support  professional fees  directors and officers liability insurance  patent litigation legal fees  other promotional and marketing expenses  and reserves for bad debt 
write off of in process research development 
write off of in process research development reflects the write off of in process research and development costs which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of cygnal in fiscal interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
we generally invest in tax exempt short term investments 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest on our short and long term obligations 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net primarily reflects our share of income and losses related to our equity investments and the gain on the disposal of fixed assets 
provision for income taxes 
we accrue a provision for domestic and foreign income tax at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  research and development tax credits and interest income from tax exempt short term investments 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  january  january  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative write off of in process research development operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues year ended december  january  change change in millions mobile handsets broad based mixed signal total mobile handsets the decline in the sales of our mobile handset products in fiscal was primarily driven by declining average selling prices of our aero transceiver family of products 
average selling prices in mobile handset products decreased year over year by 
this decrease was offset in part by a year over year increase in unit volumes of our mobile handset products 
broad based mixed signal the growth in the sales of our broad based mixed signal products in fiscal was primarily driven by increased revenues from our proslic products reflecting growth in demand and market share gains in the voip market  and microcontroller products  a business that we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal such growth was offset in part by a decline in revenue from our modem products consisting of our daa and isomodem products due to declines in average selling prices and unit volumes 
unit volumes of broad based mixed signal products increased year over year by 
in addition  average selling prices in this area increased year over year by 
as our products become more mature  we expect to experience decreases in average selling prices in the future 
our revenues will be dependent on our ability to increase sales volumes and introduce higher priced  next generation products and product extensions 
gross profit year ended december  january  change change in millions gross profit percent of revenue the year over year decrease in gross profit dollars in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in revenues from our mobile handset products 
we expect to experience declines in the average selling prices of our mobile handset products and certain of our broad based mixed signal products  especially with respect to our modem products 
this downward pressure on gross profit as a percentage of revenues may be offset to the extent we are able to introduce higher margin new products and continue to gain market share with our broad based mixed signal ics  or achieve lower production costs from our wafer foundries and third party assembly and test sub contractors 
research and development year ended december  january  change change in millions research and development percent of revenue the year over year increase in research and development expense in fiscal was principally due to a million charge for acquired research and development costs in connection with our acquisition of silicon magike  increased staffing and associated occupancy and other costs to pursue new product development opportunities  and to continue to develop software and new testing methodologies for newly introduced and existing products 
some of our more significant development projects in the mobile handset product area included the aerofone single chip phone  the aero iie single chip edge transceiver and the fm broadcast radio tuners for handsets 
significant development projects in the broad based mixed signal product area included families of oscillators xos and voltage controlled oscillators vcxos  the fax isomodem embedded modem  digital power products and the sirx satellite receivers 
all of these development projects have either been completed or are scheduled to be completed over the next twelve months 
additionally  many of these new products are being sampled by certain of our customers and are in the design in phase 
with the exception of the fm broadcast radio tuners  we don t expect the products derived from these projects to begin to contribute to revenues in a meaningful way before late fiscal excluding the million charge for acquired research and development costs in connection with the acquisition of silicon magike  we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our staffing and associated costs to pursue additional new product development opportunities  and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues due to changes in sales and the timing of certain expensive items related to new product development initiatives  such as engineering mask and wafer costs 
we also expect research and development expense to increase in future periods due to our adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas revised  share based payment  sfas r 
we identified and valued three research and development projects in connection with the acquisition of silicon magike  including voice  high voltage and other power related technologies 
at the date of acquisition  the acquired technology had no alternative future use and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
we estimate that these projects ranged from to complete at the time of the acquisition 
the remaining research and development efforts include layout  mask set  integration and testing the product 
the significant risks associated with the successful completion of these projects include our potential inability to finish the complex designs  produce sample versions of the integrated circuits which operate at the required technical specifications  and gain customer acceptance of the parts 
failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could result in lost revenues 
completion costs to date on all projects have been consistent with estimates made at the time of the acquisition 
the estimated cost to complete these projects was expected to be approximately million in the aggregate as of december  the company doesn t expect the products derived from these technologies to begin to contribute to revenues prior to fiscal selling  general and administrative year ended december  january  change change in millions selling  general and administrative percent of revenue the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was principally attributable to an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs resulting from the geographical expansion of our sales support organization in asia and europe  million in charges related to the separation agreement with our former chief executive officer  million in charges related to the search and hiring costs of our current chief executive officer  and an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs related to the expansion of our internal information technology and services support organization 
the increase was offset in part by a million decline in sales commissions and bonuses due to a decline in our sales 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to expand our sales channels  marketing applications efforts and administrative infrastructure 
in addition  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues because of potential significant variability in our future revenues  increased support costs related to new product introduction  and fluctuating legal costs related to litigation and intellectual property matters 
we also expect selling  general and administrative expense to increase in future periods due to our adoption of sfas r 
interest income year ended december  january  change in millions interest income the increase in the dollar amount of interest income in fiscal was due to a greater amount of cash and short term investments balances during the year ended december  and due to an increase in the interest rates of the underlying instruments during fiscal interest expense interest expense was million in both fiscal and other income expense  net year ended december  january  change in millions other income expense  net other income expense  in fiscal primarily reflected gains on the sale of test equipment 
no comparable gains occurred in fiscal provision for income taxes year ended december  january  change in millions provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than fiscal  primarily due to the tax savings from alignment of our financial structure with our international operational structure  as well as an increase in tax exempt interest income 
the decrease was offset by the fiscal non deductible acquired research and development costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of silicon magike 
the impact of the non deductible acquired research and development costs was 
excluding this charge  the tax rate would have been 
we don t currently anticipate a significant change to this adjusted tax rate in fiscal in addition  the effective tax rates for each of the periods presented differ from the federal statutory rate of due to the amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate may be lower than the federal statutory rate  the impact of research and development tax credits  tax exempt interest income and other permanent items 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues year ended january  january  change change in millions mobile handsets broad based mixed signal total the year over year increase in revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to significant growth in both our mobile handset and broad based mixed signal product groups 
mobile handsets growth in the sales of our mobile handset products in fiscal were driven by increased unit volumes of our aero transceiver family of products reflecting the increased demand and market share gains driven largely by asian mobile handset customers 
unit volumes of our mobile handset products increased year over year by 
in addition  average selling prices in this area increased year over year by 
broad based mixed signal growth in the sales of our broad based mixed signal products in fiscal were primarily driven by increased unit volumes of our isomodems reflecting growth in demand and market share gains primarily in the set top box and personal video recorder market  microcontrollers  a new business that we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal which contributed revenues of million in fiscal  proslics reflecting growth in demand and market share gains in the voice over internet protocol voip market  and daas reflecting growth in demand in voice applications  such as voip  and modems for personal computers 
unit volumes of broad based mixed signal products increased year over year by 
in addition  average selling prices in this area increased year over year by reflecting the change in mix in this area towards higher priced items 
gross profit year ended january  january  change change in millions gross profit percent of revenue the year over year increase in gross profit dollars for fiscal was primarily due to the substantial increase in sales volumes in both our mobile handset and broad based mixed signal product groups 
the increase in gross profit percentage in fiscal was primarily due to the absence of any significant one time charges such as the million charge associated with a patent litigation settlement recorded in fiscal research and development year ended january  january  change change in millions research and development percent of revenue the year over year increase in research and development expense for fiscal was principally due to increased staffing  including personnel related to our acquisition of cygnal  and associated occupancy and other costs to pursue new product development opportunities  and to continue to develop new testing methodologies for newly introduced and existing products 
selling  general and administrative year ended january  january  change change in millions selling  general and administrative percent of revenue the increase in the dollar amount of selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal was principally attributable to an increase of approximately million for sales commissions and bonuses associated with our increased revenue levels  an increase of approximately million for personnel associated with our acquisition of cygnal  an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs related to the expansion of our internal information technology and services support organization  an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs associated with the geographical expansion of our sales support organization in asia and europe  an increase of approximately million in legal  consulting and auditing fees which were primarily driven by activities related to the establishment of a headquarters for non us operations in singapore and compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  and an increase of approximately million for increased staffing and associated costs related to product marketing and marketing applications activities associated with our mobile handset products 
write off of in process research development year ended january  january  change in millions write off of in process research development we wrote off in process research and development in fiscal related to our acquisition of cygnal 
we did not have any such write offs in fiscal interest income year ended january  january  change in millions interest income the increase in the dollar amount of interest income was due to a greater amount of cash and short term investments balances during the year ended january  and due to an increase in the interest rates of the underlying instruments during fiscal interest expense year ended january  january  change in millions interest expense the increase in the dollar amount of interest expense in the most recent period was due to accrued interest associated with software license agreements 
other income expense  net year ended january  january  change in millions other income expense  net the increase in the dollar amount of other income for the most recent period was primarily due to gains on the sale of test equipment 
provision for income taxes year ended january  january  change in millions provision for income taxes effective tax rate the effective tax rates differ from the federal statutory rate of due to the impact of research and development tax credits  state taxes  tax exempt interest income and other permanent items 
business outlook we expect revenues in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
furthermore  we expect our diluted net income per share to be in the range of to 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity as of december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our short term investments consist primarily of corporate and us government agency debt securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal operating cash flows during fiscal reflect our net income of million  adjustments for depreciation  amortization  acquired research and development  and tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options of million  and a net decrease in the components of our working capital of million 
net cash provided by investing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash used of million during fiscal the increase was principally due to an increase of million in net sales and maturities of short term investments  offset by a million increase in net purchases of property  equipment and software and other assets  including a million payment related to the acquisition of silicon magike 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately to million for fiscal additionally  as part of our growth strategy  we expect to evaluate opportunities to invest in or acquire other businesses  intellectual property or technologies that would complement or expand our current offerings  expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal  compared to net cash provided of million during fiscal the increase in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal was principally due to higher proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
in our day to day business activities  we incur certain commitments to make future payments under contracts such as leases  purchase orders and other long term contracts 
maturities under these contracts are set forth in the following table as of december   in thousands payments due by period total thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations operating lease obligations include amounts for leased facilities 
purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders with suppliers where there is a fixed non cancelable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  the timing and extent of research and development projects  potential acquisitions of companies or technologies and the expansion of our sales and marketing activities 
we believe our existing cash and short term investment balances are sufficient to meet our capital requirements through at least the next months  although we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues and cost of revenues on sales to distributors  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past their contractual due date  the current business environment  and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future 
inventory valuation we assess the recoverability of inventories through an on going review of inventory levels in relation to sales history  backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
to address the difficult  subjective and complex area of judgment in determining appropriate inventory valuation in a consistent manner  we apply a set of methods  assumptions and estimates to arrive at the net inventory amount by completing the following first  we identify any inventory that has been previously written down in prior periods 
this inventory remains written down until sold  destroyed or otherwise disposed of 
second  we write down the inventory line items that may be slow moving or have some form of obsolescence due to non conformance with electrical and mechanical standards as identified by our quality assurance personnel 
third  the remaining inventory not otherwise identified to be written down is compared to an assessment of product shipment history and forecasted demand  typically over the last six months and next six months  or actual firm backlog on hand 
however  microcontroller product history and forecasted demand is typically measured over the last twelve months and next twelve months  respectively  due to the breadth of customers and markets served and longer product life cycles 
finally  the result of this methodology is compared against the product life cycle and competitive situations in the marketplace driving the outlook for the consumption of the inventory and the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those that we project 
in the event that actual demand is lower or market conditions are worse than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including fixed assets and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
occasionally  we may hold certain assets for sale 
in those cases  the assets are reclassified on our balance sheet from long term to current  and the carrying value of such assets are reviewed and adjusted each period thereafter to the fair value less expected cost to sell 
we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares our fair value to our net book value 
in determining fair value  the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  the second step of the analysis compares the implied fair value of our goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income loss for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
further  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and could result in additional assessments of income tax 
we believe adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options 
under the new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statement of income 
we expect to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock based awards 
sfas r requires companies to use either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method 
we intend to use the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted  modified or settled after the adoption date as well as for any awards that were granted prior to the adoption date for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered 
sfas r was originally effective for reporting periods that began after june  in april  the sec announced the adoption of a new rule allowing companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year that begins after june  we intend to adopt sfas r at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a significant negative impact on our results of operations  but will not impact our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after tax returns on our investment portfolio 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments holdings as of december   an immediate one percentage point decline in the yield for such instruments would decrease our annual interest income by approximately million 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in the duration of our investments and the credit quality of the investments we hold
