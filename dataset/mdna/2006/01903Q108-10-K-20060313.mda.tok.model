overview as a business development company  we are in the private equity business 
specifically  we provide long term debt and equity investment capital to companies in a variety of industries 
our lending and investment activity has generally been focused on private finance and commercial real estate finance  which included primarily the investment in non investment grade commercial mortgage backed securities  which we refer to as cmbs  and collateralized debt obligation bonds and preferred shares  which we refer to as cdos 
on may   we completed the sale of our portfolio of cmbs and real estate related cdo investments 
upon the completion of this transaction  our lending and investment activity has been focused primarily on private finance investments 
our private finance activity principally involves providing financing to middle market us companies through privately negotiated long term debt and equity investment capital 
our financing is generally used to fund growth  acquisitions  buyouts  recapitalizations  note purchases  bridge financings  and other types of financings 
we generally invest in private companies though  from time to time  we may invest in companies that are public but lack access to additional public capital 
our investment objective is to achieve current income and capital gains 
our portfolio composition at december    and  was as follows private finance commercial real estate finance our earnings depend primarily on the level of interest and dividend income  fee and other income  and net realized and unrealized gains or losses on our investment portfolio after deducting interest expense on borrowed capital  operating expenses and income taxes  including excise tax 
interest income results from the stated interest rate earned on a loan or debt security and the amortization of loan origination fees and discounts 
the level of interest income is directly related to the balance of the interest bearing investment portfolio outstanding during the year multiplied by the weighted average yield 
our ability to generate interest income is dependent on economic  regulatory  and competitive factors that influence new investment activity  interest rates on the types of loans we make  the level of repayments in the portfolio  the amount of loans and debt securities for which interest is not accruing and our ability to secure debt and equity capital for our investment activities 
because we are a regulated investment company for tax purposes  we intend to distribute substantially all of our annual taxable income as dividends to our shareholders

the weighted average yield is computed as of the balance sheet date 
our investment activity is focused on making long term investments in the debt and equity of primarily private middle market companies 
debt investments may include senior loans  unitranche debt a single debt investment that is a blend of senior and subordinated debt  or subordinated debt with or without equity features 
the junior debt that we invest in that is lower in repayment priority than senior debt is also known as mezzanine debt 
equity investments may include a minority equity stake in connection with a debt investment or a substantial equity stake in connection with a buyout transaction 
in a buyout transaction  we generally invest in senior and or subordinated debt and equity preferred and or voting or non voting common where our equity ownership represents a significant portion of the equity  but may or may not represent a controlling interest 
in addition  we may fund most or all of the debt and equity capital upon the closing of certain buyout transactions  which may include investments in lower yielding senior debt 
subsequent to the closing  the portfolio company may refinance all or a portion of the lower yielding senior debt  which would reduce our investment 
repayments include repayments of senior debt funded by us that was subsequently refinanced or repaid by the portfolio companies 
we intend to take a balanced approach to private equity investing that emphasizes a complementary mix of debt investments and buyout investments 
the combination of these two types of investments provides current interest and related portfolio income and the potential for future capital gains 
recently  we have seen junior debt financing opportunities in the market that we believe are unattractive from a risk return perspective 
we believe many of these transactions employ too much leverage and are priced too low relative to the risks inherent in junior debt instruments 
to address the currently active merger and acquisition market for private companies  our strategy is to focus on buyout and recapitalization transactions where we can manage risk through the structure and terms of our debt and equity investments and where we can potentially realize more attractive total returns from both current interest and fee income and future capital gains 
we are also focusing our debt investing on smaller middle market companies where we can provide both senior and subordinated debt or unitranche debt  where our current yield may be lower than traditional subordinated debt 
we believe that providing both senior and subordinated debt or unitranche debt provides greater protection in the capital structures of our portfolio companies

unitranche debt is a single debt investment that is a blend of senior and subordinated debt 
the yield on a unitranche investment reflects the blended yield of senior and subordinated debt combined 
in january and february  we funded private finance investments totaling million 
we generally fund new investments using cash 
in addition  we may acquire securities in exchange for our common equity 
also  we may acquire new securities through the reinvestment of previously accrued interest and dividends in debt or equity securities  or the current reinvestment of interest and dividend income through the receipt of a debt or equity security payment in kind income 
from time to time we may opt to reinvest accrued interest receivable in a new debt or equity security in lieu of receiving such interest in cash 
the level of investment activity for investments funded and principal repayments for private finance investments can vary substantially from period to period depending on the number and size of investments that we make or that we exit and many other factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment  and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
we believe that merger and acquisition activity in the middle market was strong in and continued into  which has resulted in an increase in private finance investment opportunities  as well as increased repayments 
we currently have an active pipeline of new investments under consideration 
we believe that merger and acquisition activity for middle market companies will continue to be strong into portfolio yield 
the yield on the private finance loans and debt securities was at december   as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the weighted average yield on the private finance loans and debt securities may fluctuate from year to year depending on the yield on new loans and debt securities funded  the yield on loans and debt securities repaid  the amount of loans and debt securities for which interest is not accruing and the amount of lower yielding senior or unitranche debt in the portfolio at the end of the year 
the yield on the private finance portfolio has declined partly due to our strategy to pursue more buyout and recapitalization transactions  which may include investing in senior debt  as well as pursue unitranche investments

hedging activities we have invested in commercial mortgage loans and cmbs and cdo bonds  which were purchased at prices that were based in part on comparable treasury rates 
we have entered into transactions with one or more financial institutions to hedge against movement in treasury rates on certain of the commercial mortgage loans and cmbs and cdo bonds 
these transactions  referred to as short sales  involve receiving the proceeds from the short sales of borrowed treasury securities  with the obligation to replenish the borrowed treasury securities at a later date based on the then current market price  whatever that price may be 
risks in these contracts arise from movements in the value of the borrowed treasury securities due to changes in interest rates and from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
if the value of the borrowed treasury securities increases  we will incur losses on these transactions 
these losses are limited to the increase in value of the borrowed treasury securities  conversely  the value of the hedged commercial real estate assets would likely increase 
if the value of the borrowed treasury securities decreases  we will incur gains on these transactions which are limited to the decline in value of the borrowed treasury securities  conversely  the value of the hedged commercial real estate assets would likely decrease 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty in connection with these transactions 
the total obligations to replenish borrowed treasury securities  including accrued interest payable on the obligations  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the net proceeds related to the sales of the borrowed treasury securities plus or minus the additional cash collateral provided or received under the terms of the transactions were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the hedge at december   related to commercial mortgage loans and the hedge at december   related primarily to cmbs and cdo bonds

portfolio asset quality portfolio by grade 
we employ a grading system for our entire portfolio 
grade is used for those investments from which a capital gain is expected 
grade is used for investments performing in accordance with plan 
grade is used for investments that require closer monitoring  however  no loss of investment return or principal is expected 
grade is used for investments that are in workout and for which some loss of current investment return is expected  but no loss of principal is expected 
grade is used for investments that are in workout and for which some loss of principal is expected 
at december  and  our portfolio was graded as follows portfolio percentage of portfolio percentage of grade at value total portfolio at value total portfolio in millions the value of the cmbs and cdo assets sold on may   was million at december   and this value was included in grade assets 
see commercial real estate finance above 
grade portfolio assets increased from million at december   to billion at december   primarily as a result of the appreciation in value of our investment in advantage sales marketing  inc advantage as well as certain other companies 
advantage had a value of million  including million of unrealized appreciation  at december   as compared to a value of million  including million of unrealized appreciation  at december  see further discussion of the valuation of advantage below

part of the private equity business is working with troubled portfolio companies to improve their businesses and protect our investment 
the number of portfolio companies and related investment amount included in grade and may fluctuate from period to period 
we continue to follow our historical practice of working with such companies in order to recover the maximum amount of our investment 
loans and debt securities on non accrual status 
at december  and  loans and debt securities at value not accruing interest for the total investment portfolio were as follows in millions loans and debt securities in workout status classified as grade or private finance companies more than owned companies less than owned commercial real estate finance loans and debt securities not in workout status private finance companies more than owned companies to owned companies less than owned commercial real estate finance total percentage of total portfolio workout loans and debt securities exclude equity securities that are included in the total grade and assets above 
loans and debt securities over days delinquent 
loans and debt securities greater than days delinquent at value at december  and  were as follows in millions private finance commercial real estate finance cmbs bonds commercial mortgage loans total percentage of total portfolio in general  interest is not accrued on loans and debt securities if we have doubt about interest collection or where the enterprise value of the portfolio company may not support further accrual 
in addition  interest may not accrue on loans to portfolio companies that are more than owned by us depending on such company s capital requirements 
to the extent interest payments are received on a loan that is not accruing interest  we may use such payments to reduce our cost basis in the investment in lieu of recognizing interest income 
our loans and debt securities on non accrual status increased by million during this net increase during the year resulted primarily from the move of two loans to non accrual status totaling million at value at december   offset by a net decrease in the value of loans that were on non accrual status at both december  and as a result of these and other factors  the amount of the private finance portfolio that is greater than days delinquent or on non accrual status may vary from period to period 
loans and debt securities on non accrual status and over days delinquent should not be added together as they are two separate measures of portfolio asset quality 
loans and debt securities that are in both categories ie  on non accrual status and over days delinquent totaled million and million at december  and  respectively

dividend income results from the dividend yield on preferred equity interests  if any  or the declaration of dividends by a portfolio company on preferred or common equity interests

loan prepayment premiums were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
while the scheduled maturities of private finance and commercial real estate loans generally range from five to ten years  it is not unusual for our borrowers to refinance or pay off their debts to us ahead of schedule 
therefore  we generally structure our loans to require a prepayment premium for the first three to five years of the loan 
accordingly  the amount of prepayment premiums will vary depending on the level of repayments and the age of the loans at the time of repayment 
fees and other income primarily include fees related to financial structuring  diligence  transaction services  management and consulting services to portfolio companies  guarantees  and other services

operating expenses include interest  employee  and administrative expenses 
the fluctuations in interest expense during the years ended december    and  were primarily attributable to changes in the level of our borrowings under various notes payable and debentures and our revolving line of credit 
our borrowing activity and weighted average cost of debt  including fees and closing costs  at and for the years ended december    and  were as follows in millions total outstanding debt average outstanding debt weighted average cost the weighted average annual interest cost is computed as the a annual stated interest rate on the debt plus the annual amortization of commitment fees and other facility fees that are recognized into interest expense over the contractual life of the respective borrowings  divided by b debt outstanding on the balance sheet date 
in addition  interest expense includes interest on our obligations to replenish borrowed treasury securities related to our hedging activities of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
employee expenses for the years ended december    and  were as follows in millions salaries and employee benefits individual performance award ipa ipa mark to market expense benefit individual performance bonus ipb transition compensation  net retention award total employee expense number of employees at end of period the change in salaries and employee benefits reflects the effect of wage increases  the change in mix of employees given their area of responsibility and relevant experience level  and the termination of certain employees in our commercial real estate group as discussed below 
salaries and employee benefits expense has generally increased due to changes in the composition of our employee resources and compensation increases 
transition compensation costs were million for the year ended december   including million of costs under retention agreements and million of transition services bonuses awarded to certain employees in the commercial real estate group as a result of the sale of the cmbs and cdo portfolio 
transition compensation costs of million for the year ended december   reflect a reduction for salary reimbursements from cwcapital under the transition services agreement of million

the individual performance award ipa is a long term incentive compensation program for certain officers 
the ipa  which is generally determined annually at the beginning of each year  is deposited into a deferred compensation trust generally in four equal installments  on a quarterly basis  in the form of cash 
the accounts of the trust are consolidated with our accounts 
we are required to mark to market the liability of the trust and this adjustment is recorded to the ipa compensation expense 
because the ipa is deferred compensation  the cost of this award is not a current expense for purposes of computing our taxable income 
the expense is deferred for tax purposes until distributions are made from the trust 
as a result of changes in regulation by the jobs creation act of associated with deferred compensation arrangements  as well as an increase in the competitive market for recruiting talent in the private equity industry  the compensation committee and the board of directors have determined for and that a portion of the ipa should be replaced with an individual performance bonus ipb 
the ipb is distributed in cash to award recipients in equal bi weekly installments beginning in february of each respective year as long as the recipient remains employed by us 
the compensation committee and the board of directors have determined the ipa and the ipb for and they are currently estimated to be approximately million each  however  the compensation committee may adjust the ipa or ipb as needed  or make new awards as new officers are hired 
if a recipient terminates employment during the year  any further cash contribution for the ipa or remaining cash payments under the ipb would be forfeited 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment the statement  which requires companies to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the statement was effective january   and it applies to our stock option plan 
our stock options are typically granted with ratable vesting provisions  and we intend to amortize the compensation cost over the service period 
we will use the modified prospective method upon adoption 
under the modified prospective method  previously awarded but unvested options are accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
 except that amounts must be recognized in the income statement beginning january   instead of simply being disclosed 
awards granted on or after january   will be recognized in the income statement 
upon adoption  we estimate that the stock based compensation expense on a pre tax basis  as measured under the statement  will be approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  for stock based compensation related to options granted prior to january   that has not historically been recorded in our statement of operations 
this does not include any expense related to stock options that will be granted in the future as the fair value of those stock options will be determined at the time of grant

administrative expenses for the years ended december    and  were as follows in millions administrative expenses  excluding investigation related costs investigation related costs total administrative expenses the increase in administrative expenses  excluding investigation related costs  for the year ended december   over the year ended december   was primarily due to increased expenses related to evaluating potential new investments of million  accounting fees of million  recruiting and employee training costs of million  and valuation assistance fees of million  offset by a decrease in expenses related to a decline in portfolio workout expenses of million 
administrative expenses  excluding investigation related costs  were million for the year ended december   a million increase over administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses primarily resulted from a net increase in accounting  consulting  and other fees of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to fees associated with the implementation of the requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of including section and valuation assistance  an increase in deal costs related to evaluating potential new investments of million 
costs related to mezzanine lending are generally paid by the borrower  however  costs related to buyout investments are generally funded by us 
accordingly  if a prospective deal does not close  we incur expenses that are not recoverable  an increase in expenses related to portfolio development and workout activities of million  an increase in rent of million associated with the opening of an office in los angeles  ca and expanding our office space in chicago  il and new york  ny  and an increase in other expenses  including stock record expense  insurance premiums and directors fees of million  and travel expenses of million

realized gains and losses 
net realized gains primarily result from the sale of equity securities associated with certain private finance investments  the sale of cmbs bonds and cdo bonds and preferred shares  and the realization of unamortized discount resulting from the sale and early repayment of private finance loans and commercial mortgage loans  offset by losses on investments

we determine the value of each investment in our portfolio on a quarterly basis  and changes in value result in unrealized appreciation or depreciation being recognized in our statement of operations 
value  as defined in section a of the investment company act of  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii for all other securities and assets  fair value is as determined in good faith by the board of directors 
since there is typically no readily available market value for the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process 
at december   portfolio investments recorded at fair value were approximately of our total assets 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make 
unlike banks  we are not permitted to provide a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  we are required to specifically value each individual investment on a quarterly basis 
we will record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful  or when the enterprise value of the portfolio company does not currently support the cost of our debt or equity investment 
enterprise value means the entire value of the company to a potential buyer  including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time 
we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and or our equity security has appreciated in value 
changes in fair value are recorded in the statement of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
as a business development company  we invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of companies 
the structure of each debt and equity security is specifically negotiated to enable us to protect our investment and maximize our returns 
we include many terms governing interest rate  repayment terms  prepayment penalties  financial covenants  operating covenants  ownership parameters  dilution parameters  liquidation preferences  voting rights  and put or call rights 
our investments may be subject to certain restrictions on resale and generally have no established trading market 
because of the type of investments that we make and the nature of our business  our valuation process requires an analysis of various factors 
our fair value methodology includes the examination of  among other things  the underlying investment performance  financial condition  and market changing events that impact valuation 
valuation methodology private finance 
our process for determining the fair value of a private finance investment begins with determining the enterprise value of the portfolio company 
the fair value of our investment is based on the enterprise value at which the portfolio company could be sold in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the liquidity event whereby we exit a private finance investment is generally the sale  the recapitalization or  in some cases  the initial public offering of the portfolio company 
there is no one methodology to determine enterprise value and  in fact  for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is best expressed as a range of fair values  from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value 
to determine the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze its historical and projected financial results 
we generally require portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly unaudited financial statements  as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year 
typically in the private equity business  companies are bought and sold based on multiples of ebitda  cash flow  net income  revenues or  in limited instances  book value 
the private equity industry uses financial measures such as ebitda or ebitdam earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and  in some instances  management fees in order to assess a portfolio company s financial performance and to value a portfolio company 
ebitda and ebitdam are not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles and such information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  cash flow from operations  or any other measure of performance prescribed by us generally accepted accounting principles 
when using ebitda to determine enterprise value  we may adjust ebitda for non recurring items 
such adjustments are intended to normalize ebitda to reflect the portfolio company s earnings power 
adjustments to ebitda may include compensation to previous owners  acquisition  recapitalization  or restructuring related items or one time non recurring income or expense items 
in determining a multiple to use for valuation purposes  we generally look to private merger and acquisition statistics  discounted public trading multiples or industry practices 
in estimating a reasonable multiple  we consider not only the fact that our portfolio company may be a private company relative to a peer group of public comparables  but we also consider the size and scope of our portfolio company and its specific strengths and weaknesses 
in some cases  the best valuation methodology may be a discounted cash flow analysis based on future projections 
if a portfolio company is distressed  a liquidation analysis may provide the best indication of enterprise value 
if there is adequate enterprise value to support the repayment of our debt  the fair value of our loan or debt security normally corresponds to cost unless the borrower s condition or other factors lead to a determination of fair value at a different amount 
the fair value of equity interests in portfolio companies is determined based on various factors  including the enterprise value remaining for equity holders after the repayment of the portfolio company s debt and other preference capital  and other pertinent factors such as recent offers to purchase a portfolio company  recent transactions involving the purchase or sale of the portfolio company s equity securities  liquidation events  or other events 
the determined equity values are generally discounted when we have a minority position  restrictions on resale  specific concerns about the receptivity of the capital markets to a specific company at a certain time  or other factors 
as a participant in the private equity business  we invest primarily in private middle market companies for which there is generally no publicly available information 
because of the private nature of these businesses  there is a need to maintain the confidentiality of the financial and other information that we have for the private companies in our portfolio 
we believe that maintaining this confidence is important  as disclosure of such information could disadvantage our portfolio companies and could put us at a disadvantage in attracting new investments 
therefore  we do not intend to disclose financial or other information about our portfolio companies  unless required  because we believe doing so may put them at an economic or competitive disadvantage  regardless of our level of ownership or control 
because of the lack of publicly available information about our private portfolio companies  we will continue to work with third party consultants to obtain assistance in determining fair value for a portion of the private finance portfolio each quarter 
we work with these consultants to obtain assistance as additional support in the preparation of our internal valuation analysis for a portion of the portfolio each quarter 
in addition  we may receive third party assessments of a particular private finance portfolio company s value in the ordinary course of business  most often in the context of a prospective sale transaction or in the context of a bankruptcy process 
the valuation analysis prepared by management using these third party valuation resources  when applicable  is submitted to our board of directors for its determination of fair value of the portfolio in good faith 
for the years ended december  and  we received third party valuation assistance from duff phelps  llc duff phelps and houlihan lokey howard and zukin houlihan lokey for our private finance portfolio as follows q q q q q q q q number of private finance portfolio companies reviewed duff phelps houlihan lokey total number of private finance portfolio companies reviewed percentage of private finance portfolio reviewed at value duff phelps houlihan lokey percentage of private finance portfolio reviewed at value during the third quarter of  s p corporate value consulting merged with duff phelps  llc  a financial advisory and investment banking firm 
the merged company operates under the name of duff phelps  llc 
houlihan lokey was initially engaged in the first quarter of duff phelps and houlihan lokey both reviewed advantage sales marketing  inc in q  q and q in addition  duff phelps and houlihan lokey both reviewed one other portfolio company in q professional fees for third party valuation assistance for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
valuation methodology cmbs bonds and cdo and clo bonds and preferred shares income notes cmbs cdo clo assets 
cmbs cdo clo assets are carried at fair value  which is based on a discounted cash flow model that utilizes prepayment and loss assumptions based on historical experience and projected performance  economic factors  the characteristics of the underlying cash flow and comparable yields for similar bonds and preferred shares income notes  when available 
we recognize unrealized appreciation or depreciation on our cmbs cdo clo assets as comparable yields in the market change and or based on changes in estimated cash flows resulting from changes in prepayment or loss assumptions in the underlying collateral pool 
as each bond ages  the expected amount of losses and the expected timing of recognition of such losses in the underlying collateral pool is updated and the revised cash flows are used in determining the fair value of the bonds 
we determine the fair value of our cmbs cdo clo assets on an individual security by security basis 
when we sold a group of these real estate related investments in a pool in one or more transactions  the total value received for that pool was generally different than the sum of the fair values of the individual bonds or preferred shares 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
for the portfolio  net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation for the years ended december    and  consisted of the following in millions net unrealized appreciation or depreciation reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation associated with realized gains reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation associated with realized losses net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation can fluctuate significantly from year to year 
as a result  annual comparisons may not be meaningful 
at december   our two largest investments were in advantage and blx 
the following is a summary of the methodology that we used to determine the fair value of these investments 
advantage sales marketing  inc in march of  a definitive agreement was signed to sell our majority equity interest in advantage that indicated an enterprise value of approximately billion 
see portfolio and investment activity above 
at december   we estimated the enterprise value of advantage to be billion given that the closing of the transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and the sales price is subject to pre and post closing adjustments and certain holdback provisions 
using the enterprise value at december   we determined the value of our investments in advantage to be million  which resulted in unrealized appreciation on our investment of million at december  this is an increase in unrealized appreciation in the fourth quarter of of million and an increase of million for the year ended december  net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included a net increase in unrealized appreciation on our investment in advantage of million for the year ended december  both houlihan lokey and duff phelps assisted us by reviewing our valuation of our investment in advantage at december  duff phelps also assisted us by reviewing our valuation of our investment in advantage at december  business loan express  llc 
to determine the value of our investment in blx at december   we performed four separate valuation analyses to determine a range of values analysis of comparable public company trading multiples  analysis of blx s value assuming an initial public offering  analysis of merger and acquisition transactions for financial services companies  and a discounted dividend analysis 
we received valuation assistance from duff phelps for our investment in blx at december  and with respect to the analysis of comparable public company trading multiples and the analysis of blx s value assuming an initial public offering  we compute a median trailing and forward price earnings multiple to apply to blx s pro forma net income adjusted for certain capital structure changes that we believe would likely occur should the company be sold 
each quarter we evaluate which public commercial finance companies should be included in the comparable group 
the comparable group at december   was made up of cit group  inc  financial federal corporation  gatx corporation  and marlin business services corporation 
the december   comparable group included capitalsource  inc  however  it has been excluded from the december   comparable group as it elected reit status and no longer trades as a commercial finance company 
the remaining comparable group for december   is consistent with the comparable group at december  our investment in blx at december   was valued at million 
this fair value was within the range of values determined by the four valuation analyses 
unrealized appreciation on our investment was million at december  net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation included a net increase in net unrealized appreciation of million for the year ended december   a net decrease in unrealized appreciation of million for the year ended december   and a net increase in unrealized appreciation of million for the year ended december  per share amounts 
all per share amounts included in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section have been computed using the weighted average common shares used to compute diluted earnings per share  which were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
other matters regulated investment company status 
we have elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of as long as we qualify as a regulated investment company  we are not taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains  to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed  or deemed to be distributed  to shareholders on a timely basis 
taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses  and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  as gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized 
in addition  gains realized for financial reporting purposes may differ from gains included in taxable income as a result of our election to recognize gains using installment sale treatment  which results in the deferment of gains for tax purposes until notes received as consideration from the sale of investments are collected in cash 
dividends declared and paid by us in a year generally differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income  the distribution of prior year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current year  or returns of capital 
we are generally required to distribute of our taxable income during the year the income is earned to avoid paying an excise tax 
if this requirement is not met  the internal revenue code imposes a nondeductible excise tax equal to of the amount by which of the current year s taxable income exceeds the distribution for the year 
the taxable income on which an excise tax is paid is generally carried over and distributed to shareholders in the next tax year 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry over taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income  as required 
see financial condition  liquidity and capital resources below 
in order to maintain our status as a regulated investment company  we must  in general  continue to qualify as a business development company  derive at least of our gross income from dividends  interest  gains from the sale of securities and other specified types of income  meet asset diversification requirements as defined in the internal revenue code  and timely distribute to shareholders at least of our annual investment company taxable income as defined in the internal revenue code 
we intend to take all steps necessary to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to qualify for such treatment in future years 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our portfolio has historically generated cash flow from which we pay dividends to shareholders and fund new investment activity 
cash generated from the portfolio includes cash flow from net investment income and net realized gains and principal collections related to investment repayments or sales 
cash flow provided by our operating activities before new investment activity for the years ended december    and  was as follows in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities add portfolio investments funded total cash provided by operating activities before new investments from the cash provided by operating activities before new investments  we make new portfolio investments  fund our operating activities  and pay dividends to shareholders 
we also raise new debt and equity capital from time to time in order to fund our investments and operations 
we invest otherwise uninvested cash in us government or agency issued or guaranteed securities that are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states  or in high quality  short term securities 
we place our cash with financial institutions and  at times  cash held in checking accounts in financial institutions may be in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation insured limit 
dividends to common shareholders for the years ended december    and  were million  million  and million  respectively 
total regular quarterly dividends were   and per common share for the years ended december    and  respectively 
an extra cash dividend of and per common share was declared during and  respectively  and was paid to shareholders on january   and january   respectively 
dividends are generally determined based upon an estimate of annual taxable income  which includes our taxable interest  dividend and fee income  as well as taxable net capital gains 
as discussed above  taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses  and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation  as gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized 
taxable income includes non cash income  such as changes in accrued and reinvested interest and dividends and the amortization of discounts and fees 
cash collections of income resulting from contractual payment in kind interest or the amortization of discounts and fees generally occur upon the repayment of the loans or debt securities that include such items 
non cash taxable income is reduced by non cash expenses  such as realized losses and depreciation and amortization expense 
our board of directors reviews the dividend rate quarterly  and may adjust the quarterly dividend throughout the year 
dividends are declared based upon our estimate of annual taxable income available for distribution to shareholders 
our goal is to declare what we believe to be sustainable increases in our regular quarterly dividends 
to the extent that we earn annual taxable income in excess of dividends paid for the year  we may carry over the excess taxable income into the next year and such excess income will be available for distribution in the next year as permitted under the internal revenue code of excess taxable income carried over and paid out in the next year may be subject to a excise tax 
see other matters regulated investment company status above 
we believe that carrying over excess taxable income into future periods may provide increased visibility with respect to taxable earnings available to pay the regular quarterly dividend 
our estimated annual taxable income for exceeded our dividend distributions to shareholders for from such taxable income  and  therefore  we will carry over excess taxable income  which is currently estimated to be million  for distribution to shareholders in accordingly  for the year ended december   we have accrued an estimated excise tax of million 
however  our taxable income for is an estimate and will not be finally determined until we file our tax return in september  and therefore  the amount of excess taxable income carried over from into may be different than this estimate 
see risk factors under item a and note  dividends and distributions and excise taxes of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item because we are a regulated investment company  we distribute our taxable income and  therefore  from time to time we will raise new debt or equity capital in order to fund our investments and operations 
at december  and  our liquidity portfolio  cash and investments in money market securities  total assets  total debt outstanding  total shareholders equity  debt to equity ratio and asset coverage for senior indebtedness were as follows in millions liquidity portfolio including money market securities  cash and investments in money market securities including money market securities  total assets total debt outstanding total shareholders equity debt to equity ratio asset coverage ratio as a business development company  we are generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of of total assets to total borrowings 
we currently target a debt to equity ratio ranging between to because we believe that it is prudent to operate with a larger equity capital base and less leverage 
during the fourth quarter of  we established a liquidity portfolio that is composed of money market securities and us treasury bills 
the value and yield of the money market securities were million and and were held in money market funds  at december  the value and yield of the treasury bills were million and  respectively  at december  the treasury bills are due in june the liquidity portfolio was established to provide a pool of liquid assets within our balance sheet 
our investment portfolio is primarily composed of private  illiquid assets for which there is no readily available market 
our liquidity was reduced when we sold our portfolio of cmbs assets  particularly bb rated bonds  which were generally more liquid than assets in our private finance portfolio 
given the level of taxable income we are carrying over from for distribution in  we established the liquidity portfolio to ensure that we had ample resources from which to distribute this excess taxable income in we will assess the amount held in and the composition of the liquidity portfolio throughout the year 
we did not sell new equity in a public offering during the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we sold equity of million and million  respectively 
shareholders equity increased by million  million  and million through the exercise of employee options  the collection of notes receivable from the sale of common stock  and the issuance of shares through our dividend reinvestment plan for the years ended december    and  respectively 
on january   we sold million shares of our common stock for proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses 
we primarily used the proceeds from the equity offering to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit and for general corporate purposes 
we employ an asset liability management approach that focuses on matching the estimated maturities of our loan and investment portfolio to the estimated maturities of our borrowings 
we use our revolving line of credit facility as a means to bridge to long term financing in the form of debt or equity capital  which may or may not result in temporary differences in the matching of estimated maturities 
availability on the revolving line of credit  net of amounts committed for standby letters of credit issued under the line of credit facility  was million on december  we evaluate our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis 
generally  we seek to fund our primarily fixed rate investment portfolio with fixed rate debt or equity capital 
to the extent deemed necessary  we may hedge variable and short term interest rate exposure through interest rate swaps or other techniques 
at december  and  we had outstanding debt as follows annual annual facility amount interest facility amount interest amount outstanding cost amount outstanding cost in millions notes payable and debentures unsecured notes payable sba debentures opic loan total notes payable and debentures revolving line of credit total debt the weighted average annual interest cost is computed as the a annual stated interest on the debt plus the annual amortization of commitment fees and other facility fees that are recognized into interest expense over the contractual life of the respective borrowings  divided by b debt outstanding on the balance sheet date 
the annual interest cost reflects the interest rate payable for borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
in addition to the current interest rate payable  there were annual costs of commitment fees and other facility fees of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the annual interest cost for total debt includes the annual cost of commitment fees and other facility fees regardless of the amount outstanding on the facility as of the balance sheet date 
unsecured notes payable 
we have issued unsecured long term notes to institutional investors  primarily insurance companies 
the notes have five or seven year maturities  with maturity dates beginning in and generally have fixed rates of interest 
the notes generally require payment of interest only semi annually  and all principal is due upon maturity 
on october   we issued million of five year and million of seven year unsecured long term notes  primarily to insurance companies 
the five and seven year notes have fixed interest rates of and  respectively  and have substantially the same terms as our existing unsecured long term notes 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the new long term note issuance to repay million of our existing unsecured long term notes that matured on october   and had an annual weighted average interest cost of 
during the second quarter of  we repaid million of the unsecured notes payable 
small business administration debentures 
through our small business investment company subsidiary  we have debentures payable to the small business administration with contractual maturities of ten years 
the notes require payment of interest only semi annually  and all principal is due upon maturity 
during the years ended december  and  we repaid million and million  respectively  of this outstanding debt 
under the small business investment company program  we may borrow up to million from the small business administration 
revolving line of credit 
at december   we had an unsecured revolving line of credit with a committed amount of million 
the revolving line of credit  which closed on september   replaced our previous revolving line of credit and expires on september  the revolving line of credit may be expanded through new or additional commitments up to million at our option 
the revolving line of credit generally bears interest at a rate equal to i libor for the period we select plus or ii the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the bank of america na prime rate 
the revolving line of credit requires the payment of an annual commitment fee equal to of the committed amount 
the revolving line of credit generally requires payments of interest at the end of each libor interest period  but no less frequently than quarterly  on libor based loans and monthly payments of interest on other loans

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of critical accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex  or subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies are those applicable to the valuation of investments and certain revenue recognition matters as discussed below 
valuation of portfolio investments 
as a business development company  we invest in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of companies 
our investments may be subject to certain restrictions on resale and generally have no established trading market 
we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors in accordance with our valuation policy 
we determine fair value to be the amount for which an investment could be exchanged in an orderly disposition over a reasonable period of time between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
our valuation policy considers the fact that no ready market exists for substantially all of the securities in which we invest 
our valuation policy is intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio 
we will record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful  or when the enterprise value of the portfolio company does not currently support the cost of our debt or equity investments 
enterprise value means the entire value of the company to a potential buyer  including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time 
we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and or our equity security has appreciated in value 
the value of investments in publicly traded securities is determined using quoted market prices discounted for restrictions on resale  if any 
loans and debt securities 
for loans and debt securities  fair value generally approximates cost unless the borrower s enterprise value  overall financial condition or other factors lead to a determination of fair value at a different amount 
when we receive nominal cost warrants or free equity securities nominal cost equity  we allocate our cost basis in our investment between debt securities and nominal cost equity at the time of origination 
at that time  the original issue discount basis of the nominal cost equity is recorded by increasing the cost basis in the equity and decreasing the cost basis in the related debt securities 
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
for loans and debt securities with contractual payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we will not accrue payment in kind interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the payment in kind interest is not collectible 
in general  interest is not accrued on loans and debt securities if we have doubt about interest collection or where the enterprise value of the portfolio company may not support further accrual 
loans in workout status that are classified as grade or assets under our internal grading system do not accrue interest 
in addition  interest may not accrue on loans or debt securities to portfolio companies that are more than owned by us depending on such company s capital requirements 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discount are capitalized and then amortized into interest income using the effective interest method 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income and any unamortized original issue discount or market discount is recorded as a realized gain 
prepayment premiums are recorded on loans and debt securities when received 
equity securities 
our equity securities in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value based on the enterprise value of the portfolio company  which is determined using various factors  including cash flow from operations of the portfolio company and other pertinent factors  such as recent offers to purchase a portfolio company  recent transactions involving the purchase or sale of the portfolio company s equity securities  liquidation events  or other events 
the determined equity values are generally discounted to account for restrictions on resale or minority ownership positions 
the value of our equity securities in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based on the closing public market price on the balance sheet date 
securities that carry certain restrictions on sale are typically valued at a discount from the public market value of the security 
dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected and to the extent that we have the option to receive the dividend in cash 
dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private companies or on the ex dividend date for publicly traded companies 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
realized gains or losses are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  and include investments charged off during the year  net of recoveries 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized 
fee income 
fee income includes fees for guarantees and services rendered by us to portfolio companies and other third parties such as diligence  structuring  transaction services  management and consulting services  and other services 
guaranty fees are generally recognized as income over the related period of the guaranty 
diligence  structuring  and transaction services fees are generally recognized as income when services are rendered or when the related transactions are completed 
management  consulting and other services fees are generally recognized as income as the services are rendered 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our business activities contain elements of risk 
we consider the principal types of market risk to be fluctuations in interest rates and treasury rates 
we consider the management of risk essential to conducting our businesses 
accordingly  our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risks  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
in periods of rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net investment income 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
we utilize our revolving line of credit as a means to bridge to long term financing 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with long term fixed rate debt and equity 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
assuming that the balance sheet at december   were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would have affected the net income by less than over a one year horizon 
although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of the assets on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in assets resulting from operations  or net income 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by this estimate 
we have invested in commercial mortgage loans  which were purchased at prices that are based in part on comparable treasury rates 
the fair value of these bonds may change as interest rates change over time 
we have entered into transactions with one or more financial institutions to hedge against movement in treasury rates on certain of the commercial mortgage loans 
these transactions  referred to as short sales  involve receiving the proceeds from the short sales of borrowed treasury securities  with the obligations to replenish the borrowed treasury securities at a later date based on the then current market price  whatever that price may be 
risks in these contracts arise from movements in the value of the borrowed treasury securities due to changes in interest rates and from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
if the value of the borrowed treasury securities increases  we will incur losses on these transactions 
these losses are limited to the increase in value of the borrowed treasury securities  conversely  the value of the hedged commercial real estate assets would likely increase 
if the value of the borrowed treasury securities decreases  we will incur gains on these transactions which are limited to the decline in value of the borrowed treasury securities  conversely  the value of the hedged commercial real estate assets would likely decrease 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty in connection with these transactions 
the total obligations to replenish borrowed treasury securities  including accrued interest payable on the obligations  were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the net proceeds related to the sales of the borrowed treasury securities plus or minus the cash collateral provided or received under the terms of the transactions were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the amount of the hedge will vary from period to period depending upon the amount of commercial real estate assets that we own and have hedged on the balance sheet date 
in addition  we may have risk regarding portfolio valuation
