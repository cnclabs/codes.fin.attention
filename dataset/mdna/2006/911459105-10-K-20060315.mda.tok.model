readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
any such statements speak only as of the date such statements were made  and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make subjective judgments associated with estimates 
these estimates are necessary to comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general banking practices 
these areas include accounting for allowance for loan loss  derivatives and hedging  and income taxes 
the company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by management to absorb probable losses from loans in the portfolio 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers numerous factors  including but not limited to management s estimate of a future economic conditions  b the financial condition and liquidity of certain loan customers  and c collateral values of property securing certain loans 
because these factors and others involve the use of management s estimation and judgment  the allowance for loan losses is inherently subject to adjustment at future dates 
unfavorable changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance  including increased loan delinquencies and subsequent charge offs  or the availability of new information  could require additional provisions  in excess of normal provisions  to the allowance for loan losses in future periods 
both fair value and cash flow hedges require assumptions related to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the derivative and the item being hedged 
these assumptions are documented at inception to demonstrate effective hedging of the designated risk 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect future changes in the fair value  the company may be required to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for that derivative 
this change in accounting treatment could affect current period earnings 

table of contents management s determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income earned by subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management believes that the subsidiaries will be able to generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
as management periodically evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax asset  subjective judgments are made that may impact the resulting provision for income tax 
supplemental compensation benefits agreements the company and the bank have entered into supplemental compensation benefits agreements with the directors and certain executive officers 
the measurement of the liability under the agreements includes estimates involving life expectancy  length of time before retirement and the expected returns on the bank owned life insurance policies used to fund the agreements 
should these estimates prove materially wrong  the cost of the agreements could change accordingly

although all of the purchases under the plan were made in a manner consistent with the plan and the investment elections of the plan participants  the company determined that the purchases of up to  shares of common stock by participants in the plan may not have been properly registered in accordance with the securities act of since participants who purchased such securities may have had a right to require the company to rescind the sale of such common stock  the company offered to rescind the purchase of such stock issued to the plan participants 
the rescission offer expired on march   and no participants elected to accept the rescission offer by the company

table of contents net interest income net interest income interest income less interest expense is an effective measurement of how well management has matched interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and is the bank s principal source of income 
fluctuations in interest rates materially affect net interest income 
the accompanying graph analyzes these changes 
logo logo net interest income increased by million  or  in  compared to an increase of and in and  respectively 
volume  rate and yield changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities contributed to the increase in net interest income 
average interest earning assets increased by million  or  in  while average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or 
volume changes of equal amounts in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities generally increase net interest income because of the spread between the yield on loans and investments and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in  average interest earning assets outgained average interest bearing liabilities by million  and the average increase in interest rates and volume changes increased both interest income and interest expense 
the bank s ability to produce net interest income is measured by a ratio called the interest margin 
the interest margin is net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
the interest margin was in  in  and in interest margins are affected by several factors  one of which is the relationship of rate sensitive earning assets to rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
this factor determines the effect that fluctuating interest rates will have on net interest income 
rate sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are those which can be repriced to current market rates within a relatively short time 
the bank s objective in managing interest rate sensitivity is to achieve reasonable stability in the interest margin throughout interest rate cycles by maintaining the proper balance of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
for further analysis and discussion of interest rate sensitivity  refer to the section entitled liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management below 
another factor that affects the interest margin is the interest rate spread 
the interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
this measurement gives a more accurate representation of the effect market interest rate movements have on interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread was in  in  and in the average amount of the interest bearing liabilities as noted in the table  yields earned on average interest earning assets and rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities  increased in  while the average rate of interest paid increased from in to in average interest earning assets increased in  while the average yield on earning assets increased from in to in 
table of contents the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities also affects the bank s interest margin 
the bank s earning assets are funded by interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing demand deposits  and shareholders equity 
the net return on earning assets funded by non interest bearing demand deposits and shareholders equity exceeds the net return on earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
the bank maintains a relatively consistent percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities

actual loan losses  net of recoveries  are charged directly to the allowance 
the expense recorded each year is a reflection of actual losses experienced during the year and management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance to absorb losses inherent to the portfolio 
charge offs exceeded recoveries by million during the year  and a provision of million was expensed for loan losses in  compared to million in and million in the ratio of the allowance to loans net of unearned income at december  and  was

non interest income the following table presents the major components of non interest income for the years indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars service charges and other fees on deposit accounts credit insurance commissions and fees bank owned life insurance investment security losses gains  net other income total non interest income non interest income consists of revenues generated by a broad range of financial services and activities  including fee based services and commissions earned through insurance sales and trading activities 
in addition  gains and losses from the sale of investment portfolio securities are included in non interest income 

table of contents total non interest income decreased  or in this compares to an increase of in  and an increase of in the decrease can be attributed to a  or  decrease in service and other charges on deposit accounts and a  or  decrease in credit life insurance income 
the decrease in service charge income for is due to a significant reduction in customer overdrafts and accounts with non sufficient funds 
the income generated by overdraft and non sufficient funds charges decreased by  in compared to a decrease of  in the bank s subsidiary  fusb reinsurance  inc  which reinsures or underwrites credit life and credit accident and health insurance policies sold to the bank s consumer loan customers  generated premiums and commissions of  in   in  and  in the premiums and commissions declined due to fewer policies being sold as demand for this product decreased in the company and the bank entered into supplemental compensation benefit agreements with the directors and certain executive officers in the bank purchased bank owned life insurance policies to fund those agreements 
the income recognized on these bank owned policies was  in   in and  in non recurring items of non interest income include securities gains and losses 
investment securities sold had a net loss of  in compared to a  loss in and a  gain in income generated in the area of securities gains and losses is dependent on many factors including investment portfolio strategies  interest rate changes  and the short  intermediate  and long term outlook for the economy 
other income includes fee income generated from other banking services such as letters of credit  atms  debit and credit cards  check cashing and wire transfers 
other income decreased  or  in compared to a increase in and a increase in the bank continues to search for new sources of non interest income 
these sources will come from innovative ways of performing currently provided banking services  as well as providing new services in the future 
non interest expense the following table presents the major components of non interest expense for the years indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars compensation and benefits occupancy furniture and equipment impairment on limited partnerships legal  accounting and other professional fees stationary and supplies telephone communication advertising collection and recovery other total non interest expense efficiency ratio total non interest expense to average assets non interest expense consists primarily of four major categories salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expense  and other expense 
most of the expenses in these categories have increased due to the normal course of doing business  however  a full year of operation of the tuscaloosa office accounted for a substantial portion of the increase over the ratio of non interest expense to average assets remained stable during the period at  and in   and  respectively 

table of contents the efficiency ratio was computed by dividing total non interest expense by net interest income and non interest income 
an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same or greater volume of income while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources 
our efficiency ratio for was  compared to in and during total compensation and benefits increased approximately  or  in this increase is attributable to a combination of normal merit adjustments  incentives  an increase in the costs of the group health care plan  as well as the supplemental compensation benefit plan 
additionally  united security sponsors an employee stock ownership plan with k provisions 
the company made matching contributions totaling   and  in   and  respectively 
the increases in compensation expense of in and in are due in part to the staffing of the new calera and tuscaloosa offices 
at december   the bank had full time equivalent employees compared to in  and in occupancy expense includes rents  depreciation  utilities  maintenance  insurance  taxes  and other expenses associated with maintaining eighteen banking offices and twenty five finance company offices 
on december   the bank owned all of the banking offices  however  the columbiana office which opened in the first quarter of is leased 
all alc offices are leased 
net occupancy expense increased in  in  and in the increase in is due to increases in rent expense and utility expense 
the more significant increase in is due to the full year of operations at the new tuscaloosa office 
furniture and equipment expense decreased in  compared to an increase of in and a decrease of in logo logo the bank invests in limited partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects to receive tax benefits in the form of tax deductions from operating losses and tax credits 
the bank accounts for the investments under the cost method 
the investment balances in these partnerships were million  million  and million at december   and  respectively 
losses amounted to   and  for   and  respectively 
management analyzes these investments annually for potential impairment 
during  legal  accounting and other professional fees decreased  compared to increases of  for and  for the decrease in was due to the unusual increase in that was due to significant expenditures required for compliance with section of the sabanes oxley act 
the opening of the columbiana office in the first quarter of will increase non interest expense  however  the increase is not expected to be greater than any other new office opening 
it is expected that the increase in non interest expense will lead to an increase in non interest income  as well as an increase in net interest income 
financial condition united security s financial condition depends primarily on the quality and nature of the bank s assets  liabilities  and capital structure  the quality of its personnel  and the prevailing market and economic conditions 
the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry  resulting in the need to increase equity capital at rates greater than the applicable inflation rate in order to maintain an appropriate equity to asset ratio 
also  the category of other expenses tends to rise during periods of general inflation 
the bank provided funding to alc  its finance company  of approximately million in alc reported net income of million for the year ended december  this is a slight decline from the million in and an improvement over the million in 
table of contents management believes the most significant factor in producing quality financial results is the bank s ability to react properly and in a timely manner to changes in interest rates 
management  therefore  continues to maintain a more balanced position between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations 
provision for income taxes united security continues to receive income tax benefits from tax exempt interest income on loans  investment securities  and tax credits 
the company s effective tax rate for was and for and management s determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income earned by subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management believes that the subsidiaries may be able to generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
loans and allowance for loan loss logo total loans outstanding increased by million in with million outstanding at year end 
loans represent of the company s earning assets and provide of the company s interest income 
real estate loans make up of total gross loans at year end  down from last year 
these loans consist of construction loans to both businesses and individuals for residential and commercial development  commercial buildings and apartment complexes  with most of this activity being commercial 
real estate loans also consist of other loans secured by real estate  such as one to four family dwellings  including mobile homes  loans on land only  multi family dwellings  non farm  non residential real estate and home equity loans 
while the ratio of real estate loans to total loans has declined slightly from to  real estate loans increased million over that time period 
real estate lending remains a primary focus of the company 
commercial loans totaled million at year end these loans increased million  or  from year end to year end continued growth in our new market areas contributed to this increase 
consumer loans are the second largest group of loans which represents of the total loans outstanding 
they amounted to million at year end  a increase from these loans include loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures  including credit cards and other related credit plans 
of these loans were originated at alc 
consumer loans at alc increased from to  all of which are attributed to normal growth in existing offices 
consumer loans at the bank grew million  or  from year end to the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level  which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  including the nature of the portfolio and changes in its risk profile  credit concentrations  historical trends  and economic conditions 
this evaluation also considers the balance of impaired loans 
losses on individually identified impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at each loan s original effective market interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the impairment is recorded through the provision added to the allowance for loan losses 
one to four family residential mortgages and consumer installment loans are subjected to a collective evaluation for impairment  considering delinquency and repossession statistics  historical loss experience  and other factors 
though management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate  taking into consideration the views of its regulators and the current economic environment  there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient and ultimate losses may vary from their estimates 
however  estimates are reviewed periodically  and as adjustments become necessary they are reported in earnings during periods they become known 
the bank s loan policy requires immediate recognition of a loss if significant doubt exists as to the repayment of the principal balance of a loan 
consumer installment loans at the bank and alc are generally recognized as losses if they become days delinquent 
the only exception to this policy occurs when the underlying value of the collateral or the customer s financial position makes a loss unlikely 

table of contents a credit review of the bank s individual loans is conducted periodically by branch and by loan officer 
a risk rating is assigned to each loan and is reviewed at least annually 
in assigning risk  management takes into consideration the capacity of the borrower to repay  collateral values  current economic conditions and other factors 
loan officers and other personnel handling loan transactions undergo frequent training dedicated to improving the credit quality  as well as the yield of the loan portfolio 
the bank utilizes a written loan policy  which attempts to guide lending personnel in applying consistent underwriting standards 
this policy is intended to aid loan officers and lending personnel in making sound credit decisions and to assure compliance with state and federal regulations 
in order to better manage credit risk  alc carefully oversees its portfolio through formal underwriting standards  monitoring of customer payments and active follow up 
alc assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on an aggregate level based upon recent delinquency status  levels of loans in bankruptcy and on non accrual status  and estimates of inherent loss based on historical charge off trends and economic conditions 
alc continues to concentrate more on loans secured by real estate and places less emphasis on automobile loans 
the following table shows the company s loan distribution as of december      and december  in thousands of dollars commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate installment consumer less unearned interest  commissions  and fees total the amounts of total loans excluding installment loans outstanding at december   which  based on the remaining scheduled repayments of principal  are due in one year or less  more than one year but within five years  and more than five years  are shown in the following table 
maturing within one year after one but within five years after five years total in thousands of dollars commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate mortgage total variable rate loans totaled approximately million and are included in the one year category 
the bank and alc ended the year with an allowance for loan losses of million  an increase of  from december  the ratio of the allowance to loans net of unearned income for alc at december   increased from at december   to  while the ratio at the bank declined from at december   to at year end total loans charged off in totaled million 
recoveries on loans previously charged off totaled  resulting in net charge offs of million 
net charge offs for totaled million 
management charged to operations million in as an addition to the allowance for loan losses 
this compares to million charged to operations for and million for net charge offs of million in consist of million from alc and  from the bank 
net loan charge offs as a percentage of average loans declined from in to in 
table of contents non performing assets the following table presents information on non performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
december  in thousands of dollars non performing assets loans accounted for on a non accrual basis accruing loans past due days or more real estate acquired in settlement of loans total non performing assets as a percent of net loans and other real estate accruing loans past due days or more at december   totaled  these loans are secured  and  taking into consideration the collateral value and the financial strength of the borrowers  management believes there will be no loss in these accounts and allowed the loans to continue accruing 
impaired loans totaled million   and million as of december    and  respectively 
there was approximately  and  in the allowance for loan losses specifically allocated to these impaired loans at december   and million of the impaired loans at december   were made by alc 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans for   and was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
in prior years management disclosed only large non performing loans analyzed on an individual basis as impaired 
in  because of the number of smaller non performing loans at alc  management has decided to disclose all loans on non accrual status as impaired  which resulted in the large increase to impaired loans as of december  non performing assets as a percentage of net loans and other real estate was at december  this increase is due to an increase in loans on non accrual  accruing loans past due days or more  and real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
management believes by close monitoring of these loans and through aggressive collection efforts  non performing assets can be reduced 
management reviews these loans and reports to the board of directors monthly 
loans past due days or more and still accruing are reviewed closely by management and are allowed to continue accruing only when underlying collateral values and management s belief that the financial strength of the borrowers are sufficient to protect the bank from loss 
if at any time management determines there may be a loss of interest or principal  these loans will be changed to non accrual and their asset value downgraded 
the bank discontinues the accrual of interest on a loan when management has reason to believe the financial condition of the borrower has deteriorated so that the collection of interest is in doubt 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed against current income unless the collateral securing the loan is sufficient to cover the accrued interest 
interest received on non accrual loans is generally either applied against the principal or recognized on a cash basis  according to management s judgment as to whether the borrower can ultimately repay the loan 
a loan may be restored to accrual status if the obligation is brought current  performs in accordance with the contract for a reasonable period  and if management determines that the repayment of the total debt is no longer in doubt 

table of contents summarized below is information concerning the income on those loans with deferred interest or principal payments resulting from deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower 
december  in thousands of dollars total loans accounted for on a non accrual basis interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income reported and recorded during the year at december   non accrual loans totaled million  or  of loans  compared to million  or  of loans at december  a large portion of these loans are to customers in bankruptcy at alc 
there was an increase in personal bankruptcies last year  and the increase in non accrual loans is a reflection of this increase 
management monitors these loans and takes the appropriate steps to detect further deterioration or impairment  and the reserve is adjusted as needed 
management believes that at december   it has adequate reserves for these non accrual loans 
allocation of allowance for loan losses the following table shows an allocation of the allowance for loan losses for each of the five years indicated

smaller non accrual and adversely classified loans are assigned a portion of the allowance based on loan grading 
the allowance for large pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans is based on such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  adequacy of the underlying collateral value  loan concentrations  historical charge off trends  and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay 
net charge offs as shown in the summary of loan loss experience table below indicate the trend for the last five years

a substantial portion of these loans are in the company s primary market areas 
in addition  a substantial portion of the other real estate owned is located in those same markets 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of the company s loan portfolio and recovery of the carrying amount of other real estate owned is susceptible to changes in real estate conditions in the company s market areas 
investments in limited partnerships the bank invests in limited partnerships that operate qualified affordable housing projects to receive tax benefits in the form of tax deductions from operating losses and tax credits 
the bank accounts for the investments under the equity method 
the bank s interest in these partnerships was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
decreases to earnings associated with the partnerships carried under the cost method amounted to approximately   and  for   and  respectively 
management analyzes these investments annually for impairment 
the assets and liabilities of these partnerships consist primarily of apartment complexes and related mortgages 
the bank s carrying value approximates its underlying equity in the net assets of the partnerships 
the bank had no remaining cash commitments to these partnerships at december  although these investments are considered non earning assets  they contribute to the bottom line in the form of federal income tax credits 
these credits amounted to approximately  in   in and are estimated to be approximately  for also  operating losses related to these partnerships are available as deductions for taxes on the bank s books 

table of contents investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments investment securities available for sale includes government and agency securities of  mortgage backed securities of million  state  county  and municipal securities of million  and other securities of  the securities portfolio is carried at fair market value  and it decreased million from december   to december  at december   approximately million in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos held by the bank had floating interest rates  which reprice monthly  and million had fixed interest rates 
because of their liquidity  credit quality and yield characteristics  the majority of the purchases of taxable securities have been purchases of agency guaranteed mortgage backed obligations and cmos 
the mortgage backed obligations in which the bank invests represent an undivided interest in a pool of residential mortgages or may be collateralized by a pool of residential mortgages mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities have yield and maturity characteristics corresponding to the underlying mortgages and are subject to principal prepayment  refinancing  or foreclosure of the underlying mortgages 
although maturities of the underlying mortgage loans may range up to years  scheduled principal and normal prepayments substantially shorten the average maturities 
as of december   the investment portfolio had an estimated average maturity of years 
interest rate risk contained in the overall securities portfolio is formally monitored on a monthly basis 
management assesses each month how risk levels in the investment portfolio affect overall company wide interest rate risk 
expected changes in forecasted yield  earnings  and market value of the bond portfolio are generally attributable to fluctuations in interest rates  as well as volatility caused by general uncertainty over the economy  inflation  and future interest rate trends 
mortgage backed securities and cmos present some degree of additional risk in that mortgages collateralizing these securities can be refinanced  thereby affecting the future yield and market value of the portfolio 
logo the composition of the bank s investment portfolio reflects the bank s investment strategy of maximizing portfolio yields commensurate with risk and liquidity considerations 
the primary objectives of the bank s investment strategy are to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity and provide a tool to assist in controlling the bank s interest rate position while at the same time producing adequate levels of interest income 
fair market values of securities can vary significantly as interest rates change 
the gross unrealized gains and losses in the securities portfolio are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity or other funding needs 
there were net unrealized losses  net of taxes  of  in the securities portfolio on december   versus net unrealized gains  net of taxes  of  one year ago

on that date  the bank reassessed and designated derivative instruments used for risk management as fair value hedges  cash flow hedges and derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  as appropriate 
on december   the bank had interest rate derivatives with a notional value of million  made up of million in cash flow hedges and million in fair value hedges 
as allowed by fasb  the cash flow hedge qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of accounting  therefore  fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recorded through other comprehensive income 
two cash flow hedges with a notional amount of million were terminated during the first quarter that resulted in a  gain which is reported in other comprehensive income 
this gain will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to income over the original remaining term of the swaps 
during   was reclassified into income 
two fair value hedges with a notional amount of million were used to convert fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit to floating rate 
the company has historically accounted for these swaps under the abbreviated method of fair value hedge accounting under fasb  known as the short cut method  which assumes that the hedging transactions are effective as long as critical terms do not change 
however  the company recently concluded that the cd swaps did not qualify for the short cut method 
broker placement fees present in the cd swap transactions were determined  in 
table of contents retrospect  to have caused the cd swaps not to have a fair value of zero at inception or the same settlement terms each period which is required under fasb to qualify for an abbreviated method 
hedge accounting under fasb is not allowed retrospectively because the hedge documentation required for the long haul method was not in place at the inception of the hedge 
thus  the fair market value of the interest rate swaps should have been recorded into earnings 
however  recording the fair market value of these interest rate swaps as of december   and  would not have had a material affect on the consolidated financial statements 
the fair market value of these two items was  and  as of december   and  respectively

shareholders equity united security has always placed great emphasis on maintaining its strong capital base 
at december   shareholders equity totaled million  or of total assets  compared to and for year end and  respectively 
this level of equity indicates to united security s shareholders  customers and regulators that united security is financially sound and offers the ability to sustain an appropriate degree of leverage to provide a desirable level of profitability and growth 
over the last three years  shareholders equity grew from million at the beginning of to million at the end of this growth was the result of internally generated retained earnings  with the exception of approximately  from stock options being exercised in shareholders equity also was impacted by the net change in unrealized gain loss on securities available for sale and derivatives  net of tax  which decreased shareholder s equity by   and million in   and  respectively

the united security bancshares  inc non employee directors deferred compensation plan permits non employee directors to invest their directors fees and to receive the adjusted value of the deferred amounts in cash and or shares of united security common stock 
united security initiated a share repurchase program in in which it authorized the company to repurchase up to  shares of common stock as adjusted for the two for one stock split that was effective june   however  no shares were repurchased under the program in   or in january  the board of directors terminated the repurchase program which would have expired on june  and approved a new repurchase program  under which the company is authorized to repurchase up to  shares of common stock before december  united security s capital base remains a source of strength as noted above 
additionally  the internal capital generation rate net income less cash dividends as a percentage of average shareholders equity remains favorable at in  as compared to in and in the dividend paid in increased by million over this increase was due to a increase per share in dividends paid in plus a per share special dividend paid in the first quarter of the increase in dividends paid in resulted in the decline in the internal capital generation rate 
the two for one stock split authorized and implemented in increased common stock to an average of million shares outstanding  however  shareholders equity was not affected by the split 
all shares outstanding and dividend per share numbers recorded in prior years have been adjusted as a result of the stock split 
united security is required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
currently  there are two basic measures of capital adequacy a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
the risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure  and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories  each with a specified risk weighting factor 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
the banking regulatory agencies also have adopted regulations which supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum leverage ratio of of tier capital as defined below to total assets less goodwill the leverage ratio 
depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors  the regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of or higher than the minimum level 
the minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
at least of that capital level must consist of common equity  undivided profits  and non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangibles tier capital 
the remainder tier ii capital may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt  and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier ii capital is total risk based capital 

table of contents the following chart summarizes the applicable regulatory capital requirements 
united security s capital ratios at december   substantially exceeded all regulatory requirements 
risk based capital requirements minimum regulatory requirements united security s ratio at december  total capital to risk adjusted assets tier i capital to risk adjusted assets tier i leverage ratio total capital also has an important effect on the amount of fdic insurance premiums paid 
lower capital ratios can cause the rates paid for fdic insurance to increase 
united security s goal is to maintain the capital necessary to keep fdic insurance rates at a minimum 
logo logo logo united security attempts to balance the return to shareholders through the payment of dividends with the need to maintain strong capital levels for future growth opportunities 
total cash dividends declared were million or per share in  compared to per share in and per share in the special dividend of per share in is reflected in the per share dividend payout 
the total cash dividends represented a payout ratio of in  with a payout ratio of and in and  respectively

ratio analysis the following table presents operating and equity performance ratios for each of the last three years 
year ended december  return on average assets return on average equity cash dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets ratio liquidity and interest rate sensitivity management the primary function of asset and liability management is to assure adequate liquidity and to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet day to day cash flow requirements of the bank s customers  whether they are depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers requiring funds to meet their credit needs 
without proper liquidity management  the bank would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
interest rate risk management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management ensures that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable time frame  thereby minimizing the effect of such interest rate movements on the net interest margin 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily from loan principal payments and maturities and through sales  maturities  and principal payments from the investment portfolio 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold are additional sources of liquidity 
loans maturing or repricing in one year or less amounted to million at december  
table of contents investment securities that are forecast to mature or reprice over the next twelve months total million  or  of the investment portfolio as of december  for comparison  principal payments on investment securities totaled million in although the majority of the securities portfolio has legal final maturities longer than years  the entire portfolio consists of securities that are readily marketable and easily convertible into cash 
as of december   the bond portfolio had an expected average maturity of years  and approximately of the million in bonds were expected to be repaid within years 
however  management does not rely solely upon the investment portfolio to generate cash flows to fund loans  capital expenditures  dividends  debt repayment  and other cash requirements 
instead  these activities are funded by cash flows from operating activities and increases in deposits and short term borrowings 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts 
federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and short term and long term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity 
liquidity management involves the continual monitoring of the sources and uses of funds to maintain an acceptable cash position 
long term liquidity management focuses on considerations related to the total balance sheet structure 
the bank  at december   had long term debt and short term borrowings that  on average  represented of total liabilities and equity  compared to at year end the bank currently has up to million in additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb and million in established federal funds lines 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the portfolio of assets and liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames during which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to changes in interest rates  either at replacement or maturity  during the life of the instruments 
sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volume of assets and the volume of liabilities in the current portfolio that are subject to repricing in future time periods 
these differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps and are usually calculated for segments of time and on a cumulative basis 
measuring interest rate sensitivity gap analysis is a technique used to measure interest rate sensitivity at a particular point in time  an example of which is presented below 
assets and liabilities are placed in gap intervals based on their repricing dates 
assets and liabilities for which no specific repricing dates exist are placed in gap intervals based on management s judgment concerning their most likely repricing behaviors 
interest rate derivatives used in interest rate sensitivity management also are included in the applicable gap intervals 
a net gap for each time period is calculated by subtracting the liabilities repricing in that interval from the assets repricing 
a positive gap more assets repricing than liabilities will benefit net interest income if rates are rising and will detract from net interest income in a falling rate environment 
conversely  a negative gap more liabilities repricing than assets will benefit net interest income in a declining interest rate environment and will detract from net interest income in a rising interest rate environment 
gap analysis is the simplest representation of the bank s interest rate sensitivity 
however  it cannot reveal the impact of factors such as administered rates  pricing strategies on consumer and business deposits  changes in balance sheet mix  or the effect of various options embedded in balance sheet instruments 
the accompanying table shows the bank s interest rate sensitive position at december   as measured by gap analysis 
over the next months approximately million more interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets can be repriced to current market rates at least once 
this analysis indicated that the bank has a negative gap within the next month range

the tables below depict how  as of december   pre tax net interest margins and pre tax net income are forecast to change over time frames of six months  one year  two years  and five years under the four listed interest rate scenarios 
the interest rate scenarios are immediate and parallel shifts in short and long term interest rates average change in net interest margin from level interest rate forecast  basis points  pre tax months year years years cumulative earnings change from level interest rate forecast  dollars  pre tax months year years years 
table of contents assessing long term interest rate risk market value of equity and estimating modified durations for assets and liabilities on a monthly basis  the bank calculates how changes in interest rates would impact the market value of its assets and liabilities  as well as changes in long term profitability 
the process is similar to assessing short term risk but is measured over a five year time period which allows for a more comprehensive assessment of longer term repricing and cash flow imbalances that may not be captured by short term net interest margin simulation 
the results of these calculations are representative of long term interest rate risk  both in terms of changes in the present value of the bank s assets and liabilities  as well as long term changes in core profitability 
as part of the ongoing monitoring of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  the bank enters into various interest rate contracts interest rate protection contracts to help manage the bank s interest sensitivity 
these contracts generally have a fixed notional principal amount and include interest rate swaps where the bank typically receives or pays a fixed rate and a counterparty pays or receives a floating rate based on a specified index  and interest rate caps and floors purchased where the bank receives interest if the specified index falls below the floor rate or rises above the cap rate 
all interest rate swaps represent end user activities and are designed as hedges 
the interest rate risk factor in these contracts is considered in the overall interest management strategy and the company s interest risk management program 
the income or expense associated with interest rate swaps  caps  and floors classified as hedges ultimately are reflected as adjustments to interest income or expense 
changes in the estimated market value of interest rate protection contracts are reflected in either the bank s income statement or balance sheet

as of december   all risk measurements are within policy limitations 
commitments the bank maintains financial instruments with risk exposure not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these financial instruments are executed in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and in connection with its investing and trading activities 
these financial instruments include commitments to make loans  standby letters of credit  and commitments to purchase securities for forward delivery 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to make loans and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank applies the same credit policy in making these commitments that it uses for on balance sheet items 
collateral obtained upon exercise of the commitment is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower and may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  land  and other items 
the bank normally requires collateral for standby letters of credit 
as of december   the bank had outstanding standby letters of credit and commitments to make loans of million and million  respectively 
the bank is prepared to fulfill the above commitments through scheduled maturities of loans and securities along with cash flows from operations  anticipated growth in deposits  and short term borrowings
