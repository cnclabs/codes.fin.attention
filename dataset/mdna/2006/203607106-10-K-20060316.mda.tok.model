lastly  all references to peer banks pertain to a group of bank holding companies nationwide having billion to billion in assets and their associated composite financial results for the nine months ending september  the most recently available disclosure  as provided by the federal reserve board s division of banking supervision and regulation in the bank holding company performance report 
all share and share based amounts reflect the two for one stock split effected as a stock dividend on april  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of community bank system  inc these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward looking statements are set herein under the caption forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies as a result of the complex and dynamic nature of the company s business  management must exercise judgement in selecting and applying the most appropriate accounting policies for its various areas of operations 
the policy decision process not only ensures compliance with the latest generally accepted accounting principles  but also reflects on management s discretion with regard to choosing the most suitable methodology for reporting the company s financial performance 
it is management s opinion that the accounting estimates covering certain aspects of the business have more significance than others due to the relative importance of those areas to overall performance  or the level of subjectivity in the selection process 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the critical accounting estimates include o allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses in the company s loan portfolio 
determination of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective 
it requires significant estimates including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans which is based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
o actuarial assumptions associated with pension  post retirement and other employee benefit plans these assumptions include discount rate  rate of future compensation increases and expected return on plan assets 
specific discussion of the assumptions used by management is discussed in note k on pages through o provision for income taxes the company is subject to examinations from various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions 
management believes that the assumptions and judgements used to record tax related assets or liabilities have been appropriate 
should tax laws change or the taxing authorities determine that management s assumptions were inappropriate  an adjustment may be required which could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
o carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets is based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
a summary of the accounting policies used by management is disclosed in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  starting on page executive summary the company s business philosophy is to operate as a community bank with local decision making  principally in non metropolitan markets  providing a broad array of banking and financial services to retail  commercial  and municipal customers 
the company s core operating objectives are i grow the branch network  primarily through a disciplined acquisition strategy  and certain selective de novo expansions  ii build high quality  profitable loan portfolios using both organic and acquisition strategies  iii increase the non interest income component of total revenues through development of banking related fee income  growth in existing financial services business units  and the acquisition of additional financial services and banking businesses  and iv utilize technology to deliver customer responsive products and services and to reduce operating costs 
significant factors management reviews to evaluate achievement of the company s operating objectives and its operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to net income and earnings per share  return on assets and equity  net interest margins  non interest income  operating expenses  asset quality  loan and deposit growth  capital management  performance of individual banking and financial services business units  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity  enhancements to customer products and services  technology enhancements  market share  peer comparisons  and the performance of acquisition and integration activities 
in  the company reported record earnings as a result of higher non interest income including securities gains  improved asset quality and organic loan and deposit growth offset by higher operating expenses  including special charges  an increased cost of funds  lower investment income and a higher effective tax rate 
capital levels remained strong with both the tier leverage ratio and tangible equity ratio improving from non interest income  including securities gains  increased over as a result of million of gains on the sale of investments  as well as strong growth from banking sources and the company s employee benefits administration and consulting businesses 
operating expense in the fourth quarter of included a one time  million charge related to certain early retirement actions 
asset quality remained strong in  with a reduction in the loan charge off ratios and consistent delinquency and non performing loan ratios versus the company produced loan growth in the consumer mortgage and consumer installment lending portfolios  while outstanding business lending balances declined 
on a geographical basis  the company s new york markets reported strong growth in consumer mortgage and consumer installment loans  with slight declines in business lending 
the pennsylvania markets reported growth in the consumer installment portfolio with declines in the business lending and mortgage portfolios 
total deposits increased over net income and profitability net income for was million  up million or from the prior year 
earnings per share of in were higher than s results 
the growth rate of eps was below that of net income due to higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding driven by the million shares of common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of first heritage in may and the exercise of options under the employee stock plan 
in  the company made significant progress on its objective of shortening the average life of its investment portfolio  generating a per share after tax gain through the sale of securities that had optimized their total return and interest rate sensitivity characteristics 
the results were also impacted by a million  or per share non recurring charge related to the early retirement of certain executives 
earnings in included million of non recurring acquisition related expenses 
in addition to the earnings results presented above in accordance with gaap  the company provides cash earnings per share  which excludes the after tax effect of the amortization of intangible assets and the market value adjustments on net assets acquired in mergers 
management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results 
cash earnings per share for were  up from for the year ended december  net income and earnings per share for were million and  up and  respectively  from results 
the growth rate of eps was below that of net income due to higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding 
the increase in diluted shares was primarily driven by the million and million shares of common stock issued in conjunction with the acquisition of first heritage in may and grange in november  respectively  an increased level of option grants and exercises  and a higher average common share price refer to the earnings per share section of note a on page for information regarding the impact of share price on diluted shares

average loans grew million or  primarily due to strong consumer installment growth as well as the addition of first heritage in may average investments decreased million or in primarily as a result of the sales made throughout the growth in earning assets was funded by million or higher average deposits 
cash flows from the investment sales were used to pay down external borrowings throughout  resulting in million lower average borrowings in as compared to o the loan loss provision of million decreased million  or  from the prior year level 
net charge offs of million decreased by million from  reducing the net charge off ratio net charge offs total average loans to for the year 
asset quality in remained stable and favorable as evidenced by consistent standard metrics such as non performing loans as a percentage of total loans  non performing assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned and delinquent loans days through non accruing as a percentage of total loans 
additional information on trends and policy related to asset quality is provided in the asset quality section on pages through o non interest income for of million increased by million or from s level  the twelfth consecutive year of growth 
banking services were up and accounted for million of the improvement  primarily due to the acquisitions in as well as several revenue enhancement initiatives implemented this year 
financial services revenue was million or higher  mostly as a result of strong growth at the company s benefit plan administration and consulting business 
gains on the sale of investment securities increased million as the company took advantage of market conditions to sell certain securities in order to shorten the average length of the portfolio and maximize their expected total return 
o total operating expenses rose million or in to million 
excluding special charges acquisition expenses in both years  operating expenses rose million or 
a majority of the increase was due to increased personnel expenses associated with the acquisitions in  as well as merit increases and higher costs in employee health and welfare programs 
in addition  higher business development costs associated with a more robust marketing strategy were incurred 
net occupancy expenses also increased because of a larger number of facilities due to acquisitions  current and prior year renovations and maintenance  and slightly higher property tax and utility rates 
operating expenses for include a million non recurring charge related to the early retirement of certain executives 
o the company s combined effective federal and state income tax rate increased percentage points in to  primarily as a result of a higher proportion of income being generated from fully taxable sources loans and investments 
selected profitability and other measures return on average assets  return on average equity  dividend payout and equity to asset ratios for the years indicated are as follows table selected ratios return on average assets return on average equity dividend payout ratio average equity to average assets as displayed in table above  the return on average assets decreased slightly in as compared to  but was above the level 
this was primarily a result of higher expenses due to the special charge taken in the fourth quarter of related to certain early retirements 
reported return on equity in was down slightly from s level 
this was mainly a result of equity capital increasing at a faster pace than net income due to the impact of the first heritage acquisition and the enhancement of the company s capital position through the retention of net profits 
return on equity in was down slightly from s level 
likewise this was mainly a result of the buildup of equity capital from the retention of net profits in as well as the common shares issued in conjunction with the acquisitions of first heritage in may and grange in november the strengthening of the company s equity capital position over the past two years is reflected in the and basis point increases in the average equity to average total assets ratios in and  respectively 
the dividend payout ratio for was above s level based on reported net income mostly due to the and increase in the quarterly dividend in the third quarters of and  respectively 
net interest income net interest income is the amount that interest and fees on earning assets loans and investments exceeds the cost of funds  primarily interest paid to the company s depositors and interest on external borrowings 
net interest margin is the difference between the gross yield on earning assets and the cost of interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
as disclosed in table  net interest income with non taxable income converted to a fully tax equivalent basis totaled million in  down million or from the prior year 
a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities and a basis point decrease in the net interest margin more than offset a million increase in average earning assets 
as reflected in table  the volume changes mentioned above increased net interest income by million  while the lower net interest margin had a million negative impact 
the net interest margin declined basis points from in to in this decline was primarily attributable to the eight rate hikes basis points each by the federal reserve to the overnight federal funds rates since last december having a greater impact on funding costs up basis points than earning asset yields up six basis points 
the rising short term market rates resulted in steady increases to rates throughout the year on interest bearing deposits rates up basis points and total external borrowings up basis points 
conversely  the yield on loans remained relatively stable for the first three quarters of and increased basis points in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 
the yield on investments declined during the year from for to for  as a result of the sale of higher yielding securities 
the net interest margin also declined in each of the quarters of  from for the first quarter to in the fourth quarter 
this trend was mostly attributable to the changes in market interest rates during as well as the federal reserve beginning to raise the overnight federal funds rate in june falling market rates early in the year allowed the company to reduce or hold steady rates on interest bearing deposit accounts in the first three quarters of the fourth quarter of saw interest rates on money market and time deposit accounts rise slightly in response to increasing market rates 
similarly  the yield on loans decreased throughout the first three quarters of the year 
the decline in loan yields had a greater negative impact on the margin in million than the benefit derived from deposit rate reductions million 
yields on investments declined basis points during from to as investment purchases were at generally lower rates 
lastly  the average interest rate paid on borrowings decreased basis points from for to for as shown in table  total interest income increased by million or in table shows that higher average earning assets contributed a positive million variance and higher yields contributed million 
average loans grew a total of million in  the majority as a result of the addition of million of loans through the acquisition of first heritage in may and million from the november acquisition of the dansville branch as well as organic growth in the consumer installment and consumer mortgage portfolios 
interest and fees on loans increased million or 
the increase was attributable to higher average loan balances positive million as well as a basis point increase in loan yields positive million due to the rising rate environment 
average loans grew million in  the majority being the result of the first heritage acquisition as well as the million of loans acquired in the peoples and grange acquisition in late interest and fees on loans increased million or in as compared to the increase was attributable to higher average loan balances positive million  partially offset by a basis point drop in loan yields negative million due to falling capital market rates 
a leveraging strategy was employed beginning in late through mid  which increased average investment balances by million for versus the year earlier period 
in  the company decided to sell certain securities and not fully reinvest cash flows from maturing securities in the current flat yield environment  to take advantage of market conditions to shorten the average life of the portfolio  improve its interest rate sensitivity profile in a rising rate environment  and maximize the expected total return 
as a result  average investments for decreased million and the expected life to maturity of the portfolio was reduced from years at december  to years at december  refer to the investments section of the md a on pages through for further information 
investment interest income in of million was million or lower than the prior year as a result of a smaller portfolio negative million impact as well as a decrease in the average investment yield from to negative million impact 
the decrease in the yield was principally driven by the sale and maturity of higher yielding securities 
the performance of the investment portfolio in remained strong despite the interest rate environment 
the company was able to maintain its yields to a great extent primarily because of two important strategies the addition of a substantial amount of call protected securities in and first half of when rates were higher  and foregoing security purchases in the late to mid period as rates were falling significantly 
the success of these actions was evident in the company s th percentile ranking within its peer group for tax equivalent investment yield for the nine months ended september investment interest income in of million was million or higher than the prior year as a result of a larger portfolio positive million impact  partially offset by a decrease in the average investment yield from to negative million impact 
the decrease in the yield was principally driven by significant declines in market interest rates from early through mid consequently  the company was unable to replace the run off of longer term higher yielding securities with equivalent rate investments 
the company also purchased securities in the relatively low interest rate environment in the second half of and  which resulted in an overall decline in yields  but offered at attractive net spread due to the low cost of the borrowings used to fund the purchase 
the average earning asset yield grew six basis points to in because of the previously mentioned increase in loan yields  partially offset by the declines in the investment yields 
in the yield on the loan portfolio was basis points higher than the yield on investments 
in investment yields were basis points above those produced by loans 
during  changes in market interest rates combined with the strategic investment portfolio actions previously discussed resulted in the yield on the loan portfolio again being higher than the investment portfolio by basis points 
total average funding deposits and borrowings grew by million in deposits increased million  attributable to the acquisitions of first heritage  dansville and organic growth 
average external borrowings declined million in as compared to the prior year as cash flows from the securities sales were used to reduce short term borrowings 
in total average funding increased by million  with million of the increase coming from deposits  mostly attributable to the acquisitions of first heritage  grange and peoples 
external borrowings increased in to fund organic loan growth and investment purchases 
the cost of funding increased throughout reflective of the eight basis point increases to short term rates by the federal reserve since december of interest rates on deposit accounts were raised throughout the year  with increases in almost all product offerings 
the primary drivers of the increase in deposit cost of funds were maturing time deposits rolled over at higher interest rates and customers transferring funds from lower rate interest bearing accounts to a new higher yielding money market product 
this is demonstrated by the percentage of average deposits that were in time deposit accounts and regular savings dropping from and in to and in  while money market deposits increased from in to in the flattening yield curve also resulted in decreasing the interest rate differential between short and long term debt 
total interest expense increased by million to million in as shown in table  higher interest rates on deposits and external borrowings resulted in million of this increase  while the higher deposit and borrowings balances accounted for just million of the increase in interest expense 
interest expense as a percentage of earning assets increased by basis points to 
the rate on interest bearing deposits increased basis points to  due largely to increases in money market and time deposit rates throughout the rate on external borrowings increased basis points to because of the previously mentioned increase in short term market rates 
total interest expense increased by million to million in as compared to a higher level of deposits and borrowings  partially offset by lower interest rates accounted for the increase 
the rate on interest bearing deposits fell basis points to and the rate on external borrowings declined basis points to in the following table sets forth information related to average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and their associated yields and rates for the years ended december   and interest income and yields are on a fully tax equivalent basis using marginal income tax rates of in  in  and in average balances are computed by totaling the daily ending balances in a period and dividing by the number of days in that period

non interest income the company s sources of non interest income are of three primary types general banking services related to loans  deposits and other core customer activities typically provided through the branch network  financial services  comprised of employee benefit plan administration  actuarial and consulting services bpa harbridge  trust services  investment and insurance products community investment services  inc or cisi and asset management elias asset management or eam  and periodic transactions  most often net gains losses from the sale of investments and prepayment of term debt 
table non interest income years ended december  s omitted deposit service charges and fees    benefit plan administration  consulting and actuarial fees    trust  investment and asset management fees    commissions and other    electronic banking    mortgage banking subtotal    gain loss on investment securities debt prepayment   total noninterest income    noninterest income operating income fte as displayed in table  non interest income  excluding security gains  increased by to million  largely as a result of recurring bank fees and growth in benefit plan administration  consulting and actuarial fees 
gain on the sale of investment securities increased million as the company took advantage of market conditions to sell certain securities in order to shorten the average length of the portfolio and maximize their expected total return 
refer to the investments section of the md a on pages through for further information 
total non interest income for increased by over to million  largely as a result of higher bank fees  driven by four bank acquisitions in and  the acquisition of harbridge  growth at bpa and cisi  and the absence of debt repayment charges 
non interest income as a percent of operating income fte basis was in  up percentage points from the prior year  an all time high for the company 
excluding the gain loss on investment securities debt prepayment  non interest income as a percent of operating income fte basis was in  a percentage point increase from for this increase was primarily driven by the aforementioned strong growth in recurring bank fees and benefit plan administration  consulting and actuarial fees and declining net interest income 
this ratio is considered an important measure for determining the progress the company is making on one of its primary long term strategies  expansion of non interest income in order to diversify its revenue sources and reduce reliance on net interest margins that may be strongly impacted by general interest rate and other market conditions 
the largest portion of the company s recurring non interest income is the wide variety of fees earned from general banking services  which reached million in  up from the prior year 
a large portion of the income growth was attributable to overdraft fees  up million over s level  due in large part to the incremental transaction volume generated from the accounts added through the first heritage and dansville acquisitions  as well as several revenue enhancement initiatives implemented this year 
commissions and other increased million  due to higher new york bankers association dividends and transaction fees 
in addition  the increase in electronic banking is directly attributable to a concerted effort to increase the penetration of debit cards as well as the introduction of a business debit card program 
fees from general banking services were million in  up million or from primarily driven by growth in overdraft fees and commissions  a majority derived from the first heritage and grange acquisitions 
as disclosed in table  non interest income from financial services rose million or in to million 
financial services revenue now comprises of total non interest income  excluding net gains losses on the sale of investment securities and retirement of debt 
revenue growth at bpa harbridge up million or was driven by enhanced service offerings to both new and existing clients  a portion of which relates to new actuarial determinations required by certain state and federal healthcare programs 
these two businesses operate collaboratively to offer their clients a full array of employee benefits  recordkeeping and consulting services  on a national basis 
bpa harbridge revenue of million in was million higher than prior year results  driven by seven more months of revenue from harbridge  which was acquired at the end of july  a significant number of new plans under administration and growth in the market value of client assets 
personal trust generated revenue growth of  in  achieved through new client relationships and the investment of additional assets by established clients 
in  cisi and elias were negatively impacted by the challenging retail investment market conditions 
revenues in were down  and  at elias and cisi  respectively as compared to in cisi and personal trust had positive revenue growth of  and   respectively  as improving market conditions positively impacted both businesses 
in addition  in cisi experienced an increased volume of annuity sales in response to higher interest rates and additional client relationships developed in the new markets opened up by the company s acquisitions 
assets under management and administration at the company s financial services businesses rose considerably over the last two years reaching billion at the end of  compared to billion at year end and billion at year end market driven gains in equity based assets were augmented by attraction of new client assets 
bpa in particular was very successful at growing its asset base  as demonstrated by a million or increase in its assets under administration during excluding non recurring retirement charges  the total financial services group contributed million excluding allocation of indirect corporate expense or of the company s pre tax income in  reflecting nearly a operating margin 
in  financial services contribution was million or of total pre tax income  with a margin of 
the higher earnings were the result of new client business at bpa and personal trust 
the increase in percentage contribution was primarily due to growth in the financial services businesses in  combined with the decline in net interest income 
there was a total net gain on security transactions of million in as compared to  in  as the company took advantage of market conditions to sell certain securities in order to shorten the average length of the portfolio and maximize their expected total return 
securities sold included million of us treasury and agency securities  million of aaa rated obligations of state and political subdivisions  and million of investment grade corporate bonds 
the corresponding gains recognized on these sales were million  million and million respectively 
the net gain on security and debt transactions of  in compared to a net loss of million in the loss in was primarily composed of million of charges associated with the early retirement of million of longer term fhlb borrowings that were replaced with lower rate  short term borrowings  which were expected to provide a long term earnings benefit as well as reduce interest rate risk 
the security and debt gains and losses taken over the last three years are illustrative of the company s active management of its investment portfolio and external borrowings to achieve a desirable total return through the combination of net interest income  transaction gains losses and changes in market value across financial market cycles  as well as achieving an appropriate interest rate sensitivity profile in changing rate environments 
operating expenses as shown in table  operating expenses rose million or in to million 
excluding special charges acquisition expenses  operating expenses were up million or in  primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits costs  utility costs and business development expenses 
this year s operating expenses as a percent of average assets were  up from in and in the increase in this ratio for was principally due to the reduction in the size of the investment portfolio  the special charge related to certain early retirement actions as well as more active business development and marketing programs 
the decrease in this ratio for was principally due to an investment leverage strategy executed in the first two quarters of and the acquisitions in late and the first half of grange and first heritage  whereby average assets increased significantly  while operating expenses only increased 
the efficiency ratio  a performance measurement tool widely used by banks  is defined by the company as operating expenses excluding special charges acquisition expenses and intangible amortization divided by operating income fully tax equivalent net interest income plus non interest income  excluding net securities and debt gains and losses 
lower ratios are often correlated to higher efficiency 
in the efficiency ratio increased percentage points to due to higher operating expenses and a decline in net interest income 
the efficiency ratio for was percentage points lower than the ratio for due primarily to increased net investment interest income 
table operating expenses years ended december  s omitted salaries and employee benefits    occupancy and equipment    data processing and communications    amortization of intangible assets    legal and professional fees    office supplies and postage    business development and marketing    foreclosed property  special charges acquisition expenses   other    total operating expenses    operating expenses average assets efficiency ratio higher personnel expenses accounted for of s increase in operating costs  primarily the result of the first heritage and dansville acquisitions in the remainder of the increase in personnel expense reflects higher benefit costs and merit increases 
personnel expenses in were up million from s level mostly due to the four acquisitions made between july and may total full time equivalent staff at the end of was  compared to  at december  and  at then end of medical expenses were up in due to a general rise in the cost of medical care  administration and insurance  as well as a greater number of insured employees 
qualified and non qualified pension expenses increased in principally due to the special charge related to certain early retirement actions and a lower discount rate 
in the qualified and non qualified pension expense decreased slightly due to a change in the company s defined benefit pension plan from a standard annuity paid benefit  to a cash balance design  offset by a reduction of the discount rate applied to future payments from to increases current expenses in present value terms and additional obligations for employees added through acquisition and organic growth 
the three assumptions that have the largest impact on the calculation of annual pension expense are the aforementioned discount rate  the rate applied to future compensation increases and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
see note k to the financial statements for further information concerning the pension plan 
total non personnel expense increased million or in excluding special charges acquisition expense  non personal expenses were up million or from s level 
as displayed in table  this was largely caused by higher occupancy and equipment expense up million  business development and marketing up million  foreclosed property up million and other expenses up million  partially offset by decreases in data processing and communication expense down million and amortization of intangible assets down million 
the increase in occupancy and equipment in was mainly due to incremental costs from recently acquired facilities  expenses arising from renovations and repairs  the effect of higher rates and severe weather on maintenance and utilities expenses  and the general increase in property taxes in many of the locations we do business in 
business development and marketing costs were up due to a more robust marketing strategy in the majority of the increase in other expenses relates to higher overdraft charge offs as a result of higher transaction volume and certain fixed asset write downs 
data processing and communications costs have decreased due to certain contract renegotiations  the assimilation of the acquisitions  and other vendor management programs 
total non personnel expenses increased million or in from excluding acquisition related expenses  non personnel expenses were up million or from s level 
this increase was largely caused by higher occupancy and equipment expense million  legal and professional fees million  data processing and communication expense 
million  amortization of intangible assets million  business development and marketing expense million and other expenses million 
the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses in was mainly due to incremental costs from recently acquired facilities 
the increase in legal and professional fees over the prior year was caused  in most part  by the additional responsibilities associated with complying with new governance and regulatory requirements 
data processing and other expenses were up primarily due to incremental recurring operating expense associated with the five acquisitions completed from july to december intangible amortization in was up versus the prior year due to the amortization of additional core deposit and customer relationship intangibles arising from the and acquisitions 
special charges acquisition expenses totaled million in  up from million in the special charge relates to the early retirement of certain long service executives and includes severance and certain benefit plan enhancements 
acquisition expenses totaled million in  up from  in  comprised of severance and employee benefits of million and legal  consulting and system conversion costs of million 
income taxes the company estimates its tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe the respective tax authorities  plus the impact of deferred tax items 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note i of the consolidated financial statements on page accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
if the final resolution of taxes payable differs from its estimates due to regulatory determination or legislative or judicial actions  adjustments to tax expense may be required 
the effective tax rate for increased by percentage point to 
this increase was primarily due to a larger proportion of income from fully taxable sources versus the prior year period 
the effective tax rate for increased by percentage points over to  for similar reasons 
capital shareholders equity ended at million  down million or from one year earlier 
this decrease reflects treasury share purchases of million  a million decline in the market value adjustment mva  represents the after tax  unrealized change in value of available for sale securities in the company s investment portfolio  and common stock dividends declared of million 
these decreases were partially offset by net income of million and million from the issuance of shares through employee stock plans 
excluding accumulated other comprehensive income in both and  capital rose by million or 
shares outstanding declined by  during the year  comprised of million added through employee stock plans  offset by the purchase of million treasury shares 
the company s ratio of tier capital to assets or tier leverage ratio  the basic measure for which regulators have established a minimum for an institution to be considered well capitalized  increased basis points in to 
this was due to the capital building contribution from retained earnings net income less dividends declared and the decline in average assets  primarily resulting from the sale of certain investments 
the tangible equity tangible assets ratio was at the end of versus one year earlier 
the company manages organic and acquired growth in a manner that enables it to continue to build upon its strong capital base  and maintain the company s ability to take advantage of future strategic growth opportunities 
cash dividends declared on common stock in of million represented an increase of over the prior year 
this growth was mostly a result of dividends per share of for increasing from in due to quarterly dividends per share being raised from to in the third quarter of and from to in the third quarter of the increase in dollar amount of dividends declared was partially offset by a slight decrease in the number of shares outstanding during the year  primarily a result of treasury stock purchases in the dividend payout ratio for this year was compared to in  and in liquidity liquidity risk is measured by the company s ability to raise cash when needed at a reasonable cost and minimize any loss 
the company must be capable of meeting all obligations to its customers at any time and  therefore  the active management of its liquidity position is critical 
given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as the company s desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  the company must have available adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
accordingly  in addition to the liquidity provided by balance sheet cashflows  liquidity must be supplemented with additional sources such as credit lines from correspondent banks  the federal home loan bank  and federal reserve bank 
other funding alternatives may also be appropriate from time to time  including wholesale and retail repurchase agreements  large certificates of deposit  and brokered cd relationships 
the company s primary approach to measuring liquidity is known as the basic surplus deficit model 
it is used to calculate liquidity over two time periods first  the amount of cash that could be made available within days calculated as liquid assets less short term liabilities as a percentage of total assets  and second  a projection of subsequent cash availability over an additional days 
as of december   this ratio was and for the respective time periods  excluding the company s capacity to borrow additional funds from the federal home loan bank and other sources 
there is currently million in additional federal home loan bank borrowing capacity based on the company s year end collateral levels 
additionally  the company has million in unused capacity at the federal reserve bank and million in unused capacity from unsecured lines of credit with other correspondent banks 
in addition to the and day basic surplus deficit model  longer term liquidity over a minimum of five years is measured and a liquidity analysis projecting sources and uses of funds is prepared 
to measure longer term liquidity  a baseline projection of loan and deposit growth for five years is made to reflect how liquidity levels could change over time 
this five year measure reflects ample liquidity for loan growth over the next five years 
though remote  the possibility of a funding crisis exists at all financial institutions and therefore must be planned for 
management has addressed this issue by formulating a liquidity contingency plan  which has been reviewed and approved by both the board of directors and the company s asset liability management committee 
the plan addresses those actions the company would take in response to both a short term and long term funding crisis 
a short term funding crisis would most likely result from a shock to the financial system  either internal or external  which disrupts orderly short term funding operations 
such a crisis should be temporary in nature and would not involve a change in credit ratings 
a long term funding crisis would most likely be the result of drastic credit deterioration at the company 
management believes that both circumstances have been fully addressed through detailed action plans and the establishment of trigger points for monitoring such events 
intangible assets intangible assets at the end of of million decreased million from the prior year end due primarily to million of amortization during the year 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  core deposit value and customer relationships arising from acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill at december  amounted to million  comprised of million related to banking acquisitions and million arising from the acquisition of financial services businesses 
goodwill is subjected to periodic impairment analysis to determine whether the carrying value of the acquired net assets exceeds their fair value  which would necessitate a write down of the goodwill 
the company completed its goodwill impairment analyses during and and no adjustments were necessary 
the impairment analysis was based upon discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
it also requires them to select a discount rate that reflects the current return requirements of the market in relation to present risk free interest rates  required equity market premiums and company specific risk indicators 
management believes that there is a low probability of future impairment with regard to the goodwill associated with whole bank and branch acquisitions 
the performance of elias asset management eam weakened subsequent to its acquisition in as a result of adverse market conditions  however  its performance stabilized in as market conditions improved 
as a result of margin compression and no asset growth  operating revenues continued to decline in certain organizational and structural changes were made late in that will decrease operating expenses going forward 
the company expects these changes will result in improved operating performance for eam in the future 
however  additional declines in eam s operating results may cause impairment to its recorded goodwill of million 
core deposit intangibles represent the premium the company has paid for deposits acquired in excess of the cost that would have been incurred had the funds been purchased in the capital markets 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on either an accelerated or straight line basis over periods ranging from seven to twenty years 
the recognition of a customer relationship intangible arose due to the acquisition of harbridge 
this asset was determined based on a methodology that calculates the present value of the projected future revenue derived from the acquired customer base 
this asset is being amortized over eleven years on an accelerated basis

the loan growth was produced in the consumer mortgage and installment lines of business  with declines experienced in business lending 
loan growth was attributable to the new york market  with the pennsylvania market experiencing a net decline in loans outstanding 
the compounded annual growth rate cagr for the company s total loan portfolio between and was comprised of approximately organic growth  with the remainder coming from whole bank and branch acquisitions 
the greatest overall expansion occurred in the consumer mortgage segment  which grew at a cagr including the impact of acquisitions over that time frame 
the consumer mortgage growth was primarily driven by record mortgage refinancing volumes over the last five years  as well as the acquisition of consumer oriented banks and branches in that time period 
as a consequence  the consumer mortgages segment accounted for of the total loan portfolio at year end versus at the end of indirect consumer installment loans  largely borrowings originated in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships experienced a compounded annual growth rate of over the last years 
business lending grew at a compounded annual growth rate of from to the weighting of retail lending in the company s loan portfolio enables it to be highly diversified 
approximately of loans outstanding at the end of were made to consumers borrowing on an installment and residential mortgage loan basis 
the commercial portfolio is also broadly diversified by industry type as demonstrated by the following distributions at year end real estate development  healthcare  general services  motor vehicle and parts dealers  construction  agriculture  restaurant lodging  retail trade  manufacturing and wholesale trade 
a variety of other industries with less than a share of the total portfolio comprise the remaining 
since may  the mix of loans has become more weighted towards business lending due to the high proportion of commercial loans in first heritage s portfolio 
the consumer mortgage segment of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of fixed and adjustable rate residential lending 
consumer mortgages increased million or in during the last several years  record levels of refinancing activity were driven by mortgage rates that were at or near year lows 
consumer mortgage growth slowed in compared to the past two years  as the pace of refinancing slowed after an extended period of elevated demand in the low rate environment 
the growth was derived principally from activity in the new york markets 
the combined total of general purpose business lending  dealer floor plans  mortgages on commercial property  and farm loans is characterized as the company s business lending activity 
the business lending portfolio decreased million or in the declines were concentrated in the pennsylvania market  while the new york market experienced modest growth 
lending efforts in first liberty s traditional markets continue to be challenged by a modest economic recovery  diminished capital spending levels in the commercial sector  an extremely competitive pricing environment and the company s dedication to maintaining strong credit quality standards 
management has worked aggressively to address the loan generation challenges in pennsylvania by adding enhanced management  lending and credit administration resources  and strong business relationships over the last two years via the acquisition of first heritage in and grange in the enhanced scale and coverage of the pennsylvania business combined with a commitment to business development efforts  positions the company to fully take advantage of growth opportunities in this key market as economic conditions continue to improve and increased capital spending leads to expanded borrowing activity in the commercial sector 
consumer installment loans  both those originated directly such as personal loans and home equity loans and lines of credit  and indirectly originated predominantly in automobile  marine and recreational vehicle dealerships  rose million or from one year ago 
continued moderate interest rates by historical standards  aggressive dealer and manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  and enhanced business development efforts have helped drive strong growth in this segment over the last two years 
consumer installment loans increased in both the new york and pennsylvania markets during the last twelve months

as shown in table above  non performing loans  defined as non accruing loans plus accruing loans days or more past due  ended at million  up approximately million or from one year earlier 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans remained consistent with the prior year at 
the ratio of non performing assets which includes troubled debt restructuring and other real estate  or oreo  in addition to non performing loans to total loans plus oreo decreased to at year end  down three basis points from one year earlier 
the improvement was driven by improvements in the economy  enhanced collection and recovery efforts  and the charge off and disposition of certain problematic loans over the last two years 
had nonaccrual loans for the year ended december  been current in accordance with their original terms  additional interest income of approximately million would have been recorded 
at year end  the company was managing oreo properties with a value of million as compared to oreo properties at a value of million a year earlier

these measures were  and  respectively  as of december  delinquency levels  particularly in the to days category  tend to be somewhat volatile due to their measurement at a point in time  and therefore management believes that it is useful to look at this ratio over a longer period 
the total average quarter end delinquency ratio for was versus in the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the last five years is as follows table allowance for loan loss activity years ended december  s omitted allowance for loan losses at beginning of period      charge offs business lending      consumer mortgage consumer direct and indirect      total charge offs      recoveries business lending consumer mortgage consumer direct and indirect      total recoveries      net charge offs      provision for loan losses      allowance on acquired loans    allowance for loan losses at end of period      amount of loans outstanding at end of period      daily average amount of loans net of unearned discount      net charge offs to average loans outstanding this reserve addition is attributable to loans acquired from first heritage bank in  peoples bankcorp inc and grange national banc corp in and citizens national bank of malone and fleetboston financial corporation in as displayed in table above  total net charge offs in were million  down million from the prior year  principally due to significantly improved results in the business lending portfolio 
net charge offs in were million below s level  and were again impacted by improved results in the business lending portfolio 
a prolonged period of economic weakness from late through early impacted the net charge off levels in both and  with the greatest impact being realized in the business loan segment 
due to the significant increase in average loan balances in and as a result of the factors mentioned above  management believes that net charge offs as a percent of average loans net charge off ratio offers a more meaningful representation of asset quality trends 
the net charge off ratio for was down basis points from last year to 
this year s ratio benefited from improved gross charge off and recovery performance 
gross charge offs as a percentage of average loans dropped five basis points to in enhanced recovery efforts were evidenced by recoveries of million  representing of average gross charge offs for the latest two years  compared to in business loan net charge offs decreased in  totaling million or of average business loans outstanding versus million and in the primary reason for the decreased net charge off ratio for business loans was generally improved economic conditions in the markets served by the company  as well as the charge off of a number of business loans in that had been identified as weak and had been specifically reserved for in previous periods 
consumer installment loan net charge offs increased slightly to million this year from million in  but the net charge off ratio remained consistent at due to larger average balances 
consumer mortgage net charge offs declined million to million 
the net charge off ratio declined one basis point to 
all the primary asset quality metrics deteriorated in and these conditions continued into  in comparison to the period 
this was principally due to the weakened economic conditions in the company s markets  and was manifested most strongly in the business loan portfolio 
based on almost all measurements  the asset quality profile of the company began to improve in in conjunction with gradually improving economic conditions and strengthened credit administration and loan review resources 
significant changes and enhancements were made to lending and credit administration functions in and have continued through these improvements contributed significantly to the positive credit management performance in management continually evaluates the credit quality of the company s loan portfolio and conducts a formal review of the allowance for loan loss adequacy on a quarterly basis 
the two primary components of the loan review process that are used to determine proper allowance levels are specific and general loan loss allocations 
measurement of specific loan loss allocations is typically based on expected future cash flows  collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to pay 
impaired loans greater than million are evaluated for specific loan loss allocations  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
consumer mortgages and consumer direct and indirect loans are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more 
the second component of the allowance establishment process  general loan loss allocations  is composed of two calculations that are computed on the four main loan segments commercial  consumer direct  consumer indirect and residential real estate 
the first calculation determines an allowance level based on the latest three years of historical net charge off data for each loan category commercial loans exclude balances with specific loan loss allocations 
the second calculation is qualitative and takes into consideration five major factors affecting the level of loan loss risk portfolio risk migration patterns internal credit quality trends  the growth of the segments of the loan portfolio  economic and business environment trends in the company s markets includes review of bankruptcy  unemployment  population  consumer spending and regulatory trends  industry  geographical and product concentrations in the portfolio  and the perceived effectiveness of managerial resources and lending practices and policies 
these two allowance calculations are added together to determine the general loan loss allocation 
the allowance levels computed from the specific and general loan loss allocation methods are combined to derive the necessary allowance for loan loss to be reflected on the consolidated statement of condition 
the loan loss provision is calculated by subtracting the previous period allowance for loan loss  net of the interim period net charge offs  from the current required allowance level 
this provision is then recorded as an expense in the income statement for that period 
members of senior management and the loan committee of the board of directors review the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss quarterly 
management is committed to continually improving the credit assessment and risk management capabilities of the company and has dedicated the resources necessary to ensure advancement in this critical area of operations 
the allowance for loan loss was increased to million at year end from million at the end of the million increase was primarily due to million more in loans outstanding  while the company s asset quality profile remained favorable 
the ratio of the allowance for loan loss to total loans was consistent at for year end and management believes the year end allowance for loan losses to be adequate in light of the probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision decreased by million or in as a result of management s assessment of the probable losses in the loan portfolio  and the reduced level of charge offs in  as discussed above 
the loan loss provision as a percentage of average loans decreased from in to this year in most part due to the stable and favorable asset quality trends 
the loan loss provision covered net charge offs by this year versus in  reflective of the reduced level of charge offs this year 
the net charge off ratio in was more consistent with the ratios of the to period 
as previously noted  there was a strong correlation between the increased level of net charge offs in and and the performance of the overall economy 
the company s net charge off ratio was also above basis points during the to period  when the ratio fluctuated between and basis points 
not surprisingly  similar to the period from mid through late  that time frame included a recession and the first stage of an economic recovery 
the net charge off ratio dropped significantly in the years immediately following that period 
in and  the company realized the benefits of one of management s primary goals  which was to steadily bring the net charge off ratio back to a range that was consistent with historical performance 
the following table shows management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type as of december table allowance for loan losses by loan type loan loan loan s omitted allowance mix allowance mix allowance mix consumer mortgage    business lending    consumer direct and indirect    unallocated   total    loan loan s omitted allowance mix allowance mix consumer mortgage business lending   consumer direct and indirect   unallocated total   as demonstrated in table above and discussed previously  the risk inherit in the consumer mortgage portfolio is much lower than that of the other segments of the loan portfolio 
the risk differential is illustrated by the average net charge off ratio of over the last three years for consumer mortgages compared to the average for the rest of the portfolio over the same time frame 
this is manifested in the comparatively small million allowance attributable to consumer mortgages  representing only of the their ending balance versus for the remaining portion of the loan portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses was of the total recorded allowance at december  as compared to at december  funding sources the company utilizes a variety of funding sources to support the earning asset base as well as to achieve targeted growth objectives 
overall funding is comprised of three primary sources that possess a variety of maturity  stability  and price characteristics deposits of individuals  partnerships and corporations ipc deposits  collateralized municipal deposits public funds  and external borrowings 
the average daily amount of deposits and the average rate paid on each of the following deposit categories are summarized below for the years indicated table average deposits average average average average average average s omitted  except rates balance rate paid balance rate paid balance rate paid noninterest bearing demand deposits    interest bearing demand deposits    regular savings deposits    money market deposits    time deposits    total deposits    as displayed in table above  total average deposits for equaled billion  up million or from the prior year 
this increase was principally the result of deposits obtained through the first heritage and dansville acquisitions in the second and fourth quarter of  respectively 
average deposits in were up million or from this increase was principally the result of deposits obtained through the first heritage acquisition in and the grange and peoples acquisitions in late the company s funding composition continues to benefit from a high level of ipc deposits  which reached an all time high in with an average balance of billion  an increase of million or over the comparable period 
this was largely due to the million and million in ipc deposits added in conjunction with the acquisition of first heritage in may and dansville in december  respectively 
ipc deposits are frequently considered to be a bank s most attractive source of funding because they are generally stable  do not need to be collateralized  have a relatively low cost  and provide a strong customer base for which a variety of loan  deposit and other financial service related products can be sold 
full year average deposits of local municipalities rose million or during  with the first heritage and dansville acquisitions accounting for million of the increase 
the company is required to collateralize all local government deposits with marketable securities from its investment portfolio 
because of this stipulation  management considers this source of funding to be similar to external borrowings 
as such  the company generally prices these deposits consistent with alternative external borrowing rates 
the mix of average deposits in changed slightly in comparison to the weightings of noninterest bearing demand deposit and money market balances increased from their levels  while interest checking  savings and time deposit weightings decreased 
this change in deposit mix may have reflected customers expectations for rising rates and consequently their unwillingness to be locked into rates and products for extended periods of time 
new product introductions  proactive marketing and increased yields on money markets accounts throughout the year resulted in the average balance for money market accounts increasing from of the total deposits to of total deposits 
recently  as interest rates have risen  time deposits have attracted more funds 
this shift in mix  combined with increasing interest rates on money market and time deposit accounts increased the cost of interest bearing deposits from in to in the remaining maturities of time deposits in amounts of  or more outstanding as of december are as follows table time deposit  maturities s omitted less than three months   three months to six months   six months to one year   over one year   total   external borrowings are defined as funding sources available on a national market basis  generally requiring some form of collateralization 
borrowing sources for the company include the federal home loan bank of new york and federal reserve bank of new york  as well as access to the repurchase market through established relationships with primary market security dealers 
the company also had approximately million in fixed and floating rate subordinated debt outstanding at the end of that is held by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts 
external borrowings averaged million or of total funding sources for all of as compared to million or of total funding sources for as shown in table below  at year end  million or of external borrowings had remaining terms of one year or less  down considerably from million and at the end of this change in external funding mix is the result of not fully reinvesting the cash flows from the sales and maturities of investments in the current flat yield curve environment  and instead using the funds to pay off short term borrowings 
as displayed in table on page  the overall mix of funding has shifted in the percentage of funding derived from deposits increased to in from in and down from in fhlb borrowings decreased during the year as cash flows from the sale and maturity of investments were used to reduce short term borrowings 
additionally  the company took advantage of the low point in the yield curve in and converted million of fhlb short term borrowings to long term instruments with two or three year convertible features

these financial instruments consist primarily of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to customers  generally having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee 
these commitments consist principally of unused commercial and consumer credit lines 
standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of an underlying contract with a third party 
the credit risks associated with commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are essentially the same as that involved with extending loans to customers and are subject to normal credit policies 
collateral may be obtained based on management s assessment of the customer s creditworthiness 
the fair value of these commitments is immaterial for disclosure in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the contract amount of these off balance sheet financial instruments as of december is as follows table off balance sheet financial instruments s omitted commitments to extend credit   standby letters of credit   total   investments the objective of the company s investment portfolio is to hold low risk  high quality earning assets that provide favorable returns and provide another effective tool to actively manage its asset liability position to maximize future net interest income opportunities 
this must be accomplished within the following constraints a implementing certain interest rate risk management strategies which achieve a relatively stable level of net interest income  b providing both the regulatory and operational liquidity necessary to conduct day to day business activities  c considering investment risk weights as determined by the regulatory risk based capital guidelines  and d generating a favorable return without undue compromise of the other requirements 
the company executed a number of sales strategies during  with a focus on maximizing the total return performance of the portfolio 
during sales of us treasury and agency securities  aaa rated obligations of state and political subdivisions  and investment grade corporate bonds were million  million and million  respectively 
the corresponding pre tax gains on investment securities recognized on these sales were million  million and million  respectively 
all proceeds from these sales were used to repay short term borrowings from the federal home loan bank of new york 
as displayed in table below  the book value of the company s investment portfolio decreased million or during the year to billion 
investment sales and limited new investment opportunities in the current flat yield curve environment were the primary reasons for this decline in balance 
as of december   the expected life to maturity of the portfolio was years versus years as of december  average investment balances book value basis for decreased million or versus the prior year 
investment interest income in was million or lower than the prior year as a result of the lower average balances in the portfolio as well as a basis point decrease in the average investment yield from to 
this decline in the yield was primarily due to the maturity and sales of securities from the portfolio that had been purchased in higher interest rate environments of previous periods 
it is expected that the portfolio yield will continue to decline given the relatively low longer term rates prevalent in the current market 
the investment portfolio has limited credit risk due to the composition continuing to heavily favor us agency debentures  us agency mortgage backed pass throughs  us agency cmos and municipal bonds insured by third parties 
as of year end  these four aaa rated highest possible rating security types accounted for of the portfolio s total book value  excluding federal home loan bank stock and federal reserve bank stock 
these four security types comprised of total investments as of december  eighty nine percent of the investment portfolio was classified as available for sale at year end versus ninety one percent at the end of the net pre tax market value gain over book value for the available for sale portfolio as of december  was million  down million from one year earlier 
this decline reflects the sales and maturities of securities  as well as increasing market interest rates during the intervening period

these yields are an arithmetic computation of accrued income divided by average balance  they may differ from the yield to maturity  which considers the time value of money 
mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are listed based on the contractual maturity 
actual maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without penalties 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements have been prepared in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
notwithstanding this  inflation can directly affect the value of loan collateral  in particular real estate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates  prices or credit risk 
credit risk associated with the company s loan portfolio has been previously discussed in the asset quality section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
although more than a third of the securities portfolio at year end was invested in municipal bonds  management believes that the tax risk of the company s municipal investments associated with potential future changes in statutory  judicial and regulatory actions is minimal 
the company also believes that it has an insignificant amount of credit risk in its investment portfolio because essentially all of the fixed income securities in the portfolio are aaa rated highest possible rating 
the company does not have any material foreign currency exchange rate risk exposure 
therefore  almost all the market risk in the investment portfolio is related to interest rates 
the ongoing monitoring and management of both interest rate risk and liquidity  in the short and long term time horizons is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by limits established in the policies reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the policies to the asset liability committee alco  which meets each month 
the committee is made up of the company s senior management as well as regional and line of business managers who oversee specific earning asset classes and various funding sources 
asset liability management the primary objective of the company s asset liability management process is to maximize earnings and return on capital within acceptable levels of risk 
as the company does not believe it is possible to reliably predict future interest rate movements  it has maintained an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify sources of interest rate risk in varying rate environments 
the primary tools used by the company in managing interest rate risk are the income simulation model and economic value of equity modeling 
interest rate risk interest rate risk irr can result from the timing differences in the maturity repricing of an institution s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  and differences in the behavior of lending and funding rates  sometimes referred to as basis risk  an example of basis risk would occur if floating rate assets and liabilities  with otherwise identical repricing characteristics  were based on market indexes that were imperfectly correlated 
given the potential types and differing related characteristics of irr  it is important that the company maintain an appropriate process and set of measurement tools that enable it to identify and quantify its primary sources of irr 
the company also recognizes that effective management of irr includes an understanding of when potential adverse changes in interest rates will flow through the income statement 
accordingly  the company will manage its position so that it monitors its exposure to net interest income over both a one year planning horizon and a longer term strategic horizon 
it is the company s objective to manage its exposure to interest rate risk  bearing in mind that it will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may net interest margin be reduced 
income simulation income simulation is tested on a wide variety of balance sheet and treasury yield curve scenarios 
the simulation projects changes in net interest income caused by the effect of changes in interest rates 
the model requires management to make assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from management s outlook  as are the assumptions used for new loan yields and deposit rates 
loan prepayment speeds are based on a combination of current industry averages and internal historical prepayments 
balance sheet and yield curve assumptions are analyzed and reviewed by the alco committee regularly 
the following table reflects the company s one year net interest income sensitivity  using december  asset and liability levels as a starting point 
the prime rate and federal funds rates are assumed to move up basis points and down basis points over a month period while the treasury curve shifts to spreads over federal funds that are more consistent with historical norms 
deposit rates are assumed to move in a manner that reflects the historical relationship between deposit rate movement and changes in the federal funds rate  generally reflecting of the movement of the federal funds rate 
cash flows are based on contractual maturity  optionality and amortization schedules along with applicable prepayments derived from internal historical data and external sources 
net interest income sensitivity model calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income at december changes in interest rates basis points   basis points   in the model  the modeled nii in a falling rate environment is less favorable than if rates were to rise due to a faster reaction of assets repricing than liabilities 
the rising rate environment reflects an increase in net interest income nii from a flat rate environment largely due fewer short term capital market borrowings repricing 
over a longer time period the growth in nii improves even more significantly in a rising rate environment as lower yielding earning assets mature and are replaced at higher rates 
the analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and other factors 
while the assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above 
those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and off balance sheet financial instruments 
such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and shifts in the maturity curve of interest rates and provide management with a long term interest rate risk metric
