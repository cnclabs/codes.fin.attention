item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statement this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private litigation reform act of some of the forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  approximately  intends  plans  estimates  projects  strategy  or anticipates  or the negative of those words or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements  including those factors described in risk factors under item a in this form k 
some factors include changes in governmental  legislative and environmental restrictions  catastrophic losses from fires  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  insect infestations or diseases  as well as changes in economic conditions and competition in our domestic and export markets and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contemplated by our projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted results as reflected in forward looking statements relating to our operations and business include  but are not limited to the failure to meet our expectations with respect to our likely future performance  an unanticipated reduction in the demand for timber products and or an unanticipated increase in supply of timber products  an unanticipated reduction in demand for higher and better use timberlands or non strategic timberlands  our failure to make strategic acquisitions or to integrate any such acquisitions effectively or  conversely  our failure to make strategic divestitures  and our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or reit 
it is likely that if one or more of the risks materializes  or if one or more assumptions prove to be incorrect  the current expectations of plum creek and its management will not be realized 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date made  and neither plum creek nor its management undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
overview operating performance operating income decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease was due primarily to lower income from our manufactured products segment 
operating income for our manufactured products segment decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease was due primarily to lower lumber and plywood prices and higher manufacturing costs 
despite record high housing starts in  lumber and plywood prices declined due to increased supply increased production in the united states and higher imports 
manufacturing costs increased due primarily to higher costs for logs and energy 
during  we recorded a million impairment loss related to one of our lumber mills 
operating income in our northern resources segment increased by million to million 
this increase was due primarily to a increase in sawlog prices and a increase in harvest volume  largely offset by higher log haul cost 
operating income in our southern resources segment increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was due primarily to a increase in harvest volume and a increase in sawlog prices  partially offset by higher log haul cost 
operating income from our real estate segment decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was due primarily to fewer acres sold in compared to our operating income was significantly impacted by rising energy costs 
the increase in energy costs has resulted in higher costs associated with logging our timberlands  hauling our logs to customers and running our manufacturing facilities 
the higher energy costs decreased our operating income in our southern resources segment by million  in our northern resources segment by million and in our manufactured products segment by million 
our earnings were also impacted by a million gain on sale of properties  net of tax  primarily related to the sale of our remaining coal reserves see note of the notes to financial statements and a million tax benefit related to the remeasurement of our deferred income tax liability see note of notes to financial statements 
twenty one 
table of contents part ii item during the fourth quarter of  we acquired  acres of timberland in michigan for million 
this acquisition was financed partially by the issuance of million senior notes due as a result of this acquisition and the related financing  we expect operating income in our northern resources segment to increase between million and million and we expect interest expense to increase by million 
key economic factors impacting our business our operating performance is impacted primarily by the supply and demand for logs and wood products in the united states 
the short term supply of logs is impacted primarily by weather and the level of harvesting activities 
the demand for logs in the united states is impacted by housing starts  repair and remodeling activities and the amount of imported lumber  primarily from canada 
housing starts are impacted primarily by interest rates 
mortgage interest rates continued at historically low levels during averaging for the year based on a year fixed rate conventional loan  which contributed to us housing starts of approximately million units during  their highest level in the last years 
however  the number of housing starts is expected to decline during thirty year fixed rate interest rates have generally been increasing in recent months and are expected to reach by the end of additionally  the number of houses and condominiums on the market at december  has increased by over the prior year 
during  the demand for sawlogs remained strong due to increased lumber and plywood production 
additionally during  the demand for wood products remained strong due to the strength in both housing starts and repair and remodel activity 
however  lumber and plywood prices decreased during from their record high prices in as a result of increased supply 
the supply of lumber in the us increased by approximately during due primarily to the construction of new mills and increased imports from canada 
currency exchange rates  tariffs and quotas  availability and cost of transportation  and the relative cost of manufacturing wood products impact imports of lumber and other wood products into the united states 
canadian imports into the us capture a significant share approximately of the us lumber market 
a us industry coalition believes the canadian government  which owns most of the timberlands in canada  provides unfair subsidies by selling timber at below market prices 
prior to  a trade agreement with canada limited imports of lumber into the united states 
since may  the us has imposed duties on canadian imports 
during most of  duties were imposed at approximately 
however  recently the duties have been lowered to approximately  and there is the potential they could be substantially eliminated in the near future 
see us canada softwood lumber agreement under this item 
real estate sales and development properties we estimate that included in our approximately million acres of timberlands are approximately million acres of higher and better use timberlands and about  acres of non strategic timberlands 
the higher and better use timberlands are expected to be sold over the next years for residential  recreational or conservation purposes 
the non strategic timberlands are expected to be sold over the next five years 
included within the million acres of higher and better use timberlands are approximately  acres that will be developed either internally or through joint ventures 
we made significant progress in our land development business during we have identified  acres with an estimated properties  that we expect to develop internally over the next years 
at december   we have ten internal development properties entitled and an additional in the planning process 
revenue from sales of development properties was million during we expect to continue to be in the start up phase of this business during  and as a result  revenue from sales of development properties is expected to range between million and million  plus revenues of approximately million from the sale of one large project 
our real estate development business is conducted through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
additionally  we have identified  acres that we expect to develop through joint ventures 
during  we entered into three joint venture agreements covering approximately  acres 
we are the minority partner in each of these joint ventures  and our involvement is limited to selling and or contributing land and exercising certain approval rights 
we expect to enter into additional joint venture agreements during we do not expect any material revenues from these joint venture agreements during or harvest levels the volume of trees we harvest each year and the percentage of sawlogs and pulpwood included in our annual harvest also impact our operating performance 
during  we harvested a total of million tons compared to twenty two 
table of contents part ii item a total of million tons during we expect to harvest approximately million tons during the increase in the harvest is due to the acquisition of timberlands in michigan 
for the southern resources segment  we expect total tons harvested during to be approximately the same as however  during we substantially completed the conversion of numerous natural stands to plantations in order to improve growth rates 
therefore  we anticipate that the percentage of large diameter sawlogs that we will harvest during compared to will decrease and the percentage of small diameter sawlogs and pulpwood that we will harvest will increase 
see results of operations  compared to  southern resources segment  under this item 
future harvest levels may vary from historic levels to take advantage of favorable prices or due to factors outside of our control  such as weather and fires 
future harvest levels may also be impacted by our sale of timberlands and the extent to which proceeds are reinvested in core timberlands 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition timber sales revenues are recognized when legal ownership and the risk of loss transfer to the purchaser and the quantity sold is determinable 
the company sells timber under delivered log agreements and sales of standing timber or stumpage using pay as cut contracts and lump sum sale agreements 
delivered log sales 
under a delivered log sale agreement  the seller harvests the tree and delivers it to the buyer 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered as risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer 
with delivered log sales  the seller incurs the cost of logging and hauling 
pay as cut contracts 
pay as cut contracts are agreements which the buyer agrees to harvest all of the trees on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each type of tree over the term of the contract usually to months 
in some cases an advance is received in connection with pay as cut contracts  and in other cases the buyer agrees to harvest only certain trees on a tract of land 
under pay as cut contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue is recognized when the trees are harvested  as title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer 
total revenue recognized under a pay as cut contract is a function of the total volume of wood removed multiplied by the agreed upon per unit price for each type of tree on a tract of land 
lump sum sale agreements 
under a lump sum sale agreement  the buyer and seller agree to a lump sum price for all the timber available for harvest on a tract of land 
generally the lump sum price is paid when the contract is signed 
title to the timber and risk of loss transfers to the buyer as the timber is cut 
therefore  revenue is recognized based on the amount of timber actually harvested  compared to total timber available to be harvested on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually to months 
under a lump sum sale  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
lump sum sales are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise  which is an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc total revenue recognized under a lump sum sale contract is the amount of the highest bid  and is not dependent upon the volume or type of trees actually harvested 
since revenue is recognized under a lump sum sale agreement as the trees are cut  an estimate of how much revenue to recognize each month is made based on how much volume has been removed compared to the total volume available for harvest on a tract of land according to the timber cruise 
we generally receive weekly information from the buyer regarding how much volume has been removed 
additionally  we gather information by observing the tract to estimate the percentage of original timber harvested 
in most cases  the total volume harvested from a tract of land is different than the volume estimated in the timber cruise 
if the total volume removed is greater than the cruise estimated volume  we will stop recognizing revenue once the total revenue recognized is equal to total lump sum contract price 
no revenue will be recognized for volumes harvested in excess of the cruise estimated volume 
if the total volume removed is less than the cruise estimated volume  an adjustment will be recorded in the month in which twenty three 
table of contents part ii item we learn of the difference 
the adjustment is an increase in revenue equal to the difference between the total revenue recognized to date and the total lump sum contract price 
finally  for our larger lump sum contracts  which cover multiple tracts  we adjust revenues at the end of each accounting period for any known trends in the tracts that have been completely harvested 
for lump sum contracts completed during the past twelve quarters  our largest quarterly adjustment to record the difference between estimated lump sum revenues and actual revenues has been million 
the following table summarizes amounts recognized under each method from sales to external customers in the company s financial statements for the years ended december in millions revenues from delivered log sales pay as cut sales lump sum sales substantially all of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  a substantial portion of our timber sales consists of either pay as cut contracts or lump sum sales 
under both pay as cut contracts and lump sum sales  the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs 
therefore  operating profit as a percentage of revenue is significantly higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales we estimate that included in the company s approximately million acres of timberlands are about million acres of higher and better use timberlands  which are expected to be sold and or developed over the next years for residential  recreational or conservation purposes 
in addition  the company has approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the next five years 
in the meantime  these timberlands continue to be used productively in our business of growing and selling timber 
the timing of real estate sales  however  is a function of many factors  including the availability of government and not for profit funding  the general state of the economy  the ability to get entitlements  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation and the timing of harvesting activities 
as a result  the timing of our real estate sales may materially impact our reported operating income and net income 
during  the real estate segment reported an operating profit percentage of approximately 
we estimate our real estate segment s annual operating profit percentage could range from to of revenues 
operating profit percentages vary significantly and depend upon the mix of real estate sales 
the operating profit percentage depends on the nature of the interest sold and how much the market value of the property has risen over its book value 
for example  the sale of conservation easements will have an operating profit percentage of close to because no book basis is allocated to this type of revenue 
sales of recently acquired properties will generally have relatively lower operating profit percentages while sales of properties held for a long time will tend to have relatively higher operating profit percentages 
sales of timberlands owned by plum creek prior to the timber company merger  which  for accounting purposes  were deemed acquired as of the merger date  will thus have lower operating profit percentages since these properties were recorded at appraised value as of october in connection with major timberland acquisitions we are generally not able to identify our future real estate sales 
however  while our purchase price allocation and related appraisals reflected greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future for uses which have a higher value than timber production  we are generally not able to identify specific properties 
therefore  in connection with our purchase price allocation for timberland acquisitions  the greater values for real estate are allocated proportionately among all the acres acquired  except when we can specifically identify properties 
in general  however  timberlands are acquired primarily for long term use in our timber operations and specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
we believe that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions  and generally  when we acquire properties  twenty four 
table of contents part ii item we do not have the ability  with any level of precision  to estimate which of the acquired properties will someday sell for more than their underlying timber production value 
impairment of long lived assets in general  the company evaluates its ability to recover its net investment in long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires recognition of an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets used in a business when the carrying value net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets over their expected useful life 
impairment losses are measured by the extent to which the carrying value of a group of assets exceeds the fair value of such assets at a given point in time 
when the fair values of the assets are not available  the company estimates the fair values by using the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the assets 
the cash flows are discounted at the risk free rates of interest 
future cash flow estimates are based on probability weighted projections for a range of possible outcomes 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires recognition of an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of such assets exceeds an amount equal to their fair value less selling costs 
the company has grown substantially through acquisitions in recent years 
a large portion of the carrying value of the company s timber and timberlands  and property  plant and equipment represents amounts of the purchase price of recent acquisitions allocated to those assets 
the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination is highly subjective 
management is required to estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the original allocation  these assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are independent cash flows 
the company tracks cash flows for its million acres of timberlands by grouping them into eight geographic areas in the northern resources segment and nine geographic areas in the southern resources segment 
additionally  the company tracks cash flows for each of its ten manufacturing facilities 
timber and timberlands used in our business 
sfas no 
provides that for assets used in a business  an impairment loss is recorded only when the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable through future operations 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the assets 
the company uses one harvest cycle which ranges between and years for evaluating the recoverability of its timber and timberlands 
as a result of the inherently long life of timber and timberlands  the company does not expect to incur an impairment loss in the future for the timber and timberlands used in its business 
timber and timberlands held for sale 
sfas no 
provides that an impairment loss is recognized for long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of such asset exceeds an amount equal to its fair value less selling costs 
an asset is generally considered to be held for sale when we have committed to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer  and the sale is expected to close within one year 
during  the above criteria were met by a number of our timberland properties  and we recognized impairment losses of million 
similarly  we recognized impairment losses of million in and million during in connection with timberlands held for sale 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
we expect to continue to sell or exchange non strategic timberlands to other forest products companies or non industrial investors  and it is probable that we will recognize  in accordance with sfas no 
 additional impairment losses in the future in connection with sales of non strategic timberlands 
in accordance with sfas no 
 an impairment loss is generally not recorded until management has concluded that it is probable ie  likely that timberlands will be sold within the next months 
for many properties that are currently being actively marketed  it is difficult to conclude whether they will be sold within one year and at what price 
nevertheless  management performs a probability assessment for all properties that are being actively marketed and records an impairment loss to the extent the property s book basis exceeds its estimated fair value net of selling cost in the quarter in which management has concluded it is likely the property will be sold within months based on its best estimate of fair value 
property  plant and equipment 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment represents primarily the net book value of our ten manufacturing facilities 
each manufacturing facility is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through future operations 
the estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful live of a manufacturing facility is highly subjective and is dependent upon estimates for future product pricing  raw material costs  volumes of product sold  twenty five 
table of contents part ii item and residual value of the facility 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment loss of million in connection with one of our lumber mills due to a declining supply of logs 
the availability of logs in close proximity to our mills has been declining and is expected to decline further in the future 
we currently estimate that the carrying value for our other nine manufacturing facilities is recoverable through future operations and that our estimate of future cash flows is reasonable 
however  if wood product prices were to decline and remain weak for an extended period of time  or if log or raw material availability declines more than expected  the company may be required to record an impairment loss for one or more of its manufacturing facilities in a future period 
depletion depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested 
depletion rates for each region are adjusted at least annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south to as long as years in the north 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 
the following table summarizes depletion expense recognized in the company s financial statements  key assumptions and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december dollars in millions  except per ton amounts depletion expense northern resources segment southern resources segment a total depletion expense average depletion rates per ton northern resources segment southern resources segment assumptions used to determine the average depletion rates estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation northern resources segment southern resources segment b estimated future volume in million tons northern resources segment c southern resources segment sensitivity of results to changes in key assumptions increase in depletion expense for a increase in estimated future silviculture costs d northern resources segment southern resources segment decrease in estimated future volume e northern resources segment southern resources segment a depletion expense for includes a million loss  representing the book basis of timber volume destroyed as a result of severe winds from hurricane katrina 
b reflects an increase in our estimates of future costs associated with fertilization treatments due to higher chemical and application costs 
c increase in estimated future volumes is due to the acquisition of timberlands in michigan 
d assumes future timber volumes do not change 
e assumes future silviculture costs do not change 
twenty six 
table of contents part ii item significant estimates and judgments are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in weather patterns  inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers and chemicals  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
the company has invested in technology that enables it to predict its current standing inventory of trees  future growth rates  and the benefits of scientific advancements in connection with seedlings  planting techniques and fertilizer applications 
therefore  while estimates with respect to depletion computations will be revised at least annually  we do not expect the depletion rates will change materially from year to year 
deferred income taxes plum creek has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections of the united states internal revenue code 
a reit is generally not subject to corporate level income tax if it distributes of its taxable income to shareholders and satisfies other organizational and operational requirements as set forth in the internal revenue code 
if a company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
as a consequence of the october  merger with the timber company  which involved merging a taxable entity into a nontaxable entity  plum creek will generally be subject to corporate level tax built in gains tax if the company makes a taxable disposition of certain property acquired in the merger with the timber company within the ten year period following the merger date 
the built in gains tax applies to gains from such asset sales to the extent that the fair value of the property exceeds its tax basis at the merger date 
built in gains tax is generally not payable on dispositions of property to the extent the proceeds from such dispositions are reinvested in qualifying like kind replacement property 
the built in gains tax does not apply to income generated from the harvesting and sale of timber 
in connection with our merger with the timber company  we wrote off all of the timber company s deferred income tax liability related to timber and timberlands except for million 
the million deferred income tax liability relates to the book tax basis difference of timber and timberlands that were expected to be sold  and subject to  the built in gains tax during the ten year period ending october  during the period october  to december   the million deferred income tax liability was reduced by million in connection with sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax 
based on projected timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax for the period december  to october   and our ability to successfully reinvest proceeds in like kind properties  we estimate we need a deferred tax liability of million 
as a result  we reduced the deferred tax liability associated with expected sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax from million to million and correspondingly recorded a deferred tax benefit of million during see note of the notes to financial statements 
it is likely that actual timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax over the ten year period will be greater than  or less than  our current projection 
an adjustment to earnings will be required in the period in which it is determined that timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax will be greater than  or less than  our current projection 
long term incentive plans plum creek has a stockholder approved stock incentive plan that provides for the award of non qualified stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  dividend equivalents and value management awards 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r effective january  see note of the notes to financial statements 
prior to january   the company used the fair value method of accounting for its stock based compensation 
the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  effective january  therefore  the company does not expect the expense for stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units to be materially different under sfas no 
r than the expense it recognized under sfas no 
during  the company recognized in the aggregate stock based compensation expense of million for stock options and restricted stock 
there were no outstanding restricted stock units during twenty seven 
table of contents part ii item in addition to stock options and restricted stock  the company also grants dividend equivalents and value management awards  a portion of which may be payable in the company s stock 
grants of both dividend equivalents and value management awards represent awards that are classified and accounted for as liabilities under sfas no 
r 
as a result  the expense recognized over the performance period for both dividend equivalents and value management awards will equal the fair value of an award as of the last day of the performance period times the number of awards that are earned 
furthermore  sfas no 
r requires the quarterly expense recognized during the performance period to be based on the fair value of dividend equivalents and value management awards as of the end of the most recent quarter 
the company does not expect the total expense recognized over the performance period for dividend equivalents and value management awards computed in accordance with sfas no 
r to be materially different than the total expense currently computed under sfas no 
however  as a result of the requirement under sfas no 
r to base the quarterly expense on the current fair value of dividend equivalent and value management awards  the quarterly and annual expense recognized under sfas no 
r could be materially different than the quarterly and annual expense we recognized under sfas no 
during  the company recognized in the aggregate stock based compensation expense of million for dividend equivalents and value management awards 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company expects to recognize during the first quarter of  a million  net of tax  increase to earnings as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the benefit is based on the difference between the fair values of outstanding dividend equivalent and value management awards as of january   and our accrued liability for dividend equivalent and value management awards at december  after adjusting for the cumulative effect of an accounting change  our accrued stock based compensation liability for dividend equivalent and value management awards is million 
the million accrued liability at january  is based on the current fair value of the outstanding awards times the percentage of months worked during the performance period 
the fair value of the outstanding awards is impacted by our performance compared to several peer groups  the maximum value of an award  and the vested portion of dividend equivalents 
the liability at january  could range between million and million based on the possible fair values of all outstanding awards 
beginning with the first quarter of  any change in our accrual as a result of the change in an award s fair value will be fully reflected in the current quarter s operating income 
pensions plum creek provides pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan and several supplemental non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
participants benefits generally vest after five years of service 
the cash balance benefits for salaried employees is determined based primarily on certain percentages of compensation  age  years of service and interest accrued based on the year treasury bond rate 
furthermore  employees of the company on september   earn benefits based on the greater of the cash balance formula or a monthly pension benefit that is principally based on highest monthly average earnings during any consecutive sixty month out of the last month period and the number of years of service credit 
the benefits of hourly employees are generally based on a fixed amount per year of service 
plum creek s contributions to its qualified pension plan vary from year to year  but the company has made at least the minimum contributions required by law in each year 
furthermore  we intend to fund our qualified pension plan annually such that the fair value of plan assets equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation abo  the approximate actuarially computed current pension obligation if the plan was discontinued 
the company has the same funding policy for the non qualified plans 
however  assets related to the non qualified plans are held in a grantor trust and are subject to the claims of creditors 
twenty eight 
table of contents part ii item the computation of the company s benefit obligation  pension cost and accrued pension liability under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain assumptions involving primarily the following weighted average rates assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at december discount rate a rate of compensation increase c assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected long term return on plan assets b rate of compensation increase c a the december   discount rate was determined by the resulting yield of a hypothetical bond portfolio at december   matched to the expected benefit payments under the plans 
bonds selected for this portfolio had a moody s or standard poor s credit rating of aa or better as of december  b the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the portfolio 
c the assumed rate of increase of future compensation levels represents our long term estimate of such increases on the basis of the composition of plan participants  past results and market expectations 
other key assumptions used in the estimate include primarily those underlying the mortality table  and expected long term rates for inflation  retirement and withdrawals  all of which are based on plan experience and standard actuarial methods but which are nevertheless subject to uncertainty 
it is likely that the actual return on plan assets and the outcome of other uncertain variables will differ from those used in estimating our pension costs and pension obligation reflected in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
furthermore  the company may  from time to time  adjust the asset allocation  which may have an impact on the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the following table summarizes key financial measures and sensitivities to changes in assumption for the years ended december in millions key financial measures pension expense cash pension plan contributions qualified plan cash grantor trust funding supplemental plans unfunded accrued pension cost sensitivity to changes in key assumptions increase in pension expense for every percentage point decrease in long term rate of return on plan assets decrease in weighted average discount rate increase in rate of increase in compensation levels increase in qualified pension funding for every percentage point decrease in weighted average discount rate assuming an average long term rate of return on plan assets of  a weighted average discount rate of for and for and beyond  and a rate of increase in compensation levels  we project that our annual pension expense for through will be comparable to the million annual pension expense in over the same time period  the annual cash funding required under our present funding policy and current funding rules for the qualified pension plan is expected to be approximately million during increasing to approximately million by twenty nine 
table of contents part ii item off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments the consolidated financial statements of the company reflect all of the operations and assets and liabilities of the company 
during  the company entered into three joint venture agreements with land developers covering approximately  acres 
we are the minority partner in each of these joint ventures  and our involvement is limited to selling and or contributing land and exercising certain approval rights 
the company has no other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnership  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
consequently  the company has no off balance sheet debt 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into two treasury lock arrangements to secure current long term interest rates in connection with our issuance of million of senior notes due see note of the notes to financial statements 
these hedging transactions were settled for a net amount of less than million 
the company is not a party to any other derivative transactions 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  in millions payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt a operating lease obligations timber obligations long term incentive plans purchase obligations b other long term liabilities c total contractual obligations a in addition to principal  long term debt includes related interest obligations based on the coupon or stated interest rate for our fixed rate debt of million less than one year  million years  million years  and million more than years 
also  short term variable rate debt interest of million is included in and is based on the actual interest rate as of december  as we expect borrowings outstanding under our line of credit to vary  only repayment of principal is included 
interest expense related to our line of credit was million in b purchase obligations are comprised primarily of million for raw materials for our mdf facilities  million for third party logs for our plywood and sawmill facilities  million for real estate development  and million for reforestation and silviculture 
c we have not included any amounts for our other long term liabilities  as we cannot estimate when we will be obligated to satisfy these liabilities 
at december   other long term liabilities include workers compensation of million  deferred compensation obligations of million and non qualified pension obligations of million 
we expect to fund approximately million for workers compensation payments in we have made contributions to our qualified pension plan such that the fair value of the pension plan assets at december   exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation 
as a result of this funding level  there are no qualified pension funding obligations at december  we have two grantor trusts  which hold assets associated with our deferred compensation obligations and non qualified pension obligations 
at december   the fair value of assets in one of our grantor trusts is approximately equal to our deferred compensation obligation of million 
additionally  at december   the fair value of assets in the other grantor trust of million exceeded the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation for our non qualified pension plans of million 
assets in our grantor trusts have been reserved for the above obligations

events and trends affecting operating results harvest plans we determine our annual roundwood sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a contiguous block of trees of a similar age  species mix and silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to  acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  certain external conditions such as supply agreements  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
harvest scheduling is the technical approach using computer modeling that considers all thirty 
table of contents part ii item of the above factors along with forest growth rates and financial assumptions to project future harvest plans for a number of years forward 
actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of timberland sales and acquisitions  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors that may be outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs 
furthermore  future harvest levels may be impacted by both our planned sales of non strategic and higher and better use timberlands 
the impact will depend on the level and extent we are able to reinvest proceeds in productive timberlands and the stocking levels and age class distribution of any newly acquired timberlands 
harvest levels in the northern resources segment were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during harvest levels in the northern resources segment in are expected to increase by approximately over and are expected to be sawlogs and pulpwood 
the primarily reason for this increase and change in mix is due to our acquisition of  acres of timberlands in michigan during the fourth quarter of harvest levels in the southern resources segment were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during harvest levels in the southern resources segment in are expected to increase by approximately over and are expected to be sawlogs and pulpwood 
us canada softwood lumber agreement historically  canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market  particularly in the new home construction market 
this source of lumber was constrained in april when a five year lumber trade agreement between the us and canada went into effect 
the trade agreement was intended to limit the volume of canadian lumber exported into the us through the assessment of an export tariff on annual lumber exports to the us in excess of certain levels from the four major producing canadian provinces 
the trade agreement expired in march  and soon thereafter a us industry coalition  of which plum creek is a member  submitted anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions to the international trade commission and the us department of commerce 
in march  the department of commerce rendered a final determination in favor of the us industry coalition and set a countervailing duty on canadian lumber imports and an anti dumping duty on all non investigated canadian exporters averaging representing the weighted average of the anti dumping rates imposed on the investigated canadian exporters 
the department of commerce decreased these duties in april to and  respectively  and in december  it decreased them again to and  respectively 
in december  the countervailing duty rate was reduced to and the anti dumping duty was reduced to  for a combined duty of 
due to strong demand for lumber in the us and favorable lumber prices  the duties have not thus far had the effect of decreasing canadian lumber imports share of the us market 
it is uncertain whether canada s share of the us market would be adversely affected by import duties in times of weaker domestic demand for lumber 
the future of the us imposed import duties on canadian lumber remains uncertain 
while the wto and nafta appeal boards have issued rulings on canadian challenges to the duties that affirmed the us position regarding a canadian subsidy on stumpage  the rulings also included provisions for re examining the calculation and level of the duties 
in september  the nafta panel remanded to the department of commerce its subsidy calculation upon which duties are based with instructions to make a de minimus calculation 
in response  the department of commerce issued a subsidy calculation of in november  which could result in the elimination of countervailing duty by as early as september the us industry coalition has challenged the department of commerce subsidy calculation to a nafta panel 
if the calculation is ultimately upheld  it is possible that the countervailing duty could be eliminated entirely 
in addition  the nafta panel has ruled that the international trade commission s determination of injury to us industry from canadian lumber imports  which is the basis for imposing the duties  was not supported with substantial evidence 
the commission unsuccessfully appealed this decision  and as a result was directed to issue a no injury opinion 
the nafta decision was then unsuccessfully appealed to an extraordinary challenge committee under the nafta dispute resolution process 
presently  the us industry coalition has initiated a constitutional challenge to a portion of the nafta dispute resolution process 
the ruling on this challenge could have a material impact on the outcome of this dispute 
thirty one 
table of contents part ii item the us and representatives of the canadian government continue  from time to time  to pursue a settlement agreement 
however  there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached  or that the terms of any such final agreement would be favorable to the us lumber industry s interests 
likewise  there can be no assurance that the ultimate legal resolution of this dispute will be on terms favorable to the us industry s interest 
therefore  other factors remaining unchanged  any downward pressure on domestic lumber and log prices caused by canadian imports could continue or increase  particularly during periods of weak lumber demand 
comparability of financial statement periods acquisitions and divestitures 
we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue both the acquisition and divestiture of timberlands to increase the value of our assets 
during  we acquired  acres of timberlands  located in northern michigan  arkansas and florida 
during  we acquired  acres of timberlands located in arkansas and maine 
during  we acquired  acres of timberlands located primarily in south carolina  arkansas and new hampshire 
we sold approximately  acres of timberlands in   acres in  and  acres in as a result of these timberland acquisitions and dispositions  our ownership was million acres at december   million acres at december   and million acres at december  accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the company s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of timberland acquisitions and divestitures

revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to higher harvest volume million and higher product prices million 
the increase in volume is due primarily to harvesting on timberlands acquired during the past several years  stronger log demand due to new mills  and an increase of harvest levels in certain markets to take advantage of favorable log prices 
revenues in included million from the harvesting of  tons associated with our acquisition of  acres of timberlands in michigan during november of sawlog prices increased by million due primarily to higher demand for logs as a result of increased lumber production and a limited supply of logs 
pulpwood prices increased by million due primarily to low log inventories 
northern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in this increase was primarily due to higher per ton log and haul rates million and higher harvest volume 
log and haul cost on a per ton basis increased by due primarily to higher fuel costs 
segment expenses in included million as a result of our harvesting on recently acquired timberlands in michigan 
for  we expect harvest volumes to increase approximately to million tons 
this increase is due primarily to the approximately  tons we expect to harvest from our recently acquired timberlands in michigan 
thirty two 
table of contents part ii item southern resources segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to a higher percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber million  higher harvest volume million and higher softwood sawlog prices million 
revenues increased million due to the company s increased percentage of delivered log sales 
a portion of the increase in delivered log sales is by way of decreasing the percentage of standing timber sales 
under its delivered log sale agreements  the company is responsible for log and haul costs 
when standing timber is sold  the buyer incurs the log and haul costs 
the company sells logs on a delivered basis when  in management s judgment  log merchandising efforts will yield a premium over selling stumpage 
while revenues are higher when the company is responsible for the logging and hauling of timber  a large portion of that increase in revenue is to cover the related increase in cost of sales 
as a result  on delivered log sales the company realizes lower operating income as a percentage of revenue  even though operating income is generally improved 
harvest volume increased due to favorable harvesting conditions during most of and a planned increase in harvest levels 
the planned increase in harvest levels is the result of an increased percentage of maturing timber on our southern timberlands 
softwood sawlog prices increased temporarily during the first half of due primarily to a weather related shortage of logs 
several of our customers had low log inventories at the end of due to wet weather during the second half of  and as a result  offered higher prices in order to rebuild log decks 
southern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for southern resources segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in log and haul costs as a result of a higher percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber  increased harvesting volume  and higher fuel costs 
the per ton rate increase for log and haul costs  which increased costs and expenses by million  was due primarily to higher fuel costs 
in  approximately  acres of our timberlands in mississippi were impacted by severe winds from hurricane katrina 
as a result  we recorded a million loss in  which represents the book basis for approximately  tons of timber that was destroyed 
following hurricane katrina  we began salvaging timber that was blown down but not destroyed 
for  operating income was reduced by million due to higher logging costs from our salvage operations 
we expect to complete salvage operations during the first quarter of and estimate additional logging costs associated with our salvage operations to be approximately million 
during  we harvested approximately million tons of timber 
we expect total tons harvested during to be approximately the same 
however  during we substantially completed the conversion of numerous natural stands to plantations in order to improve growth rates 
therefore  we anticipate that the percentage of large diameter sawlogs that we will harvest during compared to will decrease and the percentage of small diameter sawlogs and pulpwood that we will harvest will increase 
as a result of this change in log mix  we expect revenues and operating income to decrease between million and million 
real estate segment acres revenues revenue acres revenue revenue property sold millions per acre sold millions per acre small non strategic large non strategic conservation higher and better use recreational development properties conservation easements n a n a total revenues decreased by million to million in excluding revenues from the large  non strategic timberland sales  revenues increased million to million for  compared to million for this increase is due primarily to an increase in land sales activity as the company executes its strategy of selling non strategic timberlands 
large  non strategic timberland sales excluded  the sales of our conservation and small non thirty three 
table of contents part ii item strategic timberlands accounted for approximately of the acres sold during compared to of the acres sold during higher and better use timberland sales represented approximately of the acres sold during compared to of the acres sold during our land portfolio includes million acres of core timberlands   acres of timberland considered to be non strategic  and million acres of timberlands with higher value for uses other than growing timber 
these million acres with higher values are further segmented into three categories conservation  acres  recreation and higher and better use properties  acres  and those properties to be developed  acres 
the non strategic timberlands are expected to be sold as small tracts over the next five years 
the higher value properties  located throughout our ownership  appeal to a variety of buyers and are expected to be sold over the next years 
until these properties are sold  they will continue to be used productively in our business of growing and selling timber 
the timing of real estate sales  however  is a function of many factors  including the availability of government and not for profit funding  the general state of the economy  the ability to get entitlements  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation and the timing of harvesting activities 
we expect revenues from real estate sales during to range between and million from the sale of  to  acres 
we estimate these sales will consist of  to  non strategic acres  up to  development acres and the remainder from the sales of higher and better use and conservation acres 
real estate segment operating income was of its revenues for  compared to for real estate segment costs and expenses increased by million to million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in land sales activity associated with small parcels of non strategic timberlands million  primarily land basis and an increase in costs associated with development activities million  offset in part by a decrease in large  non strategic timberland sales million  primarily land basis 
costs associated with our real estate development activities increased to million in compared to million in due primarily to new costs eg investigatory  appraisals  feasibility studies  environmental and engineering studies  market analysis associated with our expanding real estate development business 
manufactured products segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease was due primarily to lower lumber prices million  lower plywood prices million  offset in part by higher mdf prices million 
despite the highest level of us housing starts since us housing starts during were higher than housing starts during  lumber prices decreased by due primarily to increased lumber production and imports 
us lumber production during the first eleven months of was higher than the same period in due to start up of new mills and capacity expansions at existing mills 
furthermore  lumber imports from canada during the first eleven months of increased by over the same period in  and offshore imports europe and latin america increased by  due primarily to the strength of the us economy and weak foreign markets 
plywood prices decreased by due primarily to the increase in north america structural panels plywood and oriented strand board production capacity and offshore imports 
during  north america structural panel production capacity has increased by approximately one billion square feet  or approximately of the annual us structural panel consumption 
during  offshore imports primarily latin america increased over amounts 
mdf prices increased due primarily to improved demand and a richer production mix 
mdf demand has increased due to strong housing starts and improved repair and remodeling markets 
during the first half of  we resolved all of our start up issues associated with our new mdf thin board line and  as a result  have increased the percentage of higher margin products we produce 
manufactured products segment operating income was of its revenues for and for this decrease was due primarily to lower lumber and plywood prices and higher energy and raw material costs 
manufactured products segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to higher log costs and higher energy prices 
log costs have increased due primarily to a declining supply of logs in montana and favorable lumber and plywood prices 
energy costs  including the impact on resin prices  have increased by million over the prior year 
other costs and eliminations gain on sale of other assets 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead and intercompany profit elimination decreased operating income by million in  compared to a decrease of million in this increase of million was due primarily to higher corporate overhead associated with accounting and timber and timberland systems  and corporate compliance 
corporate thirty four 
table of contents part ii item overhead during is expected to increase by an additional million to million as a result of increased costs associated with strategic business development  information technology and long term incentive plans 
during  we sold our working interest in our coalbed methane gas joint operating agreement to geomet  inc for million and recorded a gain of million 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense decreased by million to million for this decrease was due primarily to the replacement of high interest rate debt with lower interest rate debt 
we expect interest expense for to increase by million to million due primarily to the issuance of million senior notes due in connection with our november  acquisition of timberland in michigan 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for compared to million for this decrease of million is due primarily to a million decline in the operating income of the manufacturing products segment resulting in a lower tax expense of million  a million remeasurement of our deferred tax liability  and the million gain we recognized during the second quarter of from the sale of our coalbed methane gas working interest resulting in a higher tax expense in the prior year of million 
plum creek has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections of the united states internal revenue code  and as such  is generally not subject to corporate level income tax 
however  the company conducts certain non reit activities through various taxable reit subsidiaries  which are subject to corporate level income tax 
these activities include our manufacturing operations  the harvesting and selling of logs  and the development and or sale of some of our higher and better use lands 
furthermore  as we continue to expand our real estate development business we expect a greater percentage of our income will be subject to corporate level income tax 
in addition to corporate level income tax on certain non reit activities conducted through various taxable reit subsidiaries  the company is subject to built in gains tax on certain property dispositions as a consequence of our october  merger with the timber company 
our merger with the timber company involved merging a taxable entity into a nontaxable entity  and as a result  plum creek will generally be subject to corporate level income tax built in gains tax if the company makes a taxable disposition of certain property acquired in the merger within the ten year period following the merger date 
however  the tax is generally not payable to the extent proceeds from such dispositions are reinvested in qualifying like kind replacement property 
during the fourth quarter of  in connection with our merger with the timber company  we wrote off all of the timber company s deferred income tax liability related to timber and timberlands except for million 
the million deferred income tax liability relates to the book tax basis difference of timber and timberlands that were expected to be sold  and subject to  the built in gains tax during the ten year period ending october  during the period october  to december   the million deferred income tax liability was reduced by million in connection with sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  we are required to remeasure the amount of deferred income taxes needed in connection with expected sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax whenever management has better information to make an estimate 
prior to  the company was in the process of expanding its real estate sales and believed it needed million of deferred income taxes for expected sales of timberlands subject to built in gains tax 
during  management revised its prior projection of future sales as well as the extent to which future sales proceeds could be successfully reinvested in like kind property 
based upon the revised projection  management estimated that the company needed million of deferred incomes taxes associated with timberlands acquired in connection with our merger with the timber company 
this estimate was based on projected timberland sales subject to the ability to successfully reinvest proceeds in like kind properties 
therefore  during  we reduced the related deferred tax liability associated with expected sales of timberlands subject to built in gains tax from million to million and correspondingly  recorded a deferred tax benefit of million 
since there is significant judgment in estimating future sales subject to the built in gains tax and our ability to successfully reinvest proceeds in like kind property  these estimates may be revised during the remaining built in gains tax period 
any revised estimate may result in a material adjustment to our deferred tax liability 
gain on sale of properties  net of tax 
in december  the company sold certain subsurface property rights primarily coal reserves  excluding coalbed methane  oil and gas reserves in buchanan county  virginia

when standing timber is sold  the buyer incurs the log and haul costs 
while revenues are higher when the company is responsible for the logging and hauling of timber  costs of sales generally increase by a similar amount 
as a result  the company realizes lower operating income as a percentage of revenue  although operating income is not generally affected 
despite strong lumber and plywood prices during most of  sawlog prices generally held steady due to an abundant supply of logs 
southern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for this decrease was due primarily to the increased percentage of delivered log sales and higher fuel costs

we adopted sfas no 
r on january  the company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective january   using the prospective method described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
currently  the company uses the black scholes merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expects to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model upon the required adoption of sfas no 
r on january  the company does not expect the expense for stock options computed in accordance with sfas no 
r to be materially different than the expense currently computed under sfas no 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were immaterial 
in addition to stock options  the company also grants restricted stock  and dividend equivalents and value management awards  a portion of which may be payable in the company s stock 
grants of both dividend equivalents and value management awards represent awards that are classified and accounted for as liabilities under sfas no 
r 
as a result  the expense recognized over the performance period for both dividend equivalents and value management awards will equal the fair value of an award as of the last day of the performance period times the number of awards that are earned 
furthermore  sfas no 
r requires the quarterly expense recognized during the performance period to be based on the fair value of dividend equivalents and value management awards as of the end of the most recent quarter 
the company does not expect the total expense recognized over the performance period for dividend equivalents and value management awards computed in accordance with sfas no 
r to be materially different than the total expense currently computed under sfas no 
however  as a result of the requirement under sfas no 
r to base the quarterly expense on the current fair value of dividend equivalent and value management awards  the quarterly and annual expense recognized under sfas no 
r could be materially different than the quarterly and annual expense we currently recognize under sfas no

r requires that the total impact of adopting the standard be accounted for as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  with the total impact shown on the income statement net of tax 
based on the provisions of sfas no 
r  the company anticipates this cumulative impact to be approximately a million  net of tax  increase to earnings for the quarter ended march  the cumulative effect adjustment is primarily a result of changes in expense related to the fair value of the dividend equivalent rights and value management awards 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 

sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the new statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  management does not expect that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued financial interpretation fin  which finalized a proposed interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
the interpretation addresses the issue of whether sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize a liability for a legal obligation to perform asset retirement when the asset retirement activities are conditional on a future event  and if so  the timing and valuation of the recognition 
the decision reached by the fasb was that there are no instances where a law or regulation obligates an entity to perform retirement activities but then allows the entity to permanently avoid settling the obligation 
the adoption of fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
opinion no 
provided an exception to its basic measurement principle  fair value  for exchanges of similar production assets 
under opinion no 
 an exchange of a productive asset was based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the fasb eliminated this exception and replaced it with an exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
the fasb believes this statement produces financial reporting that more faithfully represents the economics of nonmonetary asset exchange transactions 
the new statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
