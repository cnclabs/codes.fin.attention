item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general anadarko petroleum corporation s primary line of business is the exploration  development  production and marketing of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
the company s major areas of operations are located in the united states  canada and algeria 
the company is also active in venezuela  qatar and several other countries 
the company s focus is on adding high margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of exploring for and producing oil and gas 
the primary factors that affect the company s results of operations include  among other things  commodity prices for natural gas  crude oil and ngls  production volumes  the company s ability to find additional oil and gas reserves  as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations 
during  anadarko implemented an asset realignment that resulted in the company completing over billion in pretax asset sales of certain non core properties in the latter half of through a series of unrelated transactions 
combined  the divested properties represented about of anadarko s year end proved reserves and about of oil and gas production 
the company used proceeds from these asset sales to reduce debt  repurchase anadarko common stock and otherwise to have funds available for reinvestment in other strategic options

operating results proved reserves anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling  improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties 
mmboe proved reserves beginning of year reserve additions and revisions sales in place production end of year proved developed reserves beginning of year end of year the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end were billion barrels compared to billion barrels at year end and billion barrels at year end crude oil  condensate and ngls comprised about half of the company s proved reserves at year end  and the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
the available data reviewed include  among other things  seismic data  structure and isopach maps  well logs  production tests  material balance calculations  reservoir simulation models  reservoir pressures  individual well and field performance data  individual well and field projections  offset performance data  operating expenses  capital costs and product prices 
revisions are 
table of contents necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
reserve additions and revisions during  the company added mmboe of proved reserves as a result of additions extensions  discoveries  improved recovery and purchases in place and revisions 
additions during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves 
of this amount  mmboe were added as a result of successful drilling in the deepwater gulf of mexico and fields in the north louisiana vernon  east texas bossier  west texas haley and canadian wild river areas and successful improved recovery operations in wyoming 
during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves as a result of successful drilling in its core onshore north american properties and the deepwater gulf of mexico  successful improved recovery operations in wyoming and minor producing property acquisitions 
during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves through successful drilling in its core north american properties  successful improved recovery operations in wyoming and producing property acquisitions 
the company expects the majority of future reserve additions to come from extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in north america and the deepwaters of the gulf of mexico  as well as through improved recovery operations  purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas 
the success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future 
revisions total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
performance revisions of mmboe included the impact of government imposed limits on production in venezuela  as well as a reduction of ngls reserves in algeria resulting from a change in project scope  which improved the value of the project but decreased the ultimate reserves recovery 
north america  which represents of the company s proved reserves  had a mmboe or negative performance revision from the year end proved reserves 
a mmboe revision in canada was almost entirely offset by a mmboe revision in the united states 
price revisions of mmboe were primarily due to the impact of higher year end prices  partially offset by the impact of recalculating the equity barrels under the service contract in venezuela as a result of higher prices 
total revisions for and were mmboe and mmboe  respectively 
revisions in related primarily to performance revisions of the company s reserves at marco polo and other properties  partially offset by positive revisions in other areas 
an analysis of anadarko s proved reserve revisions split between performance and price revisions and shown as a percentage of the previous year end proved reserves is presented in the following graph 
during the year period  anadarko s annual reserve revisions  up or down  have been below of the previous year end proved reserve base for both types of revisions 
the company believes this is an indicator of the validity of the company s processes for estimating reserves 
in the aggregate  over the past decade  the average reserve revision has been a negative and the average performance related reserve revision has been a negative

proved undeveloped reserves to improve investor confidence and provide transparency regarding the company s reserves  anadarko reports the status of its proved undeveloped reserves puds annually 
the company annually reviews all puds  with a particular focus on those puds that have been booked for three or more years  to ensure that there is an appropriate plan for development 
generally  onshore united states puds are converted to proved developed reserves within two years 
certain projects  such as improved oil recovery  arctic development  deepwater development and many international programs  often take longer  sometimes beyond five years 
over of the company s puds booked prior to are in algeria and are being developed according to an algerian government approved plan

table of contents future net cash flows at december   the present value discounted at of future net cash flows from anadarko s proved reserves was billion stated in accordance with the regulations of the sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb 
this present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
the increase of billion or in compared to is primarily due to higher natural gas and oil prices at year end and successful exploration and development drilling in north america 
see supplemental information under item of this form k 
the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
marketing strategies overview the company s marketing department manages sales of its natural gas  crude oil and ngls 
in marketing its production  the company attempts to maximize realized prices while managing credit exposure 
the company s sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale 
the company also purchases natural gas  crude oil and ngls volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near anadarko s production 
these purchases allow the company to aggregate larger volumes  attract larger  more creditworthy customers and facilitate its efforts to maximize prices received for the company s production 
the company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of gas  oil  condensate and ngls 
however  the company does not engage in market making practices nor does it trade in any non energy related commodities 
the company s trading risk position  typically  is a net short position that is offset by the company s natural long position as a producer 
see energy price risk under item a of this form k 
since  all segments of the energy market have experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition  liquidity and credit 
this has been reflected in rating agency credit downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies 
anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third party purchasers  however  in certain situations the company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases 
natural gas natural gas continues to supply a significant portion of north america s energy needs and the company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue 
the tightening of the natural gas supply and demand fundamentals has resulted in extremely volatile natural gas prices  which is expected to continue 
anadarko markets its equity natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets 
anadarko energy services company  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko  is a marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing  risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs 
the company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
the company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative instruments 
in  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s gas production was sold under long term contracts to duke energy corporation duke 
these sales represent  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the contracts that represented most of the and volumes expired during the company integrated the marketing of the natural gas previously sold to duke into its current marketing operations and now sells it to various purchasers at market prices 
volumes sold to duke under the long term contracts were at market prices 
a company anadarko acquired in was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within its gathering  processing and marketing business segment  which was sold in to duke 
most of these agreements were transferred to duke in the disposition 
one agreement 
table of contents was retained  but is managed and operated by duke 
anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the company s natural gas 
as part of the disposition  anadarko pays duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke pays anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement 
the term of the keep whole agreement extends through february the company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to potential decreases in future transportation market values 
while derivatives are intended to reduce the company s exposure to declines in the market value of firm transportation  they also limit the potential to benefit from increases in the market value of firm transportation 
in january  anadarko and duke entered into an agreement to terminate the keep whole agreement prospectively  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent 
the agreement also provides that duke will transfer to anadarko a portfolio of certain gas transportation agreements subject to the keep whole agreement on several us and canadian pipelines  effective april  the company believes the agreement will not have a material effect on its future consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
crude oil  condensate and ngls anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls revenues are derived from production in the us  canada  algeria and other international areas 
most of the company s us crude oil and ngls production is sold under day evergreen contracts with prices based on market indices and adjusted for location  quality and transportation 
most of the company s canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater 
oil from algeria and other international areas is sold by tanker as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners large quantities of premium products like jet and diesel fuel 
the company also purchases and sells third party produced crude oil  condensate and ngls in the company s domestic and international market areas 
included in this strategy is the use of leased ngls storage facilities and various derivative instruments 
gas gathering systems and processing anadarko s investment in gas gathering operations allows the company to better manage its gas production  improve ultimate recovery of reserves  enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities 
the company has invested about million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last years 
the vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from anadarko operated wells 
the company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction of ngls in efficient plants with flexible commitments 
anadarko also processes gas and has interests in two company operated plants 
anadarko s strategy to aggregate gas through company owned and third party gathering systems allows anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the company has significant production 
capital resources and liquidity overview anadarko s primary source of cash during was cash flow from operating activities 
the company used cash flow primarily to fund its capital spending program  repurchase anadarko common stock and pay dividends 
in addition  the company used million of cash from the divestitures to retire debt in the company funded its capital investment programs in and primarily through cash flow from operating activities 
in  the company completed over billion in various pretax asset sales 
the company used proceeds from these asset sales to reduce debt  repurchase anadarko common stock and otherwise to have funds available for reinvestment in other strategic options 
cash flow from operating activities anadarko s cash flow from operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and billion in the increase in cash flow  attributed to higher net realized commodity prices  was partially offset by lower sales volumes resulting from the divestitures 
the increase in cash flow compared to was attributed to the significant increase in commodity prices  partially offset by higher costs and expenses 
fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities 
anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk 
sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity 
table of contents prices in prior years 
anadarko s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations 
capital expenditures the following table shows the company s capital expenditures by category 
millions development exploration property acquisitions development proved exploration unproved total oil and gas costs incurred less asset retirement costs plus asset retirement expenditures total oil and gas capital expenditures gathering and other total oil and gas costs incurred represent capitalized costs related to finding and developing oil and gas reserves 
capital expenditures represent actual cash outlays excluding corporate acquisitions 
anadarko s capital spending increased in and compared to the previous periods 
the increase in includes higher exploration costs in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
additionally  both periods were impacted by rising service and material costs 
the variances in the mix of oil and gas spending reflect the company s available opportunities based on the near term ranking of projects by net asset value potential 
the acquisitions in and primarily relate to exploratory nonproducing leases 
the acquisitions in primarily relate to the acquisition of producing properties and exploratory nonproducing leases

table of contents common stock repurchase program during  a billion stock buyback program announced in was completed and an additional billion stock buyback program was authorized in november 
shares may be repurchased either in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
during and  anadarko purchased million and million shares of common stock for billion and billion  respectively  under these programs 
the company expects to purchase additional shares under the current program as anticipated excess cash flow is realized  however  the repurchase program does not obligate anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time

in  anadarko paid million in dividends to its common stockholders cents per share per quarter 
in  anadarko paid million in dividends to its common stockholders cents per share in the first  second and third quarters and cents per share in the fourth quarter 
anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in the amount of future dividends for anadarko common stock will depend on earnings  financial conditions  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the covenants in the company s credit agreement provide for a maximum capitalization ratio of debt  exclusive of the effect of any noncash writedowns 
as of december   anadarko s capitalization ratio was debt  therefore  retained earnings were not restricted as to the payment of dividends 
in each of the years   and  the company also paid million in preferred stock dividends 
in preferred stock dividends are expected to be million 
outlook the company s goals include continuing to find high margin oil and gas reserves at competitive prices and keeping operating costs at efficient levels 
the company s capital expenditure budget is expected to be approximately billion 
the company has allocated about of the budget to development activities  to exploration activities and the remaining for capitalized interest  overhead and other items 
a significant portion of capital spending in is expected to focus on unconventional tight gas plays onshore north america  primarily in north louisiana  west texas  east texas and alberta  canada 
in the eastern gulf of mexico  facilities will be installed to link several anadarko operated natural gas discoveries with the independence hub 
in the central gulf of mexico  the company expects to bring several high volume wells on line at the marco polo hub facility and participate in exploration or delineation wells in the foldbelt area 
outside north america  the international program includes continued development of block discoveries in algeria and exploration activity in algeria  qatar  indonesia  tunisia and west africa  as well as activities within other potential new venture areas 
anadarko s strategy with respect to its capital program is to maintain a steady level of activity despite the volatile nature of commodity prices 
this is accomplished by setting capital activity at levels that are self funding 
when prices exceed targeted levels  as is currently the case  costs tend to increase as well 
the cash generated in excess of the amount needed to fund the steady level of capital activity is systematically returned to shareholders through stock repurchases  used to build additional balance sheet strength through debt reductions  or otherwise made available for reinvestment in other strategic options 
alternatively  when prices are below the company s targeted levels  anadarko could draw upon its strengthened debt capacity to fund a steady level of activity 
the company s capital spending noted above was determined at an investment level that is less than cash flow using estimated full year nymex prices  therefore  cash flow in is expected to be higher than capital spending 
if capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow  funds are supplemented as needed by short term borrowings under commercial paper  money market loans or credit agreement borrowings 
to facilitate such borrowings  the company has in place a million committed credit agreement  which is supplemented by 
table of contents various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates 
as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility 
it is the company s policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities 
the company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets 
to facilitate such financings  the company may file shelf registration statements in advance with the sec 
the company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
the company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including property sales and additional borrowings  to secure funds when needed 
in february  the company s board of directors authorized a two for one split of the common stock 
the stock split will require that shareholders authorize the issuance of additional shares for this purpose at the company s may  annual meeting 
if approved  anadarko s transfer agent will deliver to each holder of record at the close of business on may   one additional share for every share of common stock held on may  anadarko s common stock should begin trading on a post split basis on may  based on year end shares outstanding  anadarko would have approximately million shares of common stock outstanding following the proposed stock split

during  anadarko entered into various agreements to secure the necessary drilling rigs to execute its drilling strategy over the next several years 
a review of the company s worldwide deepwater drilling inventory  along with the tightening deepwater and onshore rig market  led anadarko to secure the drilling rigs it needs to execute its strategy 
nearly two thirds of the proposed contracted rig time is intended to delineate and develop discoveries  with the remainder for high potential exploration 
the company believes these rig contracting efforts offer compelling economics and facilitate its drilling strategy 
in addition to addressing the cost side of the equation  the company also hedged a portion of its forecasted crude oil sales for the time period covered by the rig commitments to help manage the risk of potential declines in market based rig rates 
the company also has million in commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements for a production platform and equipment  buildings  facilities and aircraft 
during  anadarko and a group of energy companies atwater valley producers group executed agreements with a third party to design  construct  install and own independence hub  a semi submersible platform in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
the platform structure  expected to be mechanically complete in late  will be operated by anadarko 
first production from anadarko s discoveries to be processed on the facility is expected in the second half of the agreements require a monthly demand charge of about million for five years beginning at the time of mechanical completion  a processing fee based upon production throughput and a transportation fee based upon pipeline throughput 
since the company s obligation related to the agreements begins at the time of mechanical completion  the table above does not include any amounts related to these agreements 
the agreements do not contain any purchase options  purchase obligations or value guarantees

table of contents marketing activities anadarko has entered into various transportation and storage agreements in order to access markets and provide flexibility for the sale of its natural gas and crude oil in certain areas 
the above table includes transportation and storage commitments of million  comprised of million in the united states and million in canada 
lng facility natural gas delivery commitments in  the company entered into precedent agreements with a third party in order to secure delivery of natural gas from a lng facility anadarko is constructing in nova scotia  canada  called bear head  to prospective markets in eastern canada and the northeastern united states 
the third party has agreed to expand the capacity of its pipeline so it can accommodate the projected natural gas volumes from bear head 
the precedent agreements signed by the parties establish the conditions on which the third party will proceed with design  regulatory approvals and construction of the expansion facilities  and be obligated to transport a specified volume of gas 
as a condition to entering into the precedent agreements  anadarko executed firm service agreements for transportation on the canadian and united states portions of the pipeline 
upon satisfaction of the obligations under the precedent agreements  the initial term of the transportation agreements is years 
based upon the terms  anadarko projects that annual demand charges due under the firm transportation service agreements may be in the range of million to million per year for the first five years from commencement of full service  potentially escalating by up to in year six and in year seven  exclusive of fuel and surcharges 
no later than the eighth year from commencement of full service  rates under the agreements are to be redetermined based on then current conditions 
the precedent agreements contain certain termination rights 
the company s potential reimbursement obligation under the precedent agreements increases over time as the third party incurs pre service costs 
according to the original schedule provided by the third party  this reimbursement obligation is expected to increase from about million at december  to million at december   up to a maximum of million in may due to the number of factors that need to materialize in order to reasonably project the cumulative obligation and the existence of termination rights  the table above does not include any amounts related to these agreements

margin deposits are required of the company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits 
given the company s hedge position and price volatility  the company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements 
during  the company s margin deposit requirements have ranged from zero to million 
the company had margin deposits of million outstanding at december  other in  the company made contributions of million to its funded pension plans  million to its unfunded pension plans and million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans 
contributions to the funded plans increase the plan assets while contributions to unfunded plans are used for current benefit payments 
in  the company expects to contribute about million to its funded pension plans  million to its unfunded pension plans and million to its unfunded other postretirement benefit plans 
future contributions to funded pension plans will be affected by actuarial assumptions  market performance and individual year funding decisions 
the company is unable to accurately predict what contribution levels will be required beyond for the pension plans  however  they are expected to be at levels lower than those made in the company expects future payments for other postretirement benefit plans to continue at slightly increasing levels above those made in during  proceeds from the sale of future royalty revenues were accounted for as deferred revenues and classified as liabilities on the balance sheet 
these deferred revenues will be amortized to other sales on a unit of revenue basis over the year term of the related agreement 
the third party relies solely on the royalty payments to recover their investment and  as such  has the risk of the royalties not being sufficient to recover their investment over the term of the agreement

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates financial statements and use of estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes  fair values and determination of proved reserves 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves  as defined by sec regulation s x rule a i  ii  iii  and  are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the dd a rate calculation and the financial statements 
under the terms of anadarko s risk service contract with the national oil company of venezuela  anadarko earns a fee that is translated into barrels of oil based on current prices economic interest method 
this means that higher oil prices reduce the company s reported production volumes and reserves from that project and lower oil prices increase reported production volumes and reserves 
production volume and reserve changes due to the prices used to determine the company s economic interest have no impact on the value of the project 
properties and equipment the company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the sec 
under this method of accounting  the costs of unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher dd a rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
costs excluded properties and equipment include costs that are excluded from costs being depreciated or amortized 
oil and gas costs excluded represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which the company owns a direct interest 
these unproved property costs include nonproducing leasehold  geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs 
anadarko excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate for that country 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties 

table of contents significant properties  primarily comprised of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks  alaska  the land grant and other international areas  are individually evaluated each quarter by the company s exploration and engineering staff 
nonproducing leases and geological and geophysical costs are transferred to the dd a pool based on the progress of the company s exploration program 
exploration drilling costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties  which is generally based on drilling results 
the company has a to year exploration and evaluation program for the land grant acreage 
costs are transferred to the dd a pool as they are evaluated 
the land grant s mineral interests both working and royalty interests are owned by the company in perpetuity 
insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the united states and canada 
nonproducing leases  along with related geological and geophysical costs  are transferred to the dd a pool over a three to five year period based on the lease term 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties 
other costs excluded from depreciation represent major construction projects that are in progress 
derivative instruments current accounting rules require that all derivative instruments  other than those that meet the normal purchase and sale exception  be recorded at fair value 
quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if quotations are not available  management s best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or on valuation techniques 
the company s derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over the counter market 
the fair values of the derivative instruments are based on quoted market prices  option pricing models and other internally developed valuation models 
option fair values are based on the black scholes option pricing model and verified against the applicable counterparty s fair values 
the fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis differentials 
basis differentials are the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the nymex gas futures contract price 
management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to a lack of liquidity 
accordingly  the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on an internally developed model that utilizes historical natural gas basis differentials 
derivative accounting rules require that fair value changes of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be reported in current period earnings  rather than in the period the derivatives are settled and or the hedged transaction is settled 
this can result in significant volatility in earnings 
the company prefers to utilize hedge accounting for those derivative instruments that are used to manage price risk associated with its forecasted oil and gas production  foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rates 
however  some of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 
derivative accounting rules are complex and subject to interpretation in their application 
interpretative guidance continues to evolve and  as a result  it is possible the company s accounting policy for derivative instruments could be modified in the future 
income taxes the amount of income taxes recorded by the company requires the interpretation of complex rules and regulations of various taxing jurisdictions throughout the world 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities for all significant temporary differences  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
the company routinely assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and reduces such assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company routinely assesses potential tax contingencies and  if required  establishes accruals for such contingencies 
the accruals for deferred tax assets and liabilities are subject to a significant amount of judgment by company management and are reviewed and adjusted routinely based on changes in facts and circumstances 
although company management believes its tax accruals are adequate  material changes in these accruals may occur in the future  based on the progress of ongoing tax audits  changes in legislation and resolution of pending tax matters

in  the venezuelan ministry of energy and petroleum announced that all osas concluded by pdvsa between and will be subject to renegotiation 
the company and petrobras signed a transitory agreement with pdvsa in september under this agreement  the parties are currently negotiating the conversion of the osa to a company in which anadarko  petrobras and pdvsa will each have an interest

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks are fluctuations in energy prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these fluctuations can affect revenues and the cost of operating  investing and financing activities 
the company s risk management policy provides for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks 
the types of derivative instruments utilized by the company include futures  swaps  options and fixed price physical delivery contracts 
the volume of derivative instruments utilized by the company is governed by the risk management policy and can vary from year to year

energy price risk the company s most significant market risk is the pricing for natural gas  crude oil  ngls and the firm transportation keep whole agreement 
management expects energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices decline significantly  revenues and cash flow would significantly decline 
the company has substantially more exposure to unfavorable changes in energy prices in than it did in prior years due to a decreased level of derivative instruments in place 
in  anadarko had derivative instruments in place to reduce price risk on about of its oil and gas production 
for  derivative instruments in place to reduce price risk on its forecasted oil and gas production are less than 
in addition  a noncash writedown of the company s oil and gas properties could be required under full cost accounting rules if prices declined significantly  even if it is only for a short period of time 
below is a sensitivity analysis of the company s commodity price related derivative instruments 
derivative instruments held for non trading purposes the company had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with future equity production of bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of crude oil as of december  excluding physical delivery fixed price contracts not accounted for as derivative instruments 
as of december   the company had a net unrealized loss of million on these derivative instruments 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in underlying commodity prices would result in an additional loss on these derivative instruments of approximately million 
however  this loss would be substantially offset by a gain in the value of that portion of the company s equity production that is hedged 
derivative instruments held for trading purposes as of december   the company had a net unrealized gain of million gains of million and losses of million on derivative financial instruments entered into for trading purposes and a net unrealized loss of million losses of million and gains of million on physical delivery contracts entered into for trading purposes and accounted for as derivatives 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a increase in underlying commodity prices  the potential additional loss on these derivative instruments would be million 
firm transportation keep whole agreement a company anadarko acquired in was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program which was sold in to duke 
as part of the disposition  anadarko pays duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke pays anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement 
the term of the keep whole agreement extends through february the company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure under the keep whole agreement to potential decreases in future transportation market values 
due to decreased liquidity  the use of derivative instruments to manage this risk is generally limited to the forward months 
as of december   other current assets included million and other long term liabilities included million related to this agreement 
as of december   accounts payable included million and other long term liabilities included million related to this agreement 
a unfavorable change in the december  natural gas basis differentials would result in a loss of million on the keep whole agreement 
the future gain or loss from this agreement cannot be accurately predicted

interest rate risk anadarko is also exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of the company s floating rate obligations 
the company believes the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates may have on interest expense or the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments is not material 
the company did not have any derivative instruments related to interest rate risk in place as of december  foreign currency risk the company has canadian subsidiaries which use the canadian dollar as their functional currency 
the company s other international subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
a canadian subsidiary has notes and debentures denominated in us dollars 
the potential foreign currency remeasurement impact on earnings from a unfavorable change in the december  canadian exchange rate against the us dollar would be a loss of about million based on the outstanding debt at december  for additional information related to foreign currency risk see note financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k
