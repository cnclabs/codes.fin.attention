item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained in item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we derive our revenues from the sale of software licenses and related services that help consumer facing organizations create an interactive experience for their customers and partners via the internet and other channels 
our software licenses are priced based on either the size of the customer implementation or site license terms 
services revenues are derived from fees for professional services  training  support and maintenance  and application hosting 
professional services include implementation  custom application development and project and technical consulting 
we bill professional service fees primarily on a time and materials basis or in limited cases  on a fixed price schedule defined in our contracts 
support and maintenance arrangements are priced based on the level of services provided 
generally  customers are entitled to receive software updates  maintenance releases as well as on line and telephone technical support for an annual maintenance fee 
training is billed as services are provided 
revenue from application hosting services is recognized monthly as the services are provided 
we market and sell our products worldwide through our direct sales force  systems integrators  technology alliances and original equipment manufacturers 
as of december  we had offices in the united states  united kingdom  france and northern ireland with sales personnel in the united states  united kingdom and france 
revenues from customers outside the united states accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  research and development costs  restructuring expenses  the impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  known trends or events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the 
table of contents carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition not only is revenue recognition a key component of our results of operations  the timing of our revenue recognition also determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions 
in measuring revenues  we follow the specific guidelines of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition and sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists via a signed license agreement  physical or electronic delivery has occurred including the availability of license keys or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable representing amounts that are due unconditionally with no future obligations under customary payment terms  and collectibility is probable 
in accordance with sop and sop  revenues from software product license agreements are recognized upon execution of a license agreement and delivery of the software  provided that the fee is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
if conditions for acceptance are required subsequent to delivery  revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance if such acceptance is not deemed to be perfunctory 
in multiple element arrangements  we use the residual value method in accordance with sop and sop revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements which qualify for separate element accounting treatment is allocated to each undelivered element using the relative fair values of those elements based on vendor specific objective evidence with the remaining value assigned to the delivered element  the software license 
many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts 
consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from software licenses because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
consequently  license fee revenue is generally recognized when the product is shipped 
revenues from software maintenance or hosting agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance or hosting period  which for application hosting and support and maintenance is typically one year 
customers who have purchased our product licenses and have also entered into a hosting agreement typically have a contractual right to cancel the hosting agreement with a minimum notice period 
we account for these transactions in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  application of aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  and generally recognize the product license fee upon delivery of the software license because we have established the fair value of a vendor specific objective evidence of hosting services  the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalties and it is feasible for the customer to run the software on its own hardware or contract with another party to host the software 
we enter into reseller arrangements that typically provide for sublicense fees payable to us based upon a percentage of our list price 
revenues are recognized under reseller agreements based upon actual sales to the resellers 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return or price protection 
revenues from professional service arrangements are recognized as the services are performed  provided that amounts due from customers are fixed or determinable and deemed collectible by management 
amounts collected prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are reflected as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue primarily consists of advance payments related to support and maintenance  hosting and service agreements 

table of contents we principally charge for professional services revenues on a time and material basis 
from time to time we enter into fixed price service arrangements 
in those circumstances in which services are essential to the functionality of the software  we apply the percentage of completion method  and in those situations when only professional services are provided  we apply the proportional performance method 
both of these methods require that we track the effort expended and the effort expected to complete a project 
the most significant assumption by management in accounting for this type of arrangement is the estimated time to complete the project 
significant deviations in actual results from management s estimates with respect to one or more projects could significantly affect the timing of revenue recognition and could result in significant losses on these projects 
to date  our actual results in completing projects have not deviated significantly from management s estimates of the time to complete those projects 
accounts receivable and bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which specifies that costs incurred internally to develop computer software products should be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is reached for the product 
once technological feasibility is reached  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is made available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility is established 
we believe that the time period from reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is reached are not material  and accordingly  all such costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
restructuring expenses during    and  we recorded net restructuring charges benefits of million  million  million  million and million  respectively  pertaining to the closure and consolidation of excess facilities  impairment of assets as discussed below  employee severance benefits and settlement of certain contractual obligations 
these charges and benefits were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  restructuring and impairment charges 
the and charges were recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  sfas  and sab in determining the charges to record  we made certain estimates and judgments surrounding the amounts ultimately to be paid for the actions we have taken 
at december   there were various accruals recorded for termination benefits and lease obligations  which may be adjusted periodically for either resolution of certain contractual commitments or changes in estimates of sublease income or the period of time the facilities will be vacant and subleased 
although we do not anticipate additional significant changes to our restructuring accruals  the actual costs may differ from those recorded in the event that the subleasing assumptions require adjustment 
such changes in estimates have had a material impact on our operating results in the past and could have a material impact on our operating results in the future 
to estimate the costs related to our restructuring efforts  management made its best estimates of the most likely expected outcomes of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
these estimates principally related to costs attributable to excess leased facilities and included estimates of future sublease income  future 
table of contents net operating expenses of the facilities  brokerage commissions and other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates related to the timing and extent of future sublease income that would reduce our lease obligations 
included in our accrued restructuring balance at december  was estimated sublease income of  we based our estimate of sublease income on the status of current negotiations with a potential subtenant and current market conditions and rental rates for this location 
actual results may vary significantly from this estimate  depending in part on our ability to obtain approval of the sublease from the landlord 
we review the status of our restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record adjustments to our restructuring obligations in our financial statements for such quarter based on management s current best estimates 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including intangible assets we review our long lived assets  including intangible assets subject to amortization  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount factors 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  based upon the pattern in which the expected benefits will be realized  or on a straight line basis  whichever is greater 
as a result of our restructuring activities in   and  we evaluated the realizability of our long lived assets including fixed assets and leasehold improvements related to our restructured facility leases 
in   and we deemed leasehold improvements of approximately   and  respectively  to be impaired due to the fact we had vacated the related office locations  and that the estimated sublease income at the location was not sufficient to recover the assets carrying value 
in  we determined that approximately  of computer equipment and furniture and fixtures were impaired as a result of our decision to abandon the assets because of the termination of employees and related closures of offices 
also in  we determined that  of purchased software was impaired due to our revised product development strategy 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company annually evaluates goodwill for impairment as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows 
because the company has one reporting segment under sfas  the company utilizes the entity wide approach for assessing goodwill for impairment and compares the company s market value to its net book value to determine if impairment exists 
no impairment of goodwill resulted from the company s evaluation of goodwill in any of the fiscal years presented 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly and adjust the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
at december  and  we have provided a 
table of contents full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of their realizability 
the valuation allowance increased million to million in from million in the primary reason for the increase in the valuation allowance is due to an increase of million related to tax credits and other temporary differences not previously included in gross deferred tax assets and a decrease of million utilized to offset current year book income 
if substantial changes in our ownership have occurred or should occur  or if we determine that there were ownership changes at primus prior to our acquisition thereof  as defined by section of the internal revenue code  there could be annual limitations on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be realized in future periods 
in addition  we have provided for potential amounts due in various foreign tax jurisdictions 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
during and  we reversed previously accrued taxes of  and  respectively  for foreign locations  due to the closure of the statute of limitations  or as a result of changes in our estimates of potential amounts due  in those locations

since our focus has been on e commerce and service applications  and through our primus acquisition  solutions that enable our customers to deliver a superior customer experience via contact centers  information technology help desks  web intranet and internet self service and electronic communication channels 
the increase in revenues compared to was also partly attributable to our new application hosting services  which generated revenues of approximately million in compared to million in we expect revenue growth in resulting in revenues in the range of million to million 
in total revenues decreased to million from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to longer sales cycles  delayed purchasing decisions and reduced information technology related spending by our customers 
additionally  the transition in our marketing and sales focus from infrastructure products to application products  particularly in the e commerce and self service area  contributed to the decrease in revenues  as sales of our new application products were not initially sufficient to offset the reduction in sales of our older infrastructure products 
revenues generated from international customers decreased to million or of total revenues in  from million  or of total revenues  in and from million  or of total revenues  in during the fourth quarter of  one customer accounted for of total revenues

product license revenues generated from international customers decreased to million in from million in the decrease in international revenues was due primarily due to timing of certain deals 
product license revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to longer sales cycles  delayed purchasing decisions and reduced information technology related spending by our customers  which affected both our infrastructure products business and our application products business and resulted in reduced sales volume in terms of both the number and size of transactions with customers 
additionally  the transition in our marketing and sales focus from infrastructure products to application products  particularly in the e commerce and self service area  contributed to the decrease in revenues 
these decreases in revenues from our historical businesses were partially offset by two months of primus revenues 
the decline in product license revenues in as compared to is attributable to reduced sales volume of both the number and size of transactions with customers 

table of contents product license revenues as a percentage of total revenues for  and were  and  respectively 
we expect this percentage to be in the range of to in our resellers generally receive a discount from our list prices 
the extent of any discount is based on negotiated contractual agreements between us and the reseller 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return  price protection or favorable payment terms 
we rely upon resellers to market and sell our products to governmental entities and to customers in geographic regions where it is not cost effective for us to reach clients directly 
during  we had approximately active resellers 
reseller revenues and the percentage of revenues from resellers can vary significantly from period to period depending on the revenues from large deals  if any  closed through this channel during any period 
no reseller accounted for more than of our revenues for the years ended  or the table below sets forth product revenues recognized from reseller arrangements for the years ended  and reseller revenues percent of product license revenues services revenues services revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to new service revenues from the acquisition of primus  including application hosting services of million in compared to million in support and maintenance revenues were of total services revenues in and support and maintenance revenues  in absolute dollars  were higher during due to the addition of primus active support and maintenance customer base  offset by a portion of existing atg customers terminating their support coverage 
we expect support and maintenance revenues to increase in because of increases in new maintenance revenues associated with expected product revenues  slightly offset by a portion of existing customers terminating their support coverage 
services revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was attributable to increased professional services revenues and new services revenues from the acquisition of primus  offset by decreased support and maintenance revenues 
support and maintenance revenues were of total services revenues in as compared to in support and maintenance revenues  in absolute dollars  were lower in due to a combination of declining product revenues in prior periods and some customers electing to decrease or terminate their support coverage

the increase in gross margin percentage in compared to is due to higher product revenues in and lower salaries and royalties of  offset by an increase in amortization expense of  related to developed technology from the primus acquisition 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in compared to is due to amortization expense of  related to developed technology from the primus acquisition 
cost of services revenues cost of services revenues includes salary and other related costs for our professional services  technical support staff and hosting services as well as third party contractor expenses 
cost of services revenues will vary significantly from year to year depending on the level of professional services staffing  the effective utilization rates of our professional services staff  the mix of services performed  including product license technical support services  the extent to which these services are performed by us or by third party contractors and the level of third party contractor fees 
cost of services revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in service revenues of for the year and a full year of hosting activities  resulting in an increase in salaries and benefits and increased use of third party contractors 
our use of outside contractors increased by million compared to cost of services revenues increased slightly to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and outside professional services costs  offset by reduced rent expense  operating costs and infrastructure expenses as a result of our restructuring efforts 
our use of outside contractors increased by  compared to gross margin on services revenues for  and  gross margin on services revenues was  or million   or million  and  or million  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in compared with was attributed primarily to continued use of third party contractors to control costs 
gross margin remained relatively flat in compared with we expect gross margin on services revenues in to be in the to range 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and related costs to support product development  as well as costs related to outsourcing services 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed as research and development in the period incurred 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our use of third party offshore contractors and to higher third party and consultant fees  which increased by million during year ended december  
table of contents research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in our workforce and resulting decreases in salaries and related benefits and to a lesser extent  to reduced operating expenses as a result of our historical restructuring efforts 
the decrease was offset  in part  by an increase in the use of off shore developers

we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in  but will remain consistent  as compared with  as a percentage of total revenues 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel  travel  public relations  amortization of intangible assets and marketing materials and events 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of  during in the amortization expense related to an intangible asset for customer relationships from the primus acquisition in november this increase was offset by cost saving initiatives that resulted in a reduction in the workforce of our sales and marketing groups  reduced recruitment fees and training costs  and a reduction in our spending on marketing programs along with a decrease in operating expenses resulting from our restructuring efforts 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of our sales and marketing group  a reduction in our spending on marketing programs and a reduction in commissions from decreased product revenues 
compensation  commissions and benefits costs decreased by approximately  and marketing and promotional expenses decreased by approximately million  with the remainder of the net decrease caused by a decrease in operating expenses resulting from our restructuring efforts 
these decreases were offset in part by  of amortization of an intangible asset related to customer relationships from the primus acquisition 
for  and  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and  respectively 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will remain consistent  as compared with  as a percentage of total revenues 
however sales and marketing expenses can fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues depending on economic conditions  program spending  the rate at which new sales personnel become productive and the level of revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for operations and finance employees and legal and accounting fees

general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in approximately of the decrease was related to a decrease in our workforce  of the decrease was the result of lower hiring and training costs with the remainder related to decreases in rent expense and facilities related charges and other operating expenses resulting from our restructuring efforts and cost containment initiatives  offset by an increase in professional services comprising legal and accounting costs primarily due to compliance with the internal control requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents for  and  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and  respectively 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will decrease slightly  as compared with  as a percentage of total revenues 
restructuring charges benefit during each of the last five years we have taken restructuring actions to realign our operating expenses and facilities with the requirements of our business and current market conditions 
these actions have included closure and consolidation of excess facilities  reductions in the number of our employees  abandonment or disposal of tangible assets and settlement of contractual obligations 
in connection with each of these actions we have recorded restructuring charges  based in part upon our estimates of the costs ultimately to be paid for the actions we have taken 
when changes or circumstances result in changes in our estimates relating to our accrued restructuring costs  we reflect these changes as additional charges or benefits in the period in which the change of estimate occurs 
for detailed information about our restructuring activities and related costs and accruals  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
during  we recorded a net restructuring charge of  consisting of million of costs associated with the relocation of our san francisco office and reduction of space we occupy in san francisco and other facilities related charges  which were partially offset by a net benefit of  resulting from the net favorable effect of changes of estimates relating to costs accrued in connection with our prior restructuring activities 
the principal components of this  net benefit were a  reduction in estimated subleasing costs related to our restructuring actions  as a result of our re evaluation of the financial condition of our subtenants and their ability to meet their financial obligations to us  and a  reduction in estimated facilities related costs attributable to our restructuring actions  as a result of our execution of a sublease agreement for the vacated space 
these favorable changes more than offset net unfavorable changes in estimates in the aggregate net amount of approximately  relating to our restructuring actions in various prior periods 
in  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million  consisting of million of facilities related costs and million of employee severance and benefits costs related to our restructuring actions  partially offset by  of net benefits resulting from changes in estimates relating primarily to our  and facility related restructuring actions 
the million of facilities related costs were primarily comprised of  for an operating lease related to idle office space net of assumptions for vacancy period and sublease income based on the then current real estate market data   of leasehold improvements written down to their fair value and  of prepaid rent related to the abandoned space  which was recorded as part of prior lease settlements 
the million for severance and benefit costs related to cost reduction actions taken to terminate employees or of our worldwide employee base 
in  we recorded a net restructuring benefit of million  consisting of charges of million for facilities related costs and million for employee severance benefits costs related to restructuring actions in the second and third quarters of  which were more than offset by million of net benefits resulting from changes in estimates relating to prior restructuring actions  primarily consisting of a million benefit attributable to the settlement during of our obligations relating to five leased premises vacated in connection with our restructuring actions and a million benefit related to a lease vacated in connection with our restructuring 
these benefits were offset by additional charges primarily for other leases of million related to our action and million related to our action 
other changes in estimates were recorded in as of december   we had an accrued restructuring liability of million primarily for facility related costs 
the long term portion of the accrued restructuring liability was million 
at december   we had lease arrangements related to seven abandoned facilities from our restructuring actions 
one of these leases is the subject of a lease settlement arrangement under which we are obligated to make payments through the lease agreements with respect to the other six facilities are ongoing 
of these locations  the restructuring accrual for the reading  uk location is net of assumed sub lease 
table of contents income  as no sub lease agreement had been executed by december  the restructuring accrual for all other locations is net of the contractual amounts due under an executed sub lease agreement or there is no assumed sub lease income included in the accrual 
all locations for which we have recorded restructuring charges have been exited  and thus our plans with respect to these leases have been completed

the tax provision recorded in relates to foreign taxes 
during and we reversed previously accrued taxes of  and  respectively  for foreign locations due to the closure of statute of limitations  or as a result of changes in our estimates of potential amounts due in those locations 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to facilities  employee infrastructure and working capital requirements 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the public and private sales of equity securities  and commercial credit facilities 
more recently  we have been able to fund our cash requirements in part from operations 
at february   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities was million in this consisted primarily of net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a non cash restructuring charge of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to improved collection efforts  offset by payments of accrued restructuring costs of million  a decrease in deferred revenues of million and payments of accounts payable of million

our investing activities for consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million and net proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of million  along with net cash acquired in the primus acquisition of million 
our lease in cambridge expires in and we may find it beneficial to move our headquarters  creating a requirement for additional leasehold improvements 
therefore  we expect that capital expenditures  including the additional leasehold improvements  will total approximately million in net cash provided by financing activities was million in  representing proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options aggregating million  offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital leases aggregating million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  consisting of proceeds from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan of million  offset by principal payments on notes payable of million 
accounts receivable and days sales outstanding our accounts receivable balance and days sales outstanding  or dso  as of december   and were as follows in thousands except dso data dso revenue accounts receivable the significant improvement in dso as of december  compared to is due to the impact of acquiring primus accounts receivable balance late in with only two months of primus revenues in to offset the accounts receivable and product license deals that closed before year end but were not recognized into revenue during credit facility we have a million revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank the bank which provides for borrowings of up to million 
the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
the line of credit is secured by all of our tangible and intangible intellectual and personal property and is subject to financial covenants including liquidity coverage and profitability 
the credit facility required net profitability of at least for the fourth quarter of in february  we entered into the ninth loan modification agreement the ninth amendment  which amended the amended and restated loan and security agreement dated as of june  under the ninth amendment  the profitability covenant was revised to require net income of at least for the 
table of contents quarter ending march  and net income of at least  for the quarter ended june  and for each quarter thereafter through the duration of the credit facility 
our ability to meet these profitability covenants may be affected by our adoption of sfas r  effective january  we estimate that stock based compensation expense related to share based payments to employees will have an impact of at least million to million on fiscal results related to the unvested portion of options granted prior to january   options granted after december  and employee stock purchase plan transactions after december  this estimate is based on our current level of employees and related unvested stock options  expected level of employees and stock options to be granted in  and participation in our employee stock purchase plan 
we are also required to maintain unrestricted and unencumbered cash  which includes cash equivalents and marketable securities  of greater than million at the end of each month through the duration of the credit facility to avoid additional bank fees and expenses  we are required to maintain unrestricted cash  which includes cash equivalents and marketable securities  at the bank in an amount equal to two times the amount of obligations outstanding  which includes letters of credit that have been issued but not drawn upon  under the loan agreement 
in the event our cash balances at the bank fall below this amount  we will be required to pay fees and expenses to compensate the bank for lost income 
at december   we were in compliance with all related financial covenants 
in the event that we do not comply with the financial covenants within the line of credit or defaults on any of its provisions  the bank s significant remedies include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable  which could include requiring us to cash collateralize our outstanding letters of credit lcs  ceasing to advance money or extend credit for our benefit  applying to the obligations any balances and deposits held by us or any amount held by the bank owing to or for the credit of our account  and  putting a hold on any deposit account held as collateral 
if the agreement expires  is not extended  the bank will require outstanding lcs at that time to be cash secured on terms acceptable to the bank 
the revolving line of credit  as amended  expires on january  while there were no outstanding borrowings under the facility at december   the bank had issued lcs totaling million on our behalf  which are supported by this facility 
the lcs have been issued in favor of various landlords to secure obligations under our facility leases pursuant to leases expiring through january the line of credit bears interest at the bank s prime rate at december  
as of december   approximately million was available under the facility 
contractual obligations at december  our contractual cash obligations were as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years lease commitments notes payable total of the million in future minimum lease payments  million is included in the company s accrued restructuring charges 
the million was reduced to million restructuring charge after taking into consideration estimated sublease income  contracted sublease income  vacancy periods and operating costs of the various subleased properties 
we believe that there will not be any material real estate lease settlements beyond those completed to date 
as such  we believe that our balance of million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   along with other working capital and cash expected to be generated by our operations will allow us to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
however  our actual cash requirements will depend on many factors  including particularly  overall economic conditions both domestically and abroad 
we may seek additional external funds through public or private securities offerings  
table of contents strategic alliances or other financing sources 
there can be no assurance that if we seek external funding  it will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  sfas r 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods 
a modified prospective method recognizes compensation cost beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate their historical financial statements based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a for all prior periods presented or b for prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
sfas r is required to be adopted effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal we will adopt sfas r in fiscal year on january  using the modified prospective method 
we estimate that the stock based compensation expense related to share based payments to employees will have an impact of at least million to million on fiscal results related to the unvested portion of options granted prior to january   options granted after december  and employee stock purchase plan transactions after december  this estimate is based on our current level of employees and related unvested stock options  expected level of employees and stock options to be granted in  and participation in our employee stock purchase plan in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of investment grade money market funds  corporate obligations and government obligations with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
these held to maturity securities are subject to interest rate risk 
however  a change in interest rates would not have a material impact to the fair values of these securities primarily due to their short maturity and our intent to hold the securities to maturity 
there have been no significant changes since december  the majority of our operations are based in the us  and accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of foreign currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposures relate to our short term intercompany balances with our foreign subsidiaries and accounts receivable valued in the united kingdom in us dollars 
our primary foreign subsidiaries have functional currencies denominated in the british pound and euro  and foreign denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured each reporting period with any exchange gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
based on currency exposures existing at december   a movement in foreign exchange rates would not expose us to significant gains or losses in earnings or cash flows 
we may use derivative instruments to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  at december   we had no outstanding derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes
