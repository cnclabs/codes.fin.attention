item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading worldwide provider of spa services 
we sell our services and products to cruise passengers and at resort and day spas primarily in the united states  the caribbean  the pacific  asia and mexico 
payments to cruise lines  resort spa owners and day spa landlords are based on a percentage of our revenues and  in certain cases  a minimum annual rental or a combination of both 
in  we completed the disposition of our discontinued day spa operations  leaving us with our two elemis flagship luxury day spas one in london  england and one in coral gables  florida 
our revenues are generated principally from our cruise ship operations 
accordingly  our success and our growth is dependent to a significant extent on the success and growth of the travel and leisure industry in general  and on the cruise industry in particular 
the cruise industry is subject to significant risks that could affect our results of operations 
among other things  accidents and other incidents involving cruise ships  other unscheduled withdrawals of ships from service  delays in new ship introductions  environmental violations by cruise lines  restricted access of cruise ships to environmentally sensitive regions  hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  adverse publicity resulting from unfavorable incidents involving cruise ships or passengers and possible increases in fuel costs could materially adversely impact the cruise industry 
our resort spas are dependent on the resort hotel industry for their success 
the resort hotel industry is subject to risks that are  in many ways  similar to that of the cruise industry  including the following risks changes in the national  regional and local economic and or political climate including major national or international terrorism  hostilities or other events  local conditions  including oversupply of hotel properties  illnesses  labor unrest  changes in popular travel patterns  adverse weather conditions  airline route scheduling and other causes of reduced hotel occupancy 
a significant factor in our financial results is the amounts we are required to pay under our agreements with the cruise lines and resorts 
certain cruise line agreements provide for increases in percentages of revenues and other amounts payable by us over the terms of those agreements 
these payments may also be increased under new agreements with cruise lines and resorts venue operators that replace expiring agreements 
in general  we have experienced increases in these payments as a percentage of revenues upon entering into new agreements with cruise lines 
since our revenues are generated primarily from our cruise ship and resort spa operations  our success depends to a significant extent on the success of the cruise line and resort industries 
from late through  the cruise line and resort industries had experienced certain declines as a result of various factors impacting the demand for vacations including  among other things  fears of terrorist attacks  such as those of september   and potential and actual armed hostilities in iraq and elsewhere  recessionary economic conditions worldwide  outbreaks of illnesses on ships and in countries where we operate resort spas such as sars and bird flu as well as the adverse publicity surrounding these and other events 
in addition  increased competition for cruise ship passengers resulting from increased passengers capacities among the large cruise lines  accentuated by the foregoing factors  had caused cruise lines to discount fares in order to increase passenger counts 
we b elieve that passengers who cruise solely due to fare discounts may reflect their cost consciousness by not spending on board on discretionary items  such as our products and services 
in the first quarter of  the cruise industry reported that bookings during the peak booking period the so called wave season for this year were down compared to although it is not possible to identify the precise financial impact on us of each of the foregoing factors  these occurrences adversely impacted the travel and leisure industry in general  and the cruise and resort industries and us in particular 
similar occurrences in the future could also have such adverse impact 
we believe that a more stable international political climate as well as the absence of publicized mass illnesses affecting ships or resort venues has led to better results for the cruise line and resort industries and us in and weather also can impact our results  and did so in and the multiple hurricanes that hit the southern united states and other regions in the third quarters of each of these years caused cancellation or disruption of certain cruises and the closure of certain of our resort spas and campuses of our massage and beauty schools  which had adverse effects on us 
in addition  the strong tsunami that hit various asian regions in december resulted in damage to  and the closing of  most of our operations in the maldive islands during much of other factors also can adversely affect our financial results 
an increasing percentage of cruise passengers who use our services are repeat customers of ours 
these repeat customers are less likely to purchase our products than new customers 
in addition  there is an increasing demand for medi spa services dermatological and other medical type services by spa customers 
in order for us to meet this demand  we will be required to expend funds on new facilities and  if necessary  find appropriate third parties to assist us in providing these services 
in addition to these expenditures  these services could increase the risk of personal injury liability to us 
historically a significant portion of our operations has been conducted on ships through entities that are not subject to income taxation in the united states or other jurisdictions 
to the extent that our non shipboard income increases as a percentage of our overall revenues  the amount of our income that will be subject to tax would increase 
we develop and sell a variety of high quality beauty products under our elemis and la therapie brands 
we also sell products of third parties 
an increasing amount of revenues have come from our sales of products through third party retail outlets  our web sites  mail order and other channels 
we also offer post secondary degree and non degree programs in massage therapy  skin care and related areas at our school in florida  maryland  pennsylvania and virginia 
in and the first half of  the financial results of our schools were less than we had anticipated 
in january  we terminated operations at our campus in winchester  virginia 
key performance indicators cruise industry operations 
a measure of performance we have used in connection with our periodic financial disclosure relating to our cruise line operations is that of revenue per staff per day 
in using that measure we have differentiated between our revenue per staff per day on ships with large spas and other ships we serve 
our revenue per staff per day has been affected by the increasing requirements of cruise lines that we place additional non revenue producing staff on ships with large spas to help maintain a high quality guest experience 
we also utilize  as measures of performance for our cruise line operations  our average revenue per week and our revenue per passenger per day 
we use these measures of performance because they assist us in determining the productivity of our staff  which we believe is a critical element of our operations 
resort spas 
with respect to our resort spas we measure our performance primarily through average weekly revenue over applicable periods of time 
schools 
with respect to our massage and beauty schools  we measure performance primarily by the number of new student enrollments and the rate of retention of our students 
a new student enrollment occurs each time a new student commences classes at one of our schools 
products 
with respect to sales of our products  other than on cruise ships and at our resort and day spas  we measure performance by revenues 
growth we seek to grow our business by attempting to obtain contracts for new cruise ships brought into service by our existing cruise line customers and other cruise lines  seeking new venues for our resort spas  developing new products and services  seeking additional channels for the distribution of our retail products and seeking to increase the student enrollments at our post secondary massage and beauty schools 
we also consider growth  among other things  through appropriate strategic transactions  including acquisitions and joint ventures 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
this discussion is not intended to be a comprehensive description of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact on our business operations and any associated risks related to these policies is discussed under results of operations  below  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  please see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f note that our preparation of this form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
cost of revenues includes cost of services  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees and wages paid directly to land based spa employees  payments to cruise lines and land based spa venue owners and other staff related shipboard expenses  spa facilities depreciation  as well as  with respect to our schools  directly attributable campus costs such as rent and employee wages  and cost of products  including an allocable portion of wages paid to shipboard employees  payments to cruise lines and land based spa venue owners and other staff related shipboard expenses  as well as costs associated with development  manufacturing and distribution of products 
cost of revenues may be affected by  among other things  sales mix  production levels  exchange rates  changes in supplier prices and discounts  purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies  tariffs  duties  freight and inventory costs 
certain cruise line agreements provide for increases in the percentages of services and products revenues and or  as the case may be  the amount of minimum annual commissions payable over the terms of those agreements 
these payments may also be increased under new agreements with cruise lines and resort spa and day spa venue owners that replace expiring agreements 
cost of products includes the cost of products sold through our various methods of distribution 
to a lesser extent  cost of products also includes the cost of products consumed in rendering services 
this amount is not a material component of the cost of services rendered and would not be practicable to identify separately 
operating expenses include administrative expenses  salary and payroll taxes 
in addition  operating expenses include amortization of intangibles relating to our acquisitions of resort spas in property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets in question 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
for certain properties  leasehold improvements are amortized over lease terms  which include renewal periods that may be obtained at our option and that are considered significant to the continuation of our operations and to the existence of leasehold improvements  the value of which would be impaired by our discontinuing use of the leased property 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset  industry practice and asset maintenance policies 
maintenance and repa ir items are expensed as incurred 
goodwill pursuant to sfas  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
as of december   we had unamortized goodwill and intangibles of million 
in january  we performed the required annual impairment test and determined there was no impairment 
the annual assessment for impairment for our schools segment as of january  indicated that no impairment was present 
the determination of fair value used in that assessment is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the component 
goodwill in our schools segment was million as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment statement r  which will require us to recognize compensation costs in our financial statements in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments granted to employees and directors 
in april  the sec approved a new rule that delayed the effective date of sfas r until the first quarter of we adopted sfas r on january  for previously issued awards  we will adopt sfas r on a modified prospective basis and recognize compensation expense on the unvested portion of the awards over the remaining vesting period 
sfas r is expected to reduce our results of operations by approximately million for the year ended december  based on the black scholes model

revenues increased approximately  or million  to million in from million in of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in services revenues and million was attributable to an increase in products revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an average of eight additional large spa ships in service in compared to additionally  during we operated spa facilities at the one only palmilla  a resort in los cabos  mexico and at the westin rio mar beach resort in puerto rico

the income from discontinued operations increased million from income of million in to income of million in this increase was primarily attributable to a reversal of  of gift certificate liability determined based on an aging and redemption analysis that deemed the likelihood of future redemption of the certificates in question to be remote 
compared to revenues 
revenues increased approximately  or million  to million in from million in of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in services revenues and million was attributable to an increase in products revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an improving leisure industry in as compared to  during which the hostilities in iraq and the sars illness had a more significant adverse effect on the leisure industry and our business 
the increase in revenues also was attributable to an average of eight additional large spa ships in service in compared to these positive developments were partially offset by the cancellation or disruption of certain cruises and the closure of certain resort spas and campuses of our massage and beauty schools as a result of a very active hurricane season

provision for income taxes increased million from expense of million in to expense of million in the provision for income taxes increased to an overall effective rate of for from an overall effective rate of for  primarily due to the income earned in jurisdictions that tax our income representing a greater percentage of the total income earned in than such income represented in income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax

quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data on a quarterly basis for and and the percentage of revenues represented by the line items presented 
we have experienced varying degrees of seasonality  due to the seasonality experienced by certain cruise lines  resulting in the third quarter being the strongest quarter for us 
the quarterly selected statements of operations data set forth below were derived from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of steiner leisure and excludes the day spa segment  which is reported in discontinued operations which  in the opinion of our management  contain all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of those statements 
fiscal year fiscal year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands  except per share data statement of operations data revenues gross profit administrative  salary and payroll taxes income from continuing operations discontinued operations net income basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share as a percentage of revenues gross profit administrative  salary and payroll taxes income from continuing operations discontinued operations net income liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net income and changes in working capital items 
during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities was million compared with million for the year ended december  in  we incurred costs of approximately million to fund the build out of a luxury spa at the dolphin and swan hotel near orlando  florida  which opened in september additionally  during the year  we incurred costs of approximately million to fund the build outs of various other spas 
in  the capital expenditures were offset by the receipt of million related to the sale of our ownership interest in each of two entities that operate spas in thailand and china to the owner thereof 
during the year ended december   cash used in financing activities was million  compared with million for the year ended december  included in the amount is cash used to purchase approximately million of our shares 
those payments were offset by the receipt of million  representing the exercise price of common share options exercised during we had working capital of approximately million at december   compared to working capital of approximately million at december  in january  we entered into an agreement to fund the build out of  and operate  a luxury spa at the dolphin and swan hotels near orlando  florida 
the build out cost approximately million 
this luxury spa opened in september we funded this build out from working capital 
in august  we entered into an agreement to fund part of the build out of  and operate  a luxury spa at the loews miami beach hotel in florida 
we estimate that our share of the build out will be approximately million and we anticipate that this luxury spa will open in january we anticipate funding this build out from working capital 
in september  we entered into an agreement to fund part of the build out of  and operate  a luxury spa at the grand californian hotel in anaheim  california 
this luxury spa was completed in march our share of the build out cost was approximately million 
we funded this build out from working capital 
in addition  we recently entered into agreements relating to the operation and build out of three other luxury spas 
these build outs will cost an aggregate of approximately million 
these spas will open at various times during we anticipate funding these build outs from working capital 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to dispose of  or otherwise close  of the day spas we then operated due to their under performance 
the remaining day spa is located at a hotel and now operates as part of our resort spa operations 
as of april   all of those day spas had been closed or otherwise disposed of pursuant to agreements with landlords and or  in some cases  agreements with third party acquirers of the spas assets  including the leases 
some of these transactions involved our paying to those landlords amounts representing various portions of the remaining terms of the leases involved 
in the transactions involving transfers of spa assets and assignments of the leases  we typically were required to make payments to those acquirers in consideration of their assuming both the lease in question and certain gift certificate liabilities related to the spas in question 
the lease assignments to third parties generally do not include a release from the land lords of the spas in question and  accordingly  to the extent that these third parties fail to pay rent under the leases  we remain liable for that rent 
we would  in those instances  have a cause of action for such rental amounts against those third parties 
we remain liable for approximately million as of december  under these assigned leases to the extent the assignees fail to make their rental payments 
our loss on disposal in connection with these discontinued operations was approximately million in  and  in  we had a gain on disposal of approximately  our loss on operations in connection with these discontinued operations is approximately  million in and  for in  we had income from discontinued operations of  in addition  in connection with these discontinued operations  a former executive of that subsidiary terminated her employment with us 
in connection with that termination  ms 
dunn received a severance payment of  and options to purchase  of our common shares during the second quarter of we purchased a total of  of our common shares from february through may under our previously adopted share repurchase plan 
in june  our board authorized the purchase of an additional  shares 
during  we purchased  shares for a total of approximately million 
all of these purchases were funded from our working capital 
we cannot provide assurance as to the exact number of additional shares  if any  that will be purchased under our share repurchase plan 
in january  we entered into an agreement to purchase the assets of ucmt  which operates a post secondary massage therapy school with a total of seven campuses in utah  nevada  arizona and colorado 
those schools offer massage similar programs to those offered by the massage and beauty schools we currently operate 
in connection with the agreement to acquire ucmt  we entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of a small affiliate of ucmt that offers spa products  equipment and services to ucmt students and others 
the purchase price for the assets of ucmt is million in cash 
in addition  the seller can earn an additional million in cash if the net income of the ucmt schools meets a specified target for closing of the transaction is subject to conditions similar to those and other transactions of this type including  among others  the receipt of regulatory approval from the department of education the ucmt schools  like the schools we currently operate  are e ligible to receive title iv student loan funding and that an audit performed after december  reflects that those schools achieved specified targeted financial results in prior to closing  we will determine the extent to which the purchase price will be paid from existing cash and or through borrowings under our credit facility 
financing activities in july  we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provided for a term loan of million and a revolving credit facility of up to million 
borrowings under the term loan were used to fund our spa acquisitions and borrowings under the revolving credit facility have been used for working capital needs 
we repaid all outstanding amounts due under our former term loan and the revolving credit facility in on june   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with one of the banks in the original syndicate 
the terms and conditions of the new agreement are substantially the same as the former agreement except that there is no term loan component and the aggregate amount available for borrowing under the revolving line of credit was increased from million to million and the maturity date of the revolving facility was extended two years to july  borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substant ially all of our assets and bear interest primarily at london interbank offered rate libor based rates plus a spread that is dependent upon our financial performance 
as of december   there was million available under the revolving facility 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative  negative and financial covenants  including limitations on dividends  capital expenditures and funded debt  and requirements to maintain prescribed interest expense and fixed charge coverage ratios 
as of december  and february   we were in compliance with these covenants 
other limitations on capital expenditures  or on other operational matters  could apply in the future under the credit agreement 
the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations minimum cruise line commissions operating leases employment agreements spa build outs total these amounts represent guaranteed minimum payments pursuant to cruise line agreements 
included herein are the minimum guaranteed payment obligations under certain of our resort spa leases 
we believe that cash generated from operations is sufficient to satisfy the cash required to operate our current business for the next months 
to the extent there is a significant slow down in travel resulting from terrorist attacks  such as those in london in july and bali in october  continued hostilities in iraq or other hostilities  or any other activities or conditions that adversely affect our business  cash generated from operations may not satisfy the cash required to operate our business 
in that case we may need additional financing which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation and economic conditions we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on revenues or results of operations 
however  public demand for activities  including cruises  is influenced by general economic conditions  including inflation 
periods of economic recession or high inflation  particularly in north america where a substantial number of cruise passengers reside  could have a material adverse effect on the cruise industry upon which we are dependent 
a recurrence of the softness of the economy in north america that occurred in recent years and over capacity in the cruise industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had a revolving line of credit in place  though we had no outstanding borrowings under that credit facility or otherwise 
to the extent we have outstanding borrowings from time to time  steiner leisure s major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate derivatives based upon market conditions 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we have used interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes to its borrowings 
these swaps are typically entered into with a group of financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby reducing the risk of credit loss 
while our revenues and expenses are primarily represented by us dollars  they also are represented by various other currencies  primarily the british pound sterling 
accordingly  we face the risk of fluctuations in non us currencies compared to us dollars 
we manage this currency risk by monitoring fluctuations in foreign currencies and  when exchange rates are appropriate  purchasing amounts of those foreign currencies 
a hypothetical strengthening in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling to the united states dollar as of december  would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
