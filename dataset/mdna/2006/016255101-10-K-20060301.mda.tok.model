given these risks and uncertainties  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
part i item business our company align technology  inc was incorporated in april under the laws of the state of delaware 
we design  manufacture and market the invisalign system  a proprietary method for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear  nearly invisible  removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position 
because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires  invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces 
invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition 
align technology received fda clearance to market invisalign in under the corporate information investor relations section of our corporate website which can be accessed at either www

industry background malocclusion malocclusion  the misalignment of teeth  is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions  affecting over million individuals  or approximately of the us population 
approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance  malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay  tooth loss  gum disease  jaw joint pain and headaches 
because of the compromised aesthetics  discomfort and other drawbacks associated with conventional orthodontic treatments  only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek traditional treatment 
traditional orthodontic treatment in the us  dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal archwires and brackets  commonly referred to as braces 
occasionally  dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic  tooth colored brackets or bond brackets on the inside  or lingual surfaces  of the patient s teeth 
dental professionals also augment braces with elastics  metal bands  headgear and other ancillary devices 
the average treatment takes approximately to months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement  or chair time 
to initiate treatment  a dental professional will diagnose a patient s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan 
in a subsequent visit  the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient s teeth with cement and attach an archwire to the brackets 
thereafter  by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks  the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement 
because of the length of time between visits  the dental professional must tighten the braces to a degree sufficient to achieve sustained tooth movement during the interval 
in a final visit  the dental professional removes each bracket and residual cement from the patient s teeth 
fees for traditional orthodontic treatment typically range between us  to  with a median fee of approximately  generally only a portion of the fees are reimbursed by insurance  if covered at all 
in addition  dental professionals commonly charge a premium for lingual or ceramic alternatives 
fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional s estimate of chair time  and are generally negotiated in advance 
a treatment that exceeds the dental professional s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time  or reduced profitability for the dental professional 
limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions  they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages 
conventional orthodontic treatment is associated with unattractive appearance 
braces call attention to the patient s condition and treatment 
in addition  braces trap food  which can further compromise appearance 
braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth 
many adults associate braces with adolescence 
as a result of these and other limitations  less than one percent of american adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment annually 
oral discomfort 
braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth 
the tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort  especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit 
poor oral hygiene 
braces compromise oral hygiene by making it more difficult to brush and floss 
these problems can result in tooth decay and periodontal damage 
additionally  the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth 
inability to project treatment 
historically  dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment 
accordingly  dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment 
as a result  they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits 
this lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professional s ability to estimate the duration of treatment 
because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis  extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental professional 
physical demands on dental professional 
the manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity  and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional 
root resorption 
the sustained high levels of force associated with conventional treatment can result in root resorption  which is a shortening of tooth roots 
this shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient 
emergencies 
at times  braces need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis 
such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional 
due to the poor aesthetics  discomfort and other limitations of braces  relatively few people with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment 
accordingly  we believe there is a large unmet need for an orthodontic system that addresses these patient concerns 
we also believe there is an unmet need among dental professionals for a treatment system that increases the predictability and efficiency of treatment and enhances practice profitability 
the align solution invisalign which includes full invisalign treatment and invisalign express discussed below under our products is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion 
the invisalign treatment process is comprised of several phases  the principal steps of which are the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck and the manufacturing of invisalign aligners referred to in this form k as aligners 
the complete invisalign treatment process is described in greater detail under business the invisalign treatment process 
clincheck 
clincheck is an internally developed computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients 
we use a dental impression and a treatment form submitted by a dental professional to develop a customized  three dimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two week increments 
clincheck allows the dental professional to view this three dimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle 
accordingly  clincheck enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible 
upon review of the clincheck simulation  the dental professional may immediately approve the projected treatment  or may provide us with feedback for modification 
we reflect any requested adjustments in a modified simulation 
upon the dental professional s approval of the clincheck simulation  we use the data underlying the simulation  in conjunction with stereolithography technology  to manufacture aligner molds 
a third party shelter services provider in juarez  mexico uses these molds to fabricate the patient s aligners 
aligners 
aligners are custom manufactured  thin  clear plastic  removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two week stage of the clincheck simulation 
aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck 
each aligner covers a patient s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn 
aligners are commonly worn in pairs  over the upper and lower dental arches 
aligners are generally worn for consecutive two week periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment simulation 
after two weeks of use  the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series 
this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete 
upon completion of the treatment  the dental professional may  at his or her discretion  have the patient use an invisalign retainer or go directly to a conventional retainer 
our products the vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of full invisalign treatment and invisalign express treatment 
approximately of our revenue is generated by the sale of training and the sale of ancillary products 
full invisalign treatment 
commercial sales of full invisalign treatment commenced in the us in july our traditional  full invisalign treatment option is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions 
each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and the treatment plan will consist of as many aligners as is necessary to achieve the doctor s treatment goals 
invisalign express 
in the third quarter of  we launched invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex orthodontic cases 
invisalign express is a dual arch orthodontic treatment consisting of up to ten aligners 
invisalign express is intended to help a broader range of patients elect orthodontic treatment by providing a lower cost option for adult relapse cases  for minor crowding and spacing  and as a pre cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatment such as veneers 
benefits of invisalign we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to conventional braces 
benefits to the dental professional ability to visualize treatment and likely outcomes 
clincheck enables dental professionals to preview a course of treatment and the likely outcome of treatment in an interactive three dimensional computer model 
clincheck allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient 
begin using invisalign with minimal additional training 
the biomechanical principles that underlie treatment with the invisalign system are consistent with those of traditional orthodontics 
dental professionals can complete our initial training within two days 
we provide additional clinical support following the initial training and encourage dental professionals to attend continuing education classes  seminars and workshops 
expanded patient base 
we believe that invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics 
currently  approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us these patients represent approximately percent of the population of people with malocclusion 
of these  we estimate approximately percent  or approximately  patients have mature dentition with mild to moderate malocclusion and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign 
we believe that invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment 
decreased dental professional and staff time 
invisalign eliminates the need for time intensive processes such as bonding appliances to the patient s teeth  adjusting archwires during the course of treatment and removing the appliances at the conclusion of treatment 
as such  use of invisalign reduces dental professional and staff chair time and can increase practice throughput 
practice productivity 
we believe that as dental professionals move to a higher volume of invisalign patients  they will be able to better leverage their existing resources  including office space and staff time  resulting in an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity 
benefits to the patient excellent aesthetics 
aligners are nearly invisible when worn  significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with conventional braces 
comfort 
by replacing the six week adjustment cycle of traditional braces with two week stages  aligners move teeth more gently than conventional braces 
also  aligners are thin  smooth and low in profile 
as a result  aligners are substantially more comfortable and less abrasive than conventional braces 
improved oral hygiene 
patients can remove aligners for tasks that are difficult with conventional braces  such as eating  brushing and flossing 
we believe this feature has the potential to reduce tooth decay and periodontal damage during treatment  which may result from conventional braces 
potentially reduced overall treatment time 
aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth 
in addition  the clincheck simulation from which aligners are produced is designed to reduce unintended and unnecessary tooth movements 
together  these factors may reduce overall treatment time relative to conventional braces 
potentially reduced root resorption 
we believe that controlling force and shortening treatment time has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption  which is the breakdown or destruction of root structure 
reduced incidence of emergencies 
typically  a lost or broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in the treatment series  minimizing inconvenience to both patient and dental professional 
we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of conventional braces 
limitations of invisalign in some instances  the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to conventional treatment 
aligners cost more to produce than conventional braces  and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in conventional treatment 
depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional  the cost of full invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for conventional braces 
dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan 
once a dental professional submits a case to us  there is generally a turn around time of a month or more before the corresponding aligners are delivered 
aligners may not be appropriate for all cases  such as severe malocclusion  which may require aligners to be used in combination with conventional braces for optimal results 
in addition  because aligners are removable  treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended 
some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech 
in some instances  patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums  cheeks and lips and in some rare instances allergic reactions have occurred 
we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 
our target market and patient base medical devices are classified into one of three classes based on the controls necessary to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness 
class i or ii devices require the manufacturer to submit a pre market notification to the food and drug administration  or the fda  requesting permission for commercial distribution  which is known as k clearance 
we obtained our k clearance in september our k clearance allows us to market invisalign to treat patients with any type of malocclusion provided that the patient has mature dentition 
we currently restrict the use of invisalign to adults and teens with mature dentition 
individuals with mature dentition have fully erupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth  which typically occurs between the ages of and years 
we do not treat children whose teeth and jaws are still developing  as the effectiveness of invisalign relies on our ability to accurately predict the movement of teeth over the course of treatment 
based on our clinical studies to date  we recommend that dental professionals use invisalign as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions and as a component of treatment for severe malocclusions 
approximately two million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists in the us these patients represent approximately one percent of the population of people with malocclusion 
of these  we estimate percent  or more than  patients  have mature dentition and are therefore potential candidates for invisalign 
our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations 
we believe that  since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces  persons with malocclusion will be more likely to seek treatment 
we believe that adults  who are particularly sensitive to the aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment  represent our most immediate and significant market expansion opportunity 
in an effort to more fully penetrate our target market  in august  we launched invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex cases 
invisalign express is a simple  dual arch orthodontic treatment consisting of up to ten aligners 
we expect invisalign express will increase the overall market for invisalign  as patients who would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment due to its relatively high cost are introduced to this lower cost treatment option 
we continue to market and sell our traditional full invisalign treatment option for more complex cases 
as of december   approximately  patients worldwide have started treatment using invisalign 
internationally  we operate in the geographic regions of europe  asia pacific  japan and latin america 
in  international sales accounted for of our net revenues 
in each of fiscal  and  no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenues 
business strategy our objective is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating orthodontic malocclusion through customer responsiveness  product leadership and operational effectiveness 
key elements of our strategy include the following 
customer responsiveness focus on education and customer support 
in order to build long term relationships with our customers  we focus on delivering superior training  support and services 
each year  we provide numerous clinical education and training programs  which include certification classes  conference calls  seminars and workshops 
by participating in these events  we believe that our customers will emerge with a better understanding of the product and its applicability  and with a greater awareness for starting and finishing invisalign cases 
we also maintain an online clinical education center which is intended to augment our training workshops  conference calls and seminars by enabling invisalign trained doctors to obtain continuing education credits and access a full range of case studies and best practices 
educate future orthodontists and general practitioners 
by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique  we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option 
currently  we have incorporated the invisalign technique into selected orthodontic and dental undergraduate curriculums 
in  we intend to continue the integration of invisalign into the programs of additional universities and post graduate institutions 
stimulate demand for invisalign treatment 
our market research indicates that the vast majority of people with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations  such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort 
by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers  we intend to increase the number of patients who seek orthodontic treatment annually 
in the second quarter of  we launched a new consumer marketing campaign designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced dental professionals 
as of december   we had trained approximately  dental professionals worldwide on the use and benefits of invisalign 
improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps 
we have two customer channels the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist  or gp 
although we have historically generated a majority of our revenues from orthodontists  there exists a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists 
as the primary care dental provider  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists  and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign 
gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and  in certain instances  may choose to treat less complex cases themselves 
we are committed to improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gps 
we continue to support study clubs  which pair experienced orthodontists with less experienced gps 
these orthodontists act as mentors to the gps and lend them support and guidance in their invisalign practice 
through these study clubs  gps are introduced to an experienced invisalign practitioner and are able to refer appropriate cases to these orthodontists 
we believe that improved collaboration is beneficial to the orthodontist and the gp and will accelerate growth in invisalign cases and consequently increase our revenues 
as specialists  orthodontists are a critical part of our business  and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications 
we expect  however  that that the percentage of revenue generated by gps will increase  largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists 
we believe the expected increase in the number of cases treated by gps will result in an increase in the overall market for invisalign as patients that would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by gps 
information regarding risks related to our expectation that orthodontists and gps will collaborate may be found in part i  item a of this report on form k under the heading risk factors 
product leadership new products and enhancements to products 
our strategy for ensuring product leadership focuses on delivering new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience 
in we launched invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex cases  allowing the dental professional to treat a broader range of patients 
currently we are in early testing of a bracket positioning template or bpt 
the bpt product  which is intended to be used in conjunction with our digital treatment plan  will  if successfully launched  allow dental professionals to place traditional brackets on teeth with minimal effort  thereby increasing their efficiency and reducing patient chair time 
new product features and enhancements include the compliance indicator  aligner branding and next generation aligner material 
the compliance indicator will help the dental professional and the patient understand if the patient has worn their aligner for enough time to effectively move their teeth 
aligner branding is intended to distinguish and grow the invisalign brand  differentiating us from our competitors 
next generation aligner material will more consistently deliver force to the teeth over a longer period of time  improving efficacy of treatment 
we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features as well as enhancing the user experience will keep us at the forefront of the market 
extend and defend technology leadership 
invisalign represents a significant technological advancement in orthodontics 
our issued us patents broadly cover the invisalign system  including digital modeling and manipulation of scanned patient data  treatment planning  and fabrication of dental appliances  among others 
we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and non disclosure agreements 
we also seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
nonetheless  our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of various countries where the invisalign system is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
information regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in part i  item a of this report on form k under the heading risk factors 
see also part i  item of this report on form k under the heading legal proceedings 
operational effectiveness expand and enhance manufacturing capability 
our manufacturing operations are designed to produce large numbers of custom aligners at a high level of quality 
to improve cost efficiency  we conduct labor intensive processes in relatively low wage countries 
we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet current requirements and that additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate any expansion of operations 
our proprietary software underlies our manufacturing process 
by continually developing this software and other manufacturing processes  we plan to increase the level of production automation 
increased automation will enhance production capacity and reduce both production times and unit costs 
manufacturing we produce highly customized  precise  medical quality products in volume 
to do so  we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies 
these technologies include complex software solutions  computed tomography  known as ct scanning  stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication 
we rely on two vendors who are each the sole source of the polymer and resin used in our manufacturing process 
in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products  we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 
as of december   we employed a manufacturing staff in the us and costa rica of approximately people 
manufacturing is coordinated in santa clara  california 
digital dental modeling is processed in our  square foot facility in san jose  costa rica 
the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatments using simulation software 
in the second quarter of  in an effort to optimize operations  improve efficiency and reduce operating costs  we announced our intention to relocate our streolithography sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara  california facility and outsource this process to a third party shelter services provider based in juarez  mexico 
we expect this relocation to be complete by the second quarter of we also outsource the fabrication and packaging of aligners to this same third party shelter services provider 
information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found in part i  item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
the invisalign treatment process the invisalign treatment process comprises the following five stages orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us 
in an initial patient visit  the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment 
the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of a polyvinyl siloxane  or pvs  impression of the relevant dental arches  x rays of the patient s dentition  photographs of the patient  a bite impression depicting the relationship between the patient s upper and lower dental arches and an invisalign treatment planning form  or prescription 
the impression is a critical component of invisalign as it depicts the three dimensional geometry of the patient s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models 
an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material 
this material hardens  capturing the shape of the patient s teeth 
the prescription is also a critical component of invisalign  describing the desired positions and movement of the patient s teeth 
the dental professional sends the treatment data to our santa clara facility 
preparation of three dimensional computer models of the patient s initial malocclusion 
upon receipt  we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient s dentition 
using ct scanning  we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital  three dimensional computer model of the patient s current dentition 
we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facilities in costa rica 
preparation of computer simulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck 
in costa rica we transform this initial digital model into a customized  three dimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two week increments 
this simulation is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical  treatment and quality standards 
upon passing review  the simulation is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via virtual invisalign practice vip  our proprietary customer interfacing software  which is available on our websites located at www 
invisalign 
com and www 
aligntech 
com 
the dental professional then reviews the clincheck simulation and determines whether to ask us to make adjustments 
by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation  the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and  thus  participates in the customized design of the aligners 
at this point  the dental professional may also invite the patient to review clincheck  allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment 
the dental professional then approves the proposed treatment and  in doing so  engages us for the manufacture of corresponding aligners 
construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment 
we use the approved clincheck simulation to construct a series of molds of the patient s teeth 
each mold is a replica of the patient s teeth at each two week stage of the simulated course of treatment 
these molds are currently fabricated at our santa clara  california manufacturing facility using stereolithography that we have adapted for use in orthodontic applications 
as noted above  we intend to relocate our sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara  california facility and outsource this process to a third party shelter services provider based in juarez  mexico 
we expect this relocation to be complete by the second quarter of manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional 
from these molds  our third party shelter services provider in juarez  mexico fabricates aligners by pressure forming polymeric sheets over each mold 
the aligners are then trimmed  polished  cleaned and packaged 
following final inspection  the aligners are shipped directly to the prescribing dental professional 
we ship all of the aligners in a single batch 
in certain cases  dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with tooth colored attachments bonded to the patient s teeth 
these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement 
in certain cases  we provide an aligner like template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient s teeth 
also  in cases where interproximal reduction  or ipr  is requested by the dental professional  we provide an ipr treatment form  quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction  location  and timing of ipr 
throughput management because we manufacture each case on a build to order basis  we do not build inventories 
as a result  we must conservatively build manufacturing throughput for anticipated demand 
to increase throughput  we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 
in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes  we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of rate limiting processes  or bottlenecks 
we continue to upgrade our proprietary  three dimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case  thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica 
we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez  mexico 
in order to scale our manufacturing capacity  we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment including the purchase of additional sla machines during quality assurance align s quality system is in compliance with food drug administration s medical device regulations  cfr part  and health canada s medical device regulations 
we are certified to en iso  internationally recognized standards for medical device manufacturing and iso  recognized standards of the council of canada 
align has a formal  documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined  understood and achieved 
systems  processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality 
we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes  taking corrective action  as needed 
since we custom manufacture aligners on a build to order basis  we do not offer refunds on our products 
because each clincheck and each aligner is unique  we inspect of the product at various points in the manufacturing process  to ensure that the product meets our customers expectations 
aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty  which covers defects in materials and workmanship 
our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed 
in the event the aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty  we will replace the aligners at our expense 
our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended 
if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners  and as a result  requests additional invisalign treatment  the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners 
the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign 
actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan 
deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors  such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth 
sales and marketing we market invisalign by communicating invisalign s benefits directly to dental professionals through our training  certification programs and direct mail campaigns and to consumers with a nationwide advertising campaign 
based on our experience with advertising and commercial sales in our test markets  we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a new treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign 
in order to serve anticipated demand  we are training a broad base of dental professionals 
professional marketing our sales and support staff has been engaged in marketing invisalign to orthodontists since july in  we began marketing invisalign to general practitioner dentists in our domestic market 
we provide training  certification  marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and general practitioner dentists in the us and canada  which we consider our domestic market  and internationally 
as of december   we had trained approximately  dental professionals worldwide to use invisalign 
of those trained dental professionals  approximately are dental professionals in our domestic market united states and canada 
within our domestic market  we have trained approximately  orthodontists and approximately  active general practitioner dentists 
invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment 
our sales and orthodontic teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format 
the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability  instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form  clinical tips and techniques  guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of our website 
after training  sales representatives follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases 
such follow up may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions  establishing an internet connection and familiarizing them with our website 
sales representatives may also provide practice building assistance  including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media 
many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 
consumer marketing our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from six primary sources an orthodontist  a general practice dentist  consumer marketing and advertising  our website  which can be accessed at either www 
invisalign 
com or www 
aligntech 
com 
direct to consumer mail advertising and public relations efforts  and other invisalign patients 
in the second quarter of  we launched a new consumer marketing campaign and advertising strategy involving television  radio  print media and consumer website 
this marketing program is designed to raise the profile of invisalign and drive more consumers to our most experienced dental professionals 
research and development our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of dental applicability of invisalign  enhancing the software used in the manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign system product lines 
our research and development expenses were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal in an effort to demonstrate invisalign s broad treatment capabilities  a series of clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases  including those of severe complexity 
we are also undertaking post marketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 
our product development team is testing enhanced materials and a number of complementary products  such as the bracket positioning template that when used in conjunction with our digital treatment plan  will  if successfully launched  guide doctors in proper bracket placement in traditional wires and brackets therapy and the compliance indicator  which will help doctors and patients understand if the patients have worn their aligners for enough time to effectively move their teeth 
intellectual property we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications  and numerous foreign issued patents  as well as pending foreign patent applications 
see part i  item legal proceedings for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 
we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and non disclosure agreements 
we also seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products 
our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 
information regarding risks associated with failure to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in part i  item a of this report on form k under the heading risk factors 
competition we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets  which include m company  sybron dental specialties and dentsply international  inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign  including the product called red  white blue manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics  a wholly owned subsidiary of sybron dental specialties 
see part i  item legal proceedings for a summary of our litigation with ormco and the permanent injunction issued by the court to enjoin ormco from selling the infringing red  white blue 
in may  orthoclear  inc announced the commercial launch of the orthoclear system  a product that is intended to compete directly with our invisalign system 
we believe that orthoclear s product infringes on our intellectual property  including our trade secrets 
see part i  item legal proceedings for a summary of our litigation with orthoclear 
in the future  we may face further competition from other early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign 
information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in part i  item ia of this report on form k under the heading risk factors 
we believe that in addition to price  the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following aesthetic appeal of the treatment method  effectiveness of treatment  customer support  comfort associated with the treatment method  oral hygiene  ease of use  and dental professionals chair time 
we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors products with respect to each of these factors 
government regulation fda s quality system regulation for medical devices 
invisalign has recently been informed by the food and drug administration  or fda that our invisalign system has been classified as a class ii medical device  correcting what the fda described as a prior classification error 
the invisalign system was previously regulated as a class i medical device and was exempted from requiring k pre market notification prior to commercialization 
in  however  we voluntarily filed with and subsequently received pre market clearance from the fda pursuant to the k premarket notification procedure  allowing us to market the product in the us therefore  we currently possess the necessary k clearance from the fda to continue to market our product under the class ii classification 
prior to this classification correction  our product development  manufacturing processes  packaging  labeling  handling  storage and distribution activities were subject to extensive oversight by the fda 
we believe our invisalign system is in compliance in all material respects with applicable quality system regulations  record keeping and reporting requirements in the production and distribution of the invisalign system 
we do not anticipate any significant difficulty or material cost increases in complying with applicable performance standards as a result of the incremental regulatory requirements resulting from the class ii classification 
our aligners are manufactured by international manufacturing solutions operaciones  srl ims  a third party shelter services provider based in juarez  mexico 
ims is registered with the fda as a medical device manufacturer and is certified to iso requirements 
we have also ensured that our quality system procedures and processes have been implemented at ims to comply with the fda s quality systems standards 
ims has dedicated an area in its facilities and trained personnel in the manufacture and distribution of invisalign 
we and ims are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements 
we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer 
if the fda determines that we or ims failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations  it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions  including but not limited to financial penalties  withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 
health canada s medical device regulations 
in canada  we are required to comply with health canada s medical device regulations 
our products are registered with health canada 
we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada 
european union s mdd requirements iso in europe  invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such  we follow the requirements of the medical device directives 
we are iso certified  which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe 
health insurance portability and accountability act of under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health information 
confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  referred to as the privacy standard  and other state laws and regulations 
the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information 
although compliance is principally the responsibility of the hospital  physician or other healthcare provider  we are required to maintain the confidentiality of patient information when providing technical services and when handling patient information and records 
we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations 
maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provided services to our customers 
additionally  our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements 
other federal and state laws 
as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
furthermore  our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects 
for example  the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us  released for inclusion in our databases  or released by us to third parties  are subject to substantial regulation by state governments 
these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly 
in addition  provisions under the federal anti kickback statute prohibit  among other things  paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in  or for the order  purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by  medicare  medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs 
most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws 
these laws are applicable to our financial relationships with  and any marketing or other promotional activities involving  our dental professional customers 
finally  various states regulate the operation of an advertising and referral service for dentists  and may require registration of such services with a state agency as well as compliance with various requirements and restrictions on how they conduct business and structure their relationships with participating dentists 
violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions

risk factors if we fail to sustain our revenue growth while controlling our expenses  the market price of our common stock may decline 
you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by a company in an early stage of operations 
consistent with a company in an early stage of operations  we continue to incur significant operating expenses to develop new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing processes  execute our consumer marketing campaign and dental professional marketing efforts  execute clinical research and education plans  develop technological improvements to our products and new product development  continue our international sales and marketing efforts  protect our intellectual property  including trade secrets  and undertake quality assurance and improvement initiatives 
for instance  in an effort to raise the profile of invisalign and drive prospective patients to our most experienced dental professionals  in the second quarter of  we launched a consumer marketing campaign involving television  radio and print media 
marketing programs of this nature are expensive and may have limited success  if any  and may not result in revenue generation commensurate with its costs 
while we achieved profitability beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced a net loss in the third quarter of if we are to achieve profitability in future periods  we will need to continue to increase our revenues  while controlling our expenses 
we generated positive operating cash flow for the first time in fiscal year and continued to generate positive operating cash flow in fiscal years and however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase such positive cash flow from operations  from period to period  in the future 
because our business is evolving  it is difficult to predict our future operating results or levels of growth  and we may not be able to sustain our historical growth rates in future periods 
if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
we have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock price 
we were incorporated in april and began sales of invisalign in july thus  we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
in addition  we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing our commercial sales 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors  such as orthoclear  inc  aggressive price competition from competitors  including orthoclear  changes in the timing of product orders  unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity  any disruptions in the manufacturing process  including as a result of unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes  inaccurate forecasting of revenues  production and other operating costs  costs and expenditures in connection with ongoing litigation  in particular the litigation related to orthoclear  changes in product mix due to the introduction of invisalign express  a lower cost alternative for treating less complex cases  and investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to invisalign 
to respond to these and other factors  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations  we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues 
therefore  our operating results for a given period may be adversely affected 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
we are currently involved in litigation with several former employees stemming from our efforts to protect our intellectual property 
this litigation is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 
we seek to diligently protect our intellectual property rights 
on february  we filed a complaint against orthoclear  inc  orthoclear holdings  inc  mr 
chishti  one of our founders  and several former employees 
among other things  the complaint alleges tort  contract  statutory and common law causes of action arising from orthoclear and the individual defendants alleged plan to unlawfully utilize our intellectual property  confidential information and employees 
the complaint also alleges that orthoclear  mr 
chishti  and other defendants are in breach of contractual obligations  statutory law and common law for attempting to intentionally interfere and disrupt our ongoing business operations and improperly gain access to our customer relationships and trade secrets 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages in an amount to be determined 
on july   we filed a multi claim lawsuit in the united states district court for the northern district of california against orthoclear 
the complaint alleges numerous violations of the federal lanham act usc et seq 
by orthoclear and its officers and employees 
these violations include unfair competition  trademark infringement and false advertising 
the complaint also alleges violations by orthoclear of california s unfair practices act california business and professions code et seq on january   we filed a complaint with the international trade commission itc against orthoclear  seeking to halt the importation into the united states of infringing aligners manufactured by orthoclear in pakistan in violation of our patents and other intellectual property rights 
the itc complaint requests the itc institute an immediate investigation and ultimately issue an exclusionary order  enforced by us customs and border protection  excluding orthoclear aligners from importation into the united states 
the itc complaint also requests the itc issue two cease and desist orders specifically preventing orthoclear from importing infringing aligners and from selling in the united states imported orthoclear aligners 
the itc has determined to institute a formal investigation 
in addition  on january   we filed a federal court patent infringement action in the western district of wisconsin madison 
this federal action seeks monetary damages and an injunction to augment the exclusionary relief available from the itc 
although each of these lawsuits is in the early stages  litigating claims of this type  whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us  is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 
any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
in addition  we are currently a party to various other legal proceedings and claims 
management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  in the ormco litigation  there is no assurance that the court s decision will not be overturned on appeal 
in addition  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or  in cases where injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products 
any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
see part i item of this form k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 
we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 
currently  our invisalign product competes directly against a product called red  white and blue  which is manufactured and distributed by ormco  a subsidiary of sybron dental specialties  and an aligner product manufactured by orthoclear  inc in addition  manufacturers of traditional braces  such as m company  sybron dental specialties and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may  in the future  attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours 
large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market 
furthermore  we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies 
we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors  our business could be harmed 
in may  orthoclear announced the launch of the orthoclear system  a product that is intended to compete directly with our invisalign system 
although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights and prevent orthoclear from continuing to market any product that infringes on our intellectual property  if orthoclear is successful in gaining broad market acceptance of its product  our business could be adversely affected 
see part i item of this report on form k for a more complete summary of the orthoclear litigation 
increased competition from orthoclear and other competitors has recently resulted in and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions  reduced gross margins  reduced profitability and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  volume growth  net profit and stock price 
for instance  in the fourth quarter of  in order to encourage continued use of our products  we extended our volume based discount program directed to all of our doctors 
in addition  in the second half of  we introduced invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex cases as well as a new pricing initiative which had the effect of reducing our average selling price per case 
these programs have adversely affected our revenues  gross margin and net profit 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our information technology systems are critical to our business 
system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations  which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems 
all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources 
as our business has grown in size and complexity  the growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our information technology systems 
to effectively manage this growth  we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems to more effectively manage our operations 
throughout we intend to add additional functionality into our business enterprise systems  which will more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications  such as customer facing and manufacturing tools 
system upgrades and enhancements require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources 
delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications  specifically clincheck and vip 
software applications frequently contain errors or defects  especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
in addition  we currently do not have adequate resiliency in our information technology systems 
the discovery of a defect or error in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences  among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation or increased service costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
further  in the fourth quarter of we began transitioning to a new information technology outsourcing provider 
we terminated this relationship in the first quarter of and are currently transitioning back to our original information technology outsourcing provider 
delays in transition and failure to migrate smoothly through this transition could cause business disruptions 
in addition  experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties  create system disruptions or cause shutdowns 
furthermore  sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture  including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 
the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems  viruses and bugs could be significant  and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations  sales and operating results 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec  we are required to furnish in our form k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective  the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  and  as a result  the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we depend on the sale of invisalign for the vast majority of our revenues  and any decline in sales of invisalign or average selling prices would adversely affect revenue  gross margin and net profits 
we expect that revenues from the sale of invisalign will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists  gps and consumers is critical to our future success 
if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services  if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate  if orthodontists and gps do not collaborate as we expect or if the average selling price of our product declines  our operating results would be harmed 
factors that could cause invisalign not to achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect  as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 
dental professionals may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 
our success depends upon increasing acceptance of invisalign by dental professionals 
invisalign requires orthodontists  gps and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways 
in addition  because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july and commercially available only since july  orthodontists and gps may be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available 
also  increasing adoption and cumulative use by orthodontists and gps will depend on factors such as the capability  safety  efficacy  ease of use  price  quality and reliability of our products  our ability to provide effective sales support  training and service and the availability of competing products  technologies and alternative treatments 
in the future  unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and  consequently  reduced acceptance by dental professionals 
in addition  increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice 
if invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and gp communities  our operating results will be harmed 
consumers may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 
in addition  our success depends upon the acceptance of invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental professionals as well as potential consumers to whom we are now actively marketing 
invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment  and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment 
in addition  consumers may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for invisalign  which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment 
we have generally received positive feedback from both orthodontists  gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion  but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients 
market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals  as well as other factors including effectiveness  safety  reliability  improved treatment  aesthetics  greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products 
furthermore  consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience 
adoption by consumers may also be affected by general macroeconomic conditions in north america and internationally  which fluctuate and could be affected by unstable global economic  political or other conditions 
the orthodontist and gps may choose not to collaborate and referrals between orthodontists and gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 
our success depends in part upon improving the collaboration and referral relationships between orthodontists and gp dentists 
as specialists  orthodontists are a critical part of our business  and we expect that orthodontists will continue to treat the majority of complex cases and continue to drive research for expanding invisalign applications 
we expect  however  that the percentage of revenues generated by gps will increase  largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists 
as the primary provider of dental care  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists  possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients and introduce them to invisalign  have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontist and  in certain instances  may chose to treat less complex cases themselves 
if this collaboration and increase in referrals does not occur or occurs more slowly than we anticipate  our operating results could be harmed 
declines in average selling prices of our products 
in response to challenges in our business  including increased competition  in the second half of  we reduced the list price of full invisalign cases and introduced invisalign express  a lower cost solution for less complex cases 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we expanded our volume based discount program to all doctors 
as a result of these programs  the blended average selling price for our products has declined 
we expect each of these programs  and other similar programs that we may introduce in the future  to adversely affect our revenue  gross margin and net profits 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval or clearance of  manufacture and market new products 
in the second half of  we launched invisalign express a low cost aligner system to be used for less complex cases 
we are in early testing of a bracket positioning template and other new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop  sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables  which include  among other things  price  safety  efficacy  reliability  marketing and sales efforts  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation  including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 
we are dependent on our international manufacturing operations  which exposes us to foreign operational  political and other risks that may harm our business 
currently  two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica  technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans  which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck and are used to manufacture aligner molds 
a third party shelter services provider in juarez  mexico fabricates aligners and ships the completed products to our customers 
we are currently in the process of relocating our sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara  california facility to this same third party provider 
we expect this relocation to be complete by the second quarter of as a result of this relocation  our reliance on our international manufacturing operations will continue to increase 
our costs associated with these operations are denominated in costa rican colons  mexican pesos and us dollars 
our increasing reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation  including difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally  as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations  difficulties in managing international operations  including our relationship with ims  our third party shelter services provider  import and export license requirements and restrictions  controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process  political  social and economic instability  acts of terrorism and acts of war  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product or material transportation delays or disruption  burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and potential adverse tax consequences 
if any of these risks materialize in the future  we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 
in addition to the risks set forth above  if we do not successfully coordinate the relocation and consolidation of our sla mold fabrication operations  we may be unable to produce sufficient volume of molds to meet customer demand  which would harm our results of operations 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology  and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be harmed 
our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products  both in the us and in other countries 
our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications  and numerous foreign issued patents  as well as pending foreign patent applications 
we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
however  our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents 
additionally  any patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable  circumvented  or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products 
during fiscal  requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto by a san francisco  california  law firm  acting on behalf of an unnamed party  requesting re examination of a number of our patents 
the uspto has granted the request to reexamine us patent nos 
     as of the date of this report on form k  the uspto issued initial office actions with regard to us patent nos 
 the patent   the patent and  the patent 
while the pending re examinations are in a preliminary stage and we are still evaluating all issues  we believe that the claims of the patents in re examination will be determined to be patentable as currently written or as may be amended during the re examination proceedings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will prevail  and the re examination proceedings could cause some or all of these patent claims to have a narrower scope of coverage or even to be invalidated  which would have an adverse affect on us 
see part i item of this form k for a summary of the uspto proceedings 
in addition  any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws 
we also rely on protection of our copyrights  trade secrets  know how and proprietary information 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information  and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur 
see part i item of this form k for a summary of the orthoclear litigation 
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents  copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
in particular  a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology  which could adversely affect our pricing and market share 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 
we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering  technology development  sales and marketing personnel and management teams 
the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit  train and retain additional qualified personnel  including orthodontists 
few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices  universities and other research institutions 
thus  we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business 
furthermore  we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim  our ability to grow our business will be severely limited 
extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry 
we have been sued for infringement of third party s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 
from time to time  we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights 
while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention  there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities 
an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  in which event  our business would be materially adversely affected 
see part i item of this form k for a summary of our material pending legal proceedings 
we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process  and if our access to these inputs is diminished  our business may be harmed 
we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process 
we rely on a third party shelter services provider located in juarez  mexico to fabricate aligners and to ship the completed product to customers 
in addition  by the second quarter of fiscal  we expect to complete the relocation of our sla mold fabrication process to the same third party shelter services provider in juarez  mexico 
as a result  if this third party fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services  we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner  and our business may be harmed 
any difficulties encountered by the third party shelter services provider with respect to hiring and retaining qualified personnel  and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards  controls  procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner 
finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive  time consuming or impossible 
we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies  and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends 
we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment  rapid prototyping machines  resin and other advanced materials 
we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies 
in particular  we are committed to purchase all of our resin from a single source and our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by single suppliers 
technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive  time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes 
our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth 
in the event of technology changes  delivery delays or shortages of these items  our business and growth prospects may be harmed 
we have experienced rapid growth  and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business 
we have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in our headcount increased from approximately employees as of december  to approximately  employees as of december  this expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls  both in the us and internationally 
in particular  rapid growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas  including recruiting and retaining sufficiently skilled personnel  providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards  and preserving our culture and values 
our inability to effectively manage this level of growth could harm our business 
we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products  and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 
our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our domestic market and internationally 
as of december  our sales organization consisted of people of which were direct sales representatives and were sales administration and management 
we do not have any long term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force 
the loss of the services of these key personnel may harm our business 
in the first half of  approximately orthodontic sales representatives  representing approximately of our orthodontic sales force  left align and joined orthoclear 
although we have replaced the majority of these individuals with new sales representatives  to adequately train and successfully deploy new representatives into effected regions and to reestablish strong customer relationships takes time 
if we are unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications  or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to reestablish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time  our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed 
complying with regulations enforced by the food and drug administration fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally 
fda regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things product design  development  manufacture and testing  product labeling  product storage  pre market clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies  which may include any of the following sanctions warning letters  fines  injunctions  consent decrees and civil penalties  repair  replacement  refunds  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our requests for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  new intended uses  or modifications to existing products  withdrawing clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted  and criminal prosecution 
if any of these events were to occur  they could harm our business 
we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections 
we and our third party shelter services provider have not yet been subject to an fda inspection  and we cannot assure you we or our third party shelter services provider will successfully pass such an inspection in the future 
our failure or the failure of our third party shelter services provider to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or the failure to comply with applicable manufacturing regulations could result in enforcement action  and we may be required to find alternative manufacturers  which could be a long and costly process 
before we can sell a new medical device in the us  or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval  unless an exemption applies 
obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda  we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future 
furthermore  we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future 
our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 
if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised  patient care could suffer  and we could be liable for related damages  and our reputation could be impaired 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
if we fail to meet our clients expectations regarding the security of healthcare information  we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired 
in addition  patient care could suffer  and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner 
our insurance may not protect us from this risk 
if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us  we may not be able to grow our business 
participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
furthermore  our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa  including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services  result in delays or cancellations of orders  or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants 
the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 
extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 
in addition to medical device laws and regulations  numerous state and federal healthcare related laws regulate our business  covering areas such as storage  transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records  prohibitions against the offer  payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order  purchase or recommendation of our products  and the marketing and advertising of our products 
complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time consuming  and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 
we face risks related to our international sales  including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 
we currently sell our products in europe  canada  the united kingdom  mexico  brazil  australia and hong kong  and may expand into other countries from time to time 
recently  we announced our intention to launch sales of invisalign in japan 
we do not know whether orthodontists  gps and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 
in addition  sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval  and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements 
we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future 
we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals 
if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us  or if we fail to receive these approvals  we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner  if at all 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims  and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 
medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable 
although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance  adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
a product liability claim  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  could result in significant legal defense costs 
these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management s attention away from the operation of our business  and could harm our business 
in fiscal and fiscal  the market price for our common stock was volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the factors include quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity  changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results  speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations  strategic actions by our competitors  such as product announcements or acquisitions  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  and general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future  we would incur substantial legal fees  and our management s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 
future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 
a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders 
these stockholders have sold in the past  and may sell in the future  large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations  such as expensing of stock options  could result in unfavorable accounting charges 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows revenue recognition  accounting for share based payments  and accounting for income taxes 
in particular  the fasb recently enacted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which we will adopt effective in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we expect that sfas r will have a significant adverse effect on our reported financial results and may impact the way in which we conduct our business  which may affect our stock price 
we have made use of a shareholders rights plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired  which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
to date  our board of directors has designated  shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights plan 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of our company or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock 
the shareholder rights plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the shareholder rights plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation  purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights plan

ormco on january   ormco corporation ormco filed suit against us in the united states district court for the central district  orange county division  asserting infringement of us patent nos 
  and  the complaint sought unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief 
on february   we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and non infringement of the asserted patents 
in addition  we counterclaimed for infringement of our us patent no 
 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief 
ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on march  and asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and non infringement of us patent no 
 we amended our counterclaim to add allesee orthodontic appliances  inc aoa  a wholly owned subsidiary of ormco  as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of us patent no 
 the court then permitted ormco to amend its complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional patent each 
ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of us patent no 
 on october  on october   we filed an answer to ormco s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and non infringement of us patent no 
 and for infringement of us patent no 
 in connection with these claims  the court granted five motions for summary judgment that we filed 
first  on may   the court granted our motion for summary judgment of non infringement  finding that our invisalign system does not infringe any of the asserted ormco patents    and 
second  on july   the court granted in part our motion for summary judgment of infringement  finding that ormco and aoa infringe certain  but not all  claims of our patents nos 
 and  through the manufacture and sale of red  white blue appliances 
third  on august   the court granted our motion for summary judgment of invalidity of ormco s asserted patents claims    and 
as noted above  the court earlier found that we do not infringe these patents 
in addition  the court also denied ormco s and aoa s motion for summary judgment seeking a finding of invalidity of our asserted patent claims  and 
fourth  the court granted our summary judgment motion that our asserted patent claims are not invalid based on the evidence currently before the court 
although the court granted that motion  it reopened discovery on two additional invalidity arguments ormco and aoa asserted 
fifth  the court also granted our summary judgment motion that our patents are not unenforceable and granted ormco s and aoa s summary judgment motion that ormco and aoa did not willfully infringe our patents 
on december   we filed a further summary judgment motion that our asserted claims are not invalid based on ormco s and aoa s new evidence 
ormco and aoa filed a counter summary judgment motion that our asserted claims are invalid based on this new evidence 
the motions were heard by the court on february  on february   the court granted our motion in part  confirming the validity of all of the asserted claims of our  patent and two of the asserted claims of our  patent 
the court also granted ormco s and aoa s motion in part  finding certain claims of our  patent to be invalid in view of prior use evidence 
on march   ormco and aoa moved for reconsideration of the court s ruling that claims and of our us patent no 
 are not invalid 
on april   upon a motion for reconsideration made by ormco and aoa  the court advised that it would adhere to its previous ruling that claims and of our  patent are not invalid 
on march   we filed a motion for permanent injunction to prevent ormco and aoa from selling the infringing red  white blue system 
on may   the court issued a permanent injunction the permanent injunction to enjoin ormco and aoa from further infringement of claims and of our  patent and claims and of our  patent 
on may   ormco and aoa noticed an appeal to the federal circuit from the permanent injunction 
as of the date of this report on form k  the permanent injunction remains in full force and effect 
on february   we entered into a settlement agreement the settlement agreement with ormco and aoa 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  the issues of past damages  willfulness and attorneys fees for ormco s and aoa s adjudged infringement of our us patent nos 
 and  the align patents through the manufacture and sale by ormco and aoa of its red  white blue appliances has been settled 
the settlement agreement does not affect ormco and aoa s currently pending appeal of the permanent injunction preventing ormco and aoa from selling the infringing red  white blue system  any appeal by ormco of the decisions and orders of the united states district court relating to ormco s patents  or any appeal by us of the orders of the united states district court relating to our patents 
in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement  ormco and aoa will pay us  the settlement amount to resolve the issues of past damages  willfulness and attorneys fees for the adjudged infringement of the align patents through the manufacture and sale of ormco s and aoa s red  white blue appliances 
the settlement amount will be paid into escrow pending the completion of the appeals process 
our receipt of the payments out of escrow is contingent upon the court  in a final  non appealable judgment  finding that ormco or aoa infringes at least one of the claims in the align patents 
if  however  the court issues a final  non appealable judgment of non infringement  invalidity or unenforceability with respect to each asserted claim of the align patents  all funds in the escrow account will be returned to ormco and aoa 
once final judgment was entered  ormco filed a notice of appeal from the final judgment 
the time has not yet expired for us to file a cross appeal on the few issues that were not previously resolved in our favor 
other matters during fiscal  requests were filed with the united states patent and trademark office uspto by a san francisco  california  law firm  acting on behalf of an unnamed party  requesting re examination of six of our patents us patent nos 
     and 
the uspto has granted the request to reexamine five of the six patents  specifically  patent no 
 patent no 
 patent no 
 patent no 
 and patent no 
 as of the date of this report on form k  the uspto issued initial office actions with regard to us patent nos 
 the patent   the patent and  the patent 
in these initial office actions  the examiners confirmed the validity of three of the twenty six claims of the patent and five of the eleven claims of the patent without amendment and preliminarily rejected the remaining claims of the patents 
in addition  the examiners preliminarily rejected all the claims in the patent 
these non final initial office actions present align with its first opportunity to respond to the uspto s review and interpretation of the prior art 
we may and intend to submit amendments  affidavits or declarations  or other documents as evidence of patentability in response to its actions on the  and patents 
the re examination proceedings on patent nos 
  collectively  the remaining patents are currently pending but no office action has been received by us 
while the pending re examinations are in a preliminary stage  we believe that claims of the patents in re examination will be determined to be patentable as currently written or as may be amended during the re examination proceeding 
however  there can be no assurance that we will prevail  and re examination proceedings could result in some or all of the remaining patent claims as well as the  and patent claims having a narrower scope of coverage or even to being invalidated  which could have an adverse effect on us 
on december   in a non appealable  final order  the uspto denied the request for re examination with respect to all twenty one claims of our us patent no 
 the patent 
accordingly  the validity of all twenty one claims of our patent stand reaffirmed by the uspto 
on january   a petition seeking review of denial of request for re examination of the patent was filed by the same san francisco  california law firm 
as of the date of this report on form k  we have not received a response from the uspto 
on july   bay materials  llc bay filed suit against us in the superior court of the state of california for the county of san mateo 
the complaint  as amended  asserts  among other things  breach of contract  promissory estoppel  fraud and negligent misrepresentation by us 
bay alleges that we breached the terms of a purchase order by failing to pay for unshipped goods manufactured by bay pursuant to such order 
bay further alleges that we promised to purchase from bay an alternative polyurethane product  and bay relied on this representation to develop such an alternative product which we determined not to use 
the complaint seeks monetary damages of million related to breach of contract and research and development costs incurred plus unspecified damages related to lost profit  punitive and exemplary damages  and legal expenses 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
litigating claims of these types  whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us  is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 
any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
from time to time  we have received  and may again receive  letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights 
while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention  there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

overview align technology  founded in april  designs  manufactures and markets invisalign  a proprietary method for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear  nearly invisible  removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position 
because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires  invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces 
invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens with mature dentition 
we received fda clearance to market invisalign in  and we began commercial operations in july the invisalign system is manufactured in phases 
the initial step in our manufacturing process is the creation of electronic treatment plans using clincheck  an internally developed computer modeling program 
these treatment plans are developed at our operations facility in costa rica and are made available to the prescribing dental professional via our proprietary customer interfacing software  vip 
the prescribing orthodontist or general practitioner dentist gp then reviews the clincheck simulation 
clincheck allows the orthodontist or gp to simulate treatment in three dimensions by modeling two week stages of tooth movement 
upon the dental professional s approval of the clincheck simulation  we use the data underlying the simulation  in conjunction with stereolithography sla technology  to manufacture aligner molds 
a third party shelter services provider located in juarez  mexico uses these molds to fabricate aligners 
aligners are thin  clear plastic  removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two week stage of the clincheck simulation 
aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by a dental professional using clincheck 
after the aligners are produced  our third party shelter services provider ships the finished products to our customers 
we generate the vast majority of our revenues from the sales of the invisalign system to orthodontists and gps in the united states and canada  our domestic market 
for the year ended december   sales of invisalign in our domestic gp channel and our domestic orthodontist channel represented approximately and of our total revenues  respectively 
a number of factors  the most important of which are set forth below  may affect our success during and beyond 
increased pricing pressure 
in may  orthoclear  inc announced the commercial launch of the orthoclear system  a product that is intended to compete directly with our invisalign system 
we believe that orthoclear s product infringes on our intellectual property and we have filed several lawsuits alleging  among other things  orthoclear s unlawful use of our intellectual property  including our trade secrets 
see part i  item legal proceedings of this report on form k for a more complete summary of the orthoclear litigation 
in response to orthoclear s launch and in an effort to simplify our pricing structure  in the fourth quarter of we announced that all invisalign cases other than invisalign express in our domestic market will have a list price of  per case 
previously  list prices ranged from  to  per case depending on the treatment option selected 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we expanded our volume based discount program to all doctors 
we expect each of these programs  and other similar programs that we may launch in  to adversely affect our revenue  gross margin and net profits 
disruption in sales coverage and customer relationships 
in the first half of  orthodontic sales representatives  representing approximately of our orthodontic sales force  left align and joined orthoclear 
we have replaced the majority of these individuals with new sales representatives 
case submissions in our orthodontic channel were slightly lower in the last two quarters of compared to the previous two quarters due in part to the disruption in our sales force and the resulting disruption to many of our key customer relationships 
we are committed to train and successfully deploy our new sales team and rebuild these disrupted customer relationships 
see part i  item a risk factors we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products  any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 
penetration into our domestic market 
although we have historically generated a majority of our revenues from orthodontists  there exists a significantly greater number of gps in north america than orthodontists 
as the primary provider of dental care  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists  and possess a unique opportunity to educate these patients on the benefits of oral care and introduce them to invisalign 
gps also have the ability to refer appropriate cases to orthodontists and may choose to treat less complex cases themselves 
largely due to the fact that there are significantly more gps than orthodontists  we expect that an increasingly larger percentage of our revenues will be generated by gps 
in fact  in fiscal  our domestic gp channel generated of our total revenue  while the orthodontist channel represented 
we believe that by focusing on increasing utilization rates among our existing gp customers  the overall market for invisalign will increase  as patients who would not have otherwise sought orthodontic treatment are introduced to invisalign by their gps 
in addition  by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique  we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option 
in  four dental schools  harvard university  columbia university  temple university and the university of texas at san antonio  announced the integration of the invisalign technique into their curriculums 
we expect additional dental schools to integrate the invisalign technique into their curriculums in the future 
continued product leadership 
we are committed to investing in delivering new products  enhancing the user experience and introducing new product features to our existing products 
in the second half of  we launched invisalign express  a lower cost aligner system to be used for less complex cases 
invisalign express is intended to assist our customers to treat a broader range of patients by providing a lower cost option for less complex orthodontic cases thereby increasing the market for our products 
in addition  we are currently in the early testing of a bracket positioning template which  if successfully launched  is intended to be used in conjunction with our digital treatment plan in order to guide doctors in proper bracket placement in traditional wires and bracket treatment 
we are also planning to introduce a compliance indicator which will help doctors and patients understand if the patients have worn their aligners for enough time to effectively move their teeth 
by investing in developing these new products and continually enhancing our existing products  we expect to increase market share 
expansion of international markets 
we will focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in key international markets  including europe and japan 
we will consider expanding into additional international markets on a case by case basis 
in october  we announced the launch of invisalign in japan 
in fiscal  our international channel represented approximately of our total revenue 
increasing reliance on international manufacturing operations 
our manufacturing efficiency has been and will be an important factor in our future profitability 
we use a third party based in juarez  mexico  international manufacturing solutions operaciones  srl ims  for the fabrication and packaging of aligners 
we are currently in the process of relocating our sla mold fabrication operations from our santa clara  california facility to ims 
we expect this relocation to be complete by the second quarter of as a result of this relocation  our reliance on our international manufacturing operations will continue to increase 
our success will depend in part on the efforts and abilities of management to effectively manage this international operation  including our relationship with ims 
in addition  we currently are and will become increasingly dependant on ims s ability to hire and retain employees generally  as well as hire and retain employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations 
if our management and or ims fail in any of these respects  we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 
in addition  even if we have case submissions in the manufacturing backlog  if ims is unable for any of these or other reasons to timely ship our product to our customers  our revenue will be delayed which will cause our operating results to fluctuate 
see part i  item a risk factors for risks related to our international operations 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues invisalign product revenues by channel and other revenue  which represented training and sales of ancillary products  for the years ended december   and  are as follows years ended december  revenues change change change change in millions domestic orthodontic gp international total invisalign other revenue total revenue revenue grew by for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the growth in revenues resulted primarily from an increase in overall case shipment volume in the domestic gp channel driven by an increase in the number of participating clinicians and the launch of invisalign express in the third quarter of additionally  international sales improved primarily as a result of increased number of participating clinicians and case utilization by our european practitioners 
for the year ended december   growth in revenues from our domestic orthodontic and general practitioner channels over fiscal resulted primarily from higher case volumes driven by an increase in the number of participating clinicians and utilization within the general practitioner practices 
higher product sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal also benefited from increased promotional advertising campaigns and sales initiatives in effect during fiscal for the fiscal year  although we expect our case shipment volume to increase  we anticipate that our revenues will remain consistent with fiscal year in  we will begin to see the full impact of the lower average selling price resulting from both the pricing initiatives we introduced during the fourth quarter of  and invisalign express  which we launched in the third quarter of and has a lower average selling price than our full invisalign product 
cost of revenues years ended december  change change in millions cost of revenues of revenues gross profits of revenues cost of revenues includes the salaries for staff involved in the production process  the cost of materials  packaging  shipping costs  depreciation on the capital equipment used in the production process  training costs and the cost of facilities 
gross margin improved to of revenues for the fiscal year ended december   compared to of revenues for the year ended december  this improvement in gross margin is primarily the result of cost savings achieved from manufacturing process improvements and increased cost absorption due to higher production volumes partially offset by increased training costs as a result of dental professionals auditing training classes for no charge 
gross margin for the year ended december  improved to of revenues  compared to of revenues for the year ended december  the higher gross margin for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to improved fixed cost absorption related to increasing volumes  manufacturing process improvements in both our treatment operations facility in costa rica and in the aligner fabrication process 
also included in cost of revenues are stock based compensation expenses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year  we anticipate that our gross margin  including stock based compensation  will decrease slightly  primarily as we begin to see the full impact of the lower average selling price discussed in revenues above 
sales and marketing years ended december  change change in millions sales and marketing of revenues sales and marketing expense includes sales force compensation combined with travel related costs and expenses for professional marketing programs  expenses relating to conducting workshops and market surveys  advertising  and dental professional trade show attendance 
sales and marketing expense increased by million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to incremental head count which resulted in higher payroll costs of million  million related to increased advertising  media and trade show costs  an additional million on outside services and other sales and marketing support costs  and million of expenses attributable to retention incentives and guarantees paid to our sales force in response to the solicitation of our sales force by orthoclear during the first quarter of the increase in sales and marketing expense during fiscal was consistent with our marketing and sales initiatives 
we expect sales and marketing expense  including stock based compensation  to be comparable to  as we continue to develop and expand our domestic and international markets  develop new media programs  enhance our web site and provide clinical education 
sales and marketing expense increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from an increase in spending of million related to incremental headcount in our north american sales and marketing work force  million related to north america sales force training  million related to our international workforce and outside services  and million related to increases in media  advertising costs  marketing promotions and other related expenses 
the increase in spending was partially offset by the decrease of million in stock based compensation expense 
sales and marketing expense includes stock based compensation expenses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative years ended december  change change in millions general and administrative of revenues general and administrative expense includes salaries for administrative personnel  outside consulting services  legal expenses and general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expense increased by million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  during we incurred million of incremental expense related to the orthoclear litigation  which resulted from higher external legal and consulting costs and the hiring of additional legal staff 
compared to year ended december   general and administrative expenses decreased by million for the year ended december   primarily due to the decrease in stock based compensation expense of million and legal fees of million 
the decrease in litigation spending was primarily due to the settlement charge of million included in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  related to the conclusion of the discus arbitration proceedings 
the decreased expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  were offset by increases of million in payroll expenses and million in general corporate expenses 
for the fiscal year  we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase from fiscal this increase will be primarily attributable to stock based compensation and orthoclear related expenses 
general and administrative expenses include stock based compensation expenses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development years ended december  change change in millions research and development of revenues research and development expense includes the costs associated with software engineering  the cost of designing  developing and testing our products and conducting clinical and post marketing trials 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expense increased by million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the primary reasons for the higher expenses in  compared to  were an increase of million in outside services and consulting expenses  million of additional payroll related costs due to higher headcount and a million increase in training and other research and development expenses 
the million increase in research and development expense for the year ended december   over the year ended december   resulted from increased spending of million for product improvement initiatives and a million severance charge related to the departure of our vice president  engineering  partially offset by a million decrease in stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses included million and million of stock based compensation for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for fiscal  we expect a slight increase in research and development spending  including stock based compensation  over as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to bring new products to market  conduct clinical research and focus on product improvement initiatives 
interest and other income expense  net years ended december  change change in millions interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  includes interest income earned on cash balances  interest expense on debt  foreign currency translation gains and losses for the dollar against other currencies related to international businesses and other miscellaneous charges 
interest and other income and expenses for the year ended december   included interest income of million  which resulted from higher interest rates and average cash balances during  offset by exchange losses of million and million of interest expense  bank charges and other expense 
for year ended december   interest and other income and expense included interest income of million  exchange gains of million  offset by interest expense of million and of other expense and bank charges 
for the year ended december   interest income was million  exchange gains were million  which were reduced by interest expense of million and other expenses of million 
income tax provision years ended december  change change in millions provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
as of december   we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing deferred tax assets due to uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize these assets before they expire 
as a result  our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 
at december   we had a net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  these carryforwards will begin to expire beginning in for federal purposes and for california purposes 
the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation s tax attributes if a corporation undergoes an ownership change for tax purposes 
if an ownership change is determined to have occurred  our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation 
however  based on our current estimate of the total net operating losses at december  and our current estimate of the annual limitation had a change of ownership occurred  we do not expect current utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards to result in a limitation prior to utilization 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
we have not provided additional us income taxes on undistributed earnings from non us operations as of december  because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the united states 
stock based compensation years ended december  change change in millions stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and non employees prior to  we recorded deferred stock based compensation as a component of stockholders equity 
stock based compensation was fully amortized as of december  for options granted to non employees  we measure the option s fair value using the black scholes valuation model at each reporting period and recognize stock based compensation as options vest  which is generally four years 
this stock based compensation is amortized as charges to operations over the vesting periods of the options 
historically  we have accelerated the vesting of options to several employees in connection with severance packages 
these accelerations were accounted for as a charge to the consolidated statements of operations 
this charge is equal to the intrinsic value of the options which was calculated as a difference between the exercise price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of the acceleration 
for the year ended december   we recorded million resulting from accelerated vesting of options in connection with severance packages 
for the year ended december   deferred stock based compensation expenses included million of amortization of deferred compensation expenses  million of expense relating to options granted to non employees  and million of expenses resulting from accelerated vesting of options in connection with severance packages 
for fiscal the year ended december  we recorded million of amortization of deferred compensation expense  million of expenses relating to options granted to non employees and million of expenses resulting from accelerated vesting of options in connection with severance packages 
option acceleration 
on october   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved acceleration of the vesting for all unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than 
options held by non employee directors are excluded from the vesting acceleration 
as a result of the acceleration  approximately million options or of the total outstanding options became immediately exercisable as of october  of the aggregate number of options subject to the acceleration  approximately million options or of the total accelerated options were held by our executive officers 
because the exercise price of all options subject to acceleration was greater than the fair market value of our underlying common stock on the date of acceleration  we did not record any compensation expense  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the primary purpose of the acceleration was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of fas r 
fas r is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of  and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of operations  rather than as a footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial statements

under the new standard  our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we will begin recording the fair value of our share based compensation in our financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

although the adoption of sfas r will have no adverse impact to our balance sheet and cash flows  it will adversely affect our net profit loss and earnings loss per share

in accordance with this standard a grant date of an award exists if a the award is unilateral grant and b the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval 
we will adopt this standard when we adopt fas r beginning in the first quarter of  and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r

sfas no 
also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas no is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp and  which clarifies when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of the other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp and are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december  at december   we have no unrealized investment losses that had not been recognized as other than temporary impairments in our available for sale securities 
we do not anticipate that the implementation of these statements will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock and from cash generated from sales of our product 
our cash and cash equivalents balance improved for the year ended december   to million from million for the year ended december  restricted cash was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we generated cash of million and million from our operating activities during the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december   resulted primarily from operating profits adjusted for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities partially offset by reductions in accounts payable 
for the year ended december   net cash was provided by operating activities primarily from operating profits adjusted for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue  which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 
we used million of cash for our investing activities for the year ended december  this included million of cash used to purchase capital assets  and million of net cash used to purchase general orthodontics  llc 
for the year ended december   we used million of our cash in investing activities  primarily to purchase property and equipment for capacity expansion and manufacturing improvements  including approximately million for the implementation of the new version of our enterprise resource planning system and new software for our manufacturing execution system 
partially offsetting these purchases were proceeds from the sale of equipment and maturities of marketable securities during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   and  net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  primarily from exercises of employee stock options  partially offset by payments on debt obligations related to the equipment based term loan and capital lease obligations 
in december  we obtained a million equipment based term loan under our revolving line of credit 
this loan accrued interest at a rate of above prime 
during fiscal year  we paid down the outstanding balance of million with interest  drawn under this facility 
in december  we renegotiated and amended our existing revolving line of credit 
the amended credit agreement increases the available borrowings under the revolving line of credit from million to million 
included in the new revolving line of credit is a letter of credit facility of up to million  a foreign exchange facility of up to million and an equipment facility of up to million 
we may elect interest rates on our borrowing calculated by reference to bank s prime rate less one half of one percent or libor plus two percent 
the new credit facility matures on december   at which time all outstanding borrowings must be repaid 
the new credit facility contains certain restrictive loan covenants  including  among others  financial covenants requiring a minimum quick ratio and minimum tangible net worth  and covenants limiting our ability to dispose of assets  make acquisitions  be acquired  incur indebtedness  grant liens  make investments  pay dividends and repurchase stock 
as of december   there was no outstanding borrowing under these credit facilities 
contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations equipment purchase agreement computer support services total includes an early termination fee of approximately  on our facility in amsterdam  the netherlands 
the lease expires in with an option to cancel in equipment for manufacturing operations in mexico 
we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations promulgated under the securities act 
as discussed under part i item legal proceedings  we are currently involved in litigation with various parties 
each of these proceedings is in its early stages and it is not yet possible to determine its ultimate outcome 
at this time we cannot estimate the impact this litigation may have on our future cash requirements 
we expect that our expense levels for  including stock based compensation  will increase from  depending on our level of business activity 
we expect that any increases will be focused on continuing efforts to automate our manufacturing processes  capacity expansion requirements  the size of our sales force and dental professional training staff  continued international sales and marketing efforts  legal expenses including million to million related to orthoclear litigation  and research and development expenses as we develop new products and improvements to our existing product 
in addition  we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market  sell and support our products on a worldwide basis 
our incentive plan allows for the issuance of restricted stock units rsus  among other things 
we have recently granted rsus  together with stock options  to certain of our employees 
rsus do not generate cash  as a result  by granting rsus we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we could be required to delay implementing our business strategy and reduce our expenditures in general 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  legal contingencies and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements to sell products  services  and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products 
revenue from product sales  net of discounts and rebates  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service revenues are recorded when completed 
other multiple element arrangements require delivery of products in the future 
we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
revenue is deferred on the undelivered element based on a historical usage rate and recognized when delivery occurs 
the amount of revenue deferred is affected by the historical breakage factor  and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
product warranty we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship until the invisalign case is completed 
we accrue for estimated warranty in costs of goods sold upon the shipment of products 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
we regularly review the accrued balances and update these balances based on historical warranty cost trends 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
if we were to experience higher rates of warranty events  we would be required to accrue additional warranty costs  which would negatively affect our operating results 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
because of uncertainties related to both the potential amount and range of loss from pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an unfavorable outcome in these legal proceedings 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to this pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly 
revisions of our estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred tax valuation allowance we have established a full valuation allowance because we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is not likely 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance  we would decrease the valuation allowance to take into account deferred tax assets that we could realize 
a decrease in the valuation allowance could have a favorable impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the decrease 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable equity securities 
periodically we invest our excess cash in low risk and short term available for sale marketable equity securities
