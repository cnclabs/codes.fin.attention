growth in revenue  to date  has generally been the result of establishing offices in major markets 
the following table summarizes for each fiscal year the number of offices opened  international expansion and the creation of additional service lines 

table of contents fiscal year number of united states offices opened number of international operations opened service line established nine finance and accounting nine ten information management four three human resources management nine one two six one resources audit solutions  supply chain management via acquisition two opened  two consolidation closures seven opened via acquisition  one organic two opened  two consolidation closures one opened via acquisition  two organic legal three two opened via acquisition  eight organic during fiscal  we continued our expansion around the world  opening offices in five additional european countries and in beijing  people s republic of china  singapore and brisbane  australia

the acquisition of the operations of the non assurance accounting practice in india discussed above was completed on april  for approximately  in cash and  in stock 
the stock  though not issued as of may   is priced at per share  resulting in the future issuance of  shares 
the acquisition agreement provides for an additional payment of up to  in cash and  in stock if the practice meets certain financial goals for the period from march  through february  we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our associates 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients in the united states on a weekly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our associates 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process and represented  and of our revenue for the years ended may   and  respectively 
we periodically review our outstanding accounts receivable balance and determine an estimate of the amount of those receivables we believe may prove uncollectible 
our provision for bad debts is included in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the costs to pay our professional associates and all related benefit and incentive costs  including provisions for paid time off and other employee benefits  are included in direct cost of services 
we pay most of our associates on an hourly basis for all hours worked on client engagements and  therefore  direct cost of services tends to vary directly with the volume of revenue we earn 
we expense the benefits we pay to our associates as they are earned 
these benefits include paid time off and holidays  a bonus incentive plan  referral bonus programs  subsidized group health  dental and life insurance programs  a matching k retirement plan  the ability to participate in the company s employee stock purchase plan  and professional development and career training 
in addition  we pay the related costs of employment  including state and federal payroll taxes  workers compensation insurance  unemployment insurance and other costs 
typically  an associate must work a threshold number of hours to be eligible for all of the benefits 
we recognize direct cost of services when incurred 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses include the payroll and related costs of our internal management as well as general and administrative  marketing and recruiting costs 
our sales and marketing efforts are led by our management team who are salaried employees and earn bonuses based on operating results for our company as a whole and within each individual s geographic market 
the company s fiscal year consists of or weeks  ending on the last saturday in may 
for fiscal years of weeks  such as fiscal  the first three quarters consist of weeks each and the fourth quarter consists of weeks 
the actual quarter end dates for fiscal and were as follows for fiscal  august  first quarter  november  second quarter  february  third quarter  and may  fourth quarter  and for fiscal  august  first quarter  november  second quarter  february  third quarter  and may  fourth quarter  and 
for convenience  all references herein to years or annual periods of one or more years are to years or annual periods ended may critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
under the current accounting standard  our goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer subject to periodic amortization over their estimated useful lives 
these assets are now considered to have an indefinite life and their carrying values are required to be assessed by us for impairment at least annually 
depending on future market values of our stock  our operating performance and other factors  these assessments could potentially result in impairment reductions of these intangible assets in the future and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our clients failing to make required payments for services rendered 
we estimate this allowance based upon our knowledge of the financial condition of our clients  review of historical receivable and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates or we note an unfavorable trend in aggregate receivable collections  additional allowances may be required and these additional allowances may materially affect the company s future financial results 
income taxes in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates of income taxes  if applicable  in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of any current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we will establish a valuation allowance 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in recording additional tax expense 
if the ultimate tax liability differs from the amount of tax expense we have reflected in the consolidated statements of income  an adjustment of tax expense may need to be recorded and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our associates 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients in the united states on a weekly basis 
some of our clients served by our international operations are billed on a monthly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our associates 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of income data 
these historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results

table of contents year ended may  compared to year ended may  computations of percentage change period over period are based upon the truncated numbers presented herein 
revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the continued expansion of our scope of services and improved overall demand for our services triggered the increase in revenue  resulting in more billable hours for our associates and an improvement in rate per hour 
we believe our business expanded due in part to increasing market awareness of our ability to provide services 
in particular  finance and accounting services increased significantly in the current year compared to the prior year 
we believe one of the reasons for the increase in these types of engagements is new projects from existing clients who had engaged us to provide services during their initial phase of compliance with sarbanes 
to a lesser extent  all of our other service lines experienced growth in fiscal compared to fiscal except for the ras service line 
though we believe we have improved the awareness of our service offerings with clients and prospective clients because of assistance we have provided during the first two years of compliance with sarbanes  there can be no assurance that there will be continuing demand for sarbanes or related internal accounting control services 
average bill rates improved by compared to the prior year average bill rate 
the increase in revenue was also driven by the increase in the number of associates on assignment from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal we operated and offices during the final quarters of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our clients do not sign long term contracts with us 
therefore  our future revenue or operating results cannot be reliably predicted from previous quarters or from extrapolation of past results 
revenue for domestic united states offices improved or million from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  revenue for the dutch practice improved or million  from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the other international offices revenue grew or million  from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  revenue growth in the international practices was approximately million less in fiscal compared to fiscal than would have been the case using local currencies  due to the strengthening of the united states dollar against international currencies 
virtually all international practices enjoyed growth both from referrals from the united states as well as from internally generated opportunities  particularly in the united kingdom  sweden  japan  hong kong  france and canada 
direct cost of services 
direct cost of services increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the increase in direct cost of services was attributable to the previously described expansion of the scope of services resulting in more chargeable hours for our associates at higher average pay rates  overall  the average pay rate per hour increased by year over year 
the direct cost of services as a percentage of revenue the direct cost of services percentage was and for the year ended may  and  respectively 
the direct cost of services percentage increased between the two years because the volume of client reimbursable expenses was higher in fiscal  as the number of projects requiring associate travel increased 
in addition  a slight improvement in the ratio of direct associate salary expense compared to hourly revenue generated in fiscal was offset by a slight increase in compensation related benefits 
the cost of compensation and related benefits offered to the associates of our international offices has been greater as a percentage of revenue than our domestic operations 
in addition  international offices use independent contractors more extensively 
thus  the direct cost of services percentage of our international offices has usually exceeded our domestic operation s targeted direct cost of services percentage of 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  
table of contents as the company hired additional personnel across the enterprise to support and position the larger organization for future revenue growth 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  in particular  compensation and related benefit expenses increased as management and administrative headcount grew from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal the increase in dollars spent on compensation was primarily attributable to the increase in salaries and benefit costs as a result of the larger headcount 
other increases in fiscal were bonus expense as a result of the company s improved revenue results and costs associated with the rollout of the company s new information technology system and european service center 
these increases were partially offset by reduced provision for doubtful accounts during fiscal and the reduction of spending on national advertising compared to fiscal amortization and depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets was approximately million in both fiscal and the company has not completed an analysis of the allocation of goodwill related to its purchase during the fourth quarter of fiscal of a practice with offices operating in bangalore and mumbai  india 
the company will consider a number of factors in performing this valuation  including a valuation of identifiable intangible assets 
also  during fiscal  amortization related to the company s acquisitions of the procurement centre  llc in fiscal and policyiq in fiscal will cease 
absent potential amortization related to the indian acquisition  amortization is expected to be million during fiscal depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the increase in depreciation was related to a higher asset base due to the investments made in offices relocated or expanded since may  and investments in the company s new operating system and other information technology 
also  in october  the company completed the purchase of an office building in irvine  california for approximately million 
the company expects to transition its corporate office and domestic service center to the new location during fiscal as the company completes the implementation of its information technology system  makes improvements to the new office building in anticipation of the corporate relocation and invests in expanded or new office space for existing offices  it is expected that the company s depreciation expense will increase 
interest income 
during fiscal  interest income was million compared to interest income of million in fiscal the increase in interest income is a combination of a higher average balance available for investment in fiscal and higher interest rates during fiscal the company has invested available cash in money market and commercial paper investments that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
in addition  as of may   the company has million of investments in government agency bonds with remaining maturity dates between three months and one year from the balance sheet date classified as short term investments and considered held to maturity securities 
in addition  the company also holds million in government agency bonds with maturity dates in excess of one year from the balance sheet date 
the bonds  classified as long term investments  mature through may and have coupon rates ranging from to 
these investments have been classified in the may  consolidated balance sheet as held to maturity securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the increase was the result of the company s higher pre tax income during fiscal  offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from in fiscal to in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was lower in fiscal due primarily to the impact on the tax provision of the improved operating results of the company s international offices with lower statutory tax rates than the united states 
periodically  the company reviews the components of both book and taxable income to analyze the adequacy of the tax provision 
there can be no assurance that the company s effective tax rate will not increase in the future 

table of contents year ended may  compared to year ended may  the comments for the year ended may  below include the results of operations for nordic spring from august  through may  the results of operations for the year ended may  include the results of operations of the following acquisitions for the following periods for resources global professionals australia  a full year of results of operations  for resources global professionals in the netherlands  results of operations from july  through may   and for policyiq  results of operations from july  through may  computations of percentage change period over period are based upon the truncated numbers presented herein 
revenue 
revenue increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the continued expansion of our scope of services and improved overall demand for our services triggered the increase in revenue  resulting in more billable hours for our associates and an improvement in rate per hour 
we believe our business expanded due in part to increasing market awareness of our ability to provide services 
in particular  ras engagements increased significantly in fiscal we believe one of the reasons for the increase in ras engagements was the need generated by companies with calendar year end deadlines for initial compliance with the requirements of section of sarbanes 
average bill rates improved by compared to the prior year average bill rate 
the increase in revenue for the year was also due to the increase in the number of associates on assignment from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal we operated offices  including international offices  during the final quarter of fiscal  compared to offices  including international offices  in the last quarter of fiscal revenue for united states offices improved or million from million for the fiscal year ended may  to million for the fiscal year ended may  revenue for the dutch practice improved or million  from million for the fiscal year ended may  to million for the fiscal year ended may   however  the may  results include amounts only from july  date of acquisition 
approximately million of the increase in dutch revenues was from the impact of foreign currency translation due to the weaker united states dollar during fiscal compared to fiscal the other international offices revenue grew or million  from million for the fiscal year ended may  to million for the fiscal year ended may  approximately million of the increase in the other international revenues was from the impact of foreign currency translation due to the weaker united states dollar during fiscal compared to fiscal nevertheless  all international practices enjoyed growth  particularly in the united kingdom  canada and japan 
the fiscal results include three quarters of operations for the nordic spring practice acquired in sweden in august direct cost of services 
direct cost of services increased or million to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the increase in direct cost of services was attributable to the previously described expansion of the scope of services resulting in more chargeable hours for our associates at higher average pay rates 
overall  the average pay rate per hour increased year over year 
the direct cost of services decreased as a percentage of revenue from for fiscal year to for fiscal year the favorable change in the direct cost of services percentage was the result of improvement in the ratio of direct associate salary expense compared to hourly revenue generated  as reflected by the improved average bill rate per hour over average pay rate per hour 
offsetting this improvement was the greater impact of the company s international operations which have a higher direct cost of services percentage higher than the company s targeted and the increase in volume of zero margin client expense reimbursements as the company s projects requiring associate travel increased significantly 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  as 
table of contents a result of improved leverage on fixed operating costs  the increase in revenue for fiscal also outpaced the company s internal hiring 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  in particular  compensation and related benefit expenses increased as management and administrative headcount grew from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal the increase in dollars spent was attributable to the increase in salaries and benefit costs driven by the larger headcount and occupancy and related costs from relocated or expanded offices 
other increases in spending in fiscal were bonus expense as a result of the company s improved revenue results  costs related to the company s compliance with the requirements of sarbanes  recruiting expense to support the need for an increased number of associates  and bad debt expense in line with the company s receivables growth 
amortization and depreciation expenses 
amortization of intangible assets remained steady at approximately million in both fiscal and the initial amortization of the intangible assets identified in the purchase price allocation of nordic spring in fiscal offset the completion of amortization of certain of the intangibles associated with prior year acquisitions 
depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  this increase reflects a full year of depreciation on assets acquired during fiscal  additional depreciation resulting from offices relocated or expanded since may  and investments in information technology 
interest income 
during fiscal  the company generated interest income of million compared to interest income of approximately  in the year ended may  the increase in interest income is a combination of a higher average cash balance available for investment in fiscal and higher interest rates available year over year 
the company has invested available cash in money market and commercial paper investments that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
as of may   the company had million of investments in government agency bonds and other securities with remaining maturity dates between three months and one year from the balance sheet date and million of government agency bonds with remaining maturity dates in excess of one year from the balance sheet date 
the bonds mature through may and have coupon rates ranging from to 
these investments have been classified in the may  consolidated balance sheet as held to maturity securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  as a result of the increase in the company s pre tax income 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal  which differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes  net of federal benefit

certain factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described in part i item a 
risk factors 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by our operations and  historically  to a lesser extent  stock option exercises 
we have generated positive cash flows from operations since inception  and we continued to do so during the year ended may  at may   the company had operating leases  primarily for office premises  expiring at various dates

the company expects to transition its corporate office and domestic service center to the new location during fiscal  however  some of the building will continue to be leased to existing tenants until such time as the company requires use of the entire building 
the remaining amounts used for property and equipment were primarily for technology upgrades to the company s operating systems as well as on leasehold improvements and office equipment during both fiscal and finally  in fiscal  the company used  as part of the consideration for the purchase of a non assurance accounting practice in india  while  in fiscal  the company spent approximately million to acquire nordic spring in sweden 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled  for the year ended may   compared to million for the year ended may  more stock options were exercised and more stock was purchased via the company s employee stock purchase plan in fiscal compared to the prior year 
however  the increased equity plans activity was offset by the company s repurchase during the year of  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share for a total of approximately million 
our ongoing operations and anticipated growth in the geographic markets we currently serve will require us to continue to make investments in capital equipment  primarily technology hardware and software 
in addition  we may consider making strategic acquisitions 
we anticipate that our current cash and the ongoing cash flows from our operations will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  either internally or through acquisition  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or to secure additional debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or the addition of new debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may not be able to obtain financing arrangements in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
in the event we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed  we may be compelled to delay or curtail our plans to develop our business  which could have a material adverse affect on our operations  market position and competitiveness

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that the company recognize in its financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas 
sfas provides relief for entities that use derivatives to economically hedge fluctuations in the fair value of their servicing rights and changes how gains and losses are computed in certain transfers or securitizations 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after september  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments sfas 
sfas allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole  eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host  if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us for the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
this standard requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be expensed in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim period after june  for the company  the first quarter ended august  
the pro forma disclosures permitted under sfas will no longer be allowed as an alternative presentation to recognition in the financial statements 
under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments 
allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the black scholes model 
the company must also determine the transition method to be used in implementing fas r 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r 
the company intends to use the black scholes model for valuation and the prospective method of adoption 
the prospective method requires the company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of sfas r under the fair value method and to expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock option s remaining vesting period 
based on the outstanding stock options granted through may   the company expects to expense approximately million  before income tax effects  in fiscal that would previously have been presented in a pro forma footnote disclosure 
sfas r also requires the company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax 
table of contents deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow  this will possibly reduce the company s future reported cash flow from operating activities as compared to the previous method of reporting 
in addition  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab which expresses the views of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with nonemployees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instrument issues under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of sfas r in an interim period  capitalization of compensation costs related to share based payment arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payments arrangements upon adoption of sfas r  the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of sfas r  and disclosures in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent to adoption of sfas r 
based on the outstanding stock options granted through may   the company expects to expense approximately million  before income tax effects  in fiscal that would previously have been presented in a pro forma footnote disclosure 
the company is evaluating the additional potential impact that sab will have on its consolidated financial position and results of operations when adopted in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million of cash  highly liquid short term investments and long term united states government agency securities 
securities that the company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
these securities consist of commercial paper and government agency bonds 
cost approximates market for these securities 
the earnings on these investments are subject to changes in interest rates  and to the extent interest rates were to decline  it would reduce our interest income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
prior to fiscal  our foreign operations were not significant to our overall operations  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk was low 
however  as our strategy to continue expanding foreign operations progresses  more of our revenues will be derived from foreign operations denominated in the currency of the applicable markets 
for the year ended may   approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside of the united states 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into united states dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
thus  as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our non us based operations  our reported results may vary 
assets and liabilities of our non united states based operations are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate effective at the end of each monthly reporting period 
ninety per cent of our fiscal year end balances of cash  short term investments and investments in marketable securities were denominated in united states dollars
