additionally  under certain of our loan covenants  we are generally obligated to fund of total hotel revenues per quarter on a cumulative basis  to a separate room renovation account for replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment  maintenance  and capital improvements for our hotels 
for  the amounts expended exceeded  in the aggregate  the amounts required under our loan covenants 
if  for any reason  we do not meet the renovation requirements at the individual hotel level  we could be required to fund such shortfalls into cash escrow accounts

table of contents funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines funds from operations  or ffo  as net income loss applicable to common shareholders excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does not include the cost of capital improvements or any related capitalized interest 
we use ffo as a measure of performance to adjust for certain non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization because historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be less informative 
nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide standard measure of reit operating performance 
accordingly  as a member of nareit  equity inns adopted ffo as a measure to evaluate performance and facilitate comparisons between the company and other reits  although our ffo may not be comparable to ffo measures reported by other companies 
additionally  ffo is also used by management in the annual budget process 
the following reconciliation of net income applicable to common shareholders to ffo illustrates the difference in these measures of operating performance in thousands for the years ended december  net income loss applicable to common shareholders add subtract gain loss on sale of hotel properties minority interests income expenses depreciation depreciation from discontinued operations funds from operations ffo weighted average number of diluted common shares and partnership units outstanding for  ffo includes a non cash loss on impairment of hotels of approximately million and approximately  in fees associated with an unsecured debt offering  included as a component of interest expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations  that has been indefinitely postponed due to market conditions 
for  ffo includes a non cash loss on impairment of a hotel of approximately million and a debt prepayment penalty of approximately  included as a component of interest expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
for  ffo includes a net non cash deferred income tax expense of approximately million  a non cash loss on impairment of hotels of approximately million and a loss on redemption of series a preferred stock of approximately million

we also maintain certain contractual agreements with property managers and franchisors that require us to pay fees in conjunction with operating our hotels 
generally  the amounts payable under these agreements are dependent upon the operating results of our hotels 
the following schedule details these fees for the years ended december in thousands management fees franchisor related fees total fees recent accounting pronouncements note of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards affects our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of the management s discussion and analysis and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management contracts our management agreements with hyatt  which purchased the amerisuites brand in january from the blackstone group  which purchased the brand from prime hospitality corporation in october  are structured to provide the trs lessees minimum net operating income at each of our amerisuites hotels 
in addition  the management agreements specify a net operating income threshold for each of our amerisuites hotels 
as the manager  hyatt s subsidiaries can earn an incentive management fee of of hotel net operating income above the threshold  as defined  to a maximum of of gross hotel revenues 
if the management fee calculation exceeds of gross hotel revenues  hyatt s subsidiaries may earn an additional fee of on any additional net operating income 
if a hotel fails to generate net operating income sufficient to reach 
table of contents the threshold  hyatt s subsidiaries are required to contribute the greater of a predetermined minimum return or the net operating income plus of the shortfall between the threshold amount and the net operating income of the hotel 
we record all shortfall contributions as a reduction of base management fees  which are included as a component of direct hotel expenses in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations  when all contingencies related to such amounts have been resolved 
in may  we updated our current franchise contracts and management agreements with hyatt s subsidiaries for all of our amerisuites hotels 
the minimum net operating income guarantee agreements were not extended beyond their original terms and are set to expire in and under the new agreements  we extended the existing franchise agreements to and the management agreements to  as long as hyatt continues to be in compliance with the minimum net operating income guarantees in the original agreements 
for  and  we recorded approximately million  million and million  respectively  in minimum income guarantees from hyatt as a reduction of our base management fee expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
beginning in  when these income guarantees begin to expire  we will no longer record these reductions in base management fees and may be required to pay hyatt base and incentive fees  resulting in an increase rather than a decrease in management fee expense related to these hotels 
the management contracts for our remaining hotels have terms ranging from one to five years and generally provide for payment of management fees ranging from to of hotel revenues and an incentive fee consisting of a percentage of gross operating profits in excess of budget  as defined by the management agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  all estimates are evaluated by our management  including those related to bad debts  carrying value of investments in hotel properties  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
all estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers and other borrowers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level believed adequate by us to absorb estimated probable receivable losses 
our periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is primarily based on past receivable loss experience  known and inherent credit risks  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates including the amounts and timing of future collections 
if the financial condition of our customers or other borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents investment in hotel properties we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in a hotel has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis of the hotel property  or the hotel is being held for sale and a loss in anticipated 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
during  we recorded approximately million of non cash impairment losses related to four hotels and a parcel of land held for hotel development in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  based on the estimated net realizable value of the assets over their remaining estimated holding periods 
one of the hotels  a room hampton inn located in memphis  tennessee  was sold in august for its approximate carrying value of million including the assumption of a million note receivable 
the note receivable bears interest at for five years and thereafter until maturity on september  the note receivable is on a twenty year amortization schedule  and principal and interest is due monthly with a balloon payment due at maturity 
the non cash impairment loss of approximately million related to this hotel has been reclassified  along with operations for all periods presented  to discontinued operations 
impairments of hotels not held for sale are recorded as a component of continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the four impaired hotels have an average age of approximately years 
we classify certain assets as held for sale based on management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions expected to close in the next twelve months 
we consider a hotel as held for sale once we have executed a contract for sale  allowed the buyer to complete its due diligence review  and received a substantial non refundable deposit 
until a buyer has completed its due diligence review of the asset  necessary approvals have been received and substantive conditions to the buyer s obligation to perform have been satisfied  we do not consider a sale to be probable 
when the company identifies an asset as held for sale  we estimate the net realizable value of such asset 
if the net realizable value of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we record an impairment charge for the estimated loss 
we no longer record depreciation expense once we identify an asset as held for sale 
net realizable value is estimated as the amount at which we believe the asset could be bought or sold fair value less estimated costs to sell 
we estimate the fair value by determining prevailing market conditions  appraisals or current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers  if appropriate 
we record operations for hotels designated as held for sale and hotels which have been sold as part of discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we also allocate to discontinued operations the estimated interest on debt that is to be assumed by the buyer and interest on debt that is required to be repaid as a result of the disposal transaction 
for  we did not realize any losses on impairments of hotels held for sale  other than the million non cash impairment loss reclassified as discussed above 
for  we recorded a loss on impairment of a hotel held for sale of approximately million 
impairments recorded  if any  are reflected as a component of discontinued operations for the respective periods in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for joint venture effective january   we formed a joint venture ghii with a furniture and equipment contractor for the purpose of engaging in the sale of furniture and equipment to independent 
table of contents third parties 
we also provide certain management services to ghii for an annual fee of  we also acquired furniture and equipment and related services from our joint venture partner  through a separate entity  for   and of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically  we accounted for this joint venture using the equity method and recorded the income and management service fees as income in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in late  we determined that under the application of the emerging issues task force no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  the company should have recorded amounts received from ghii as a reduction of the related furniture and equipment cost purchased from the joint venture partner  instead of recording such amounts as income 
the cumulative effect of the amounts recorded as income versus reducing our furniture and equipment cost  and related depreciation expense  was a reduction to net income of approximately  the impact was immaterial to all prior quarterly reported amounts and year end reported amounts  thus we recorded the cumulative impact of approximately  as a reduction to net income during the fourth quarter of income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in  we determined  it was more likely than not  that we would not be able to realize our million deferred income tax asset  and we recorded a full valuation allowance for this asset 
our trs lessees continue to accumulate net operating losses primarily due to the lease payments that our trs lessees pay to their respective lessors  in conjunction with our assumption of the operating leases from several of our independent management companies in as a result of these continued losses  we continue to record a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred income tax asset 
additionally  we will not record a deferred income tax benefit until it is more likely than not that such benefit will be realized

table of contents costs 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings under our line of credit through the use of interest rate swaps  in order to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we also regularly review interest rate exposure on our outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional amount of million 
the agreement expires in november the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the first million of floating rate debt outstanding under our line of credit at a rate of per annum plus the interest rate spread on our line of credit  thus reducing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  and thus is not a measure of exposure to us 
the differences to be paid or received by us under the interest rate swap agreement are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the agreement is with a major financial institution  which is expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement

our line of credit matures in june  but may be extended at our option for an additional year 
as discussed above  our line of credit bears interest at variable rates  and therefore  cost approximates market value 
at december   the fair value of our interest rate swaps was an asset of approximately  our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our borrowings under the line of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  our interest expense would have increased by approximately  based on balances outstanding during
