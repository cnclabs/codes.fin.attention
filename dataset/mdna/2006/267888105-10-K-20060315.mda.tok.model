item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes  as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this annual report 
unless stated otherwise  all dollar figures in this discussion are presented in thousands s 
executive overview our business is organized into two segments explosive metalworking which we also refer to as dmc clad and amk welding 
in  explosive metalworking accounted for more than of our net sales and income from operations of continuing operations 
in and  explosive metalworking accounted for more than and  respectively  of our net sales  and more than and  respectively  of income from operations of continuing operations 
our net sales increased compared to  reflecting explosive metalworking year to year net sales increases in our us based and european operations of and  respectively 
our income from operations of continuing operations increased  to  in from  in  reflecting an  improvement in explosive metalworking s operating income and a improvement in amk welding s operating income 
income from continuing operations before discontinued operations increased  to  in from  in our net income increased more than three fold  to  in from  in our net income included a loss from discontinued operations of  relating to the divestiture of the spin forge division that we completed in september net sales explosive metalworking s net sales are generated principally from sales of clad metal plates and sales of transition joints  which are made from clad plates  to fabricator customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries  including upstream oil and gas  oil refinery  petrochemicals  hydrometallurgy  aluminum production  shipbuilding  power generation  industrial refrigeration and similar industries 
historically  with the exception of the large nickel hydrometallurgy project orders that we receive periodically  us demand for our clad metal products has been largely driven by plant maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing  petrochemical processing and oil refining facilities 
however  during  we saw an increase in us order inquiries relating to new plants and large plant expansion projects in the us and other parts of the world 
in contrast to the us market  historical demand for our clad products in europe and asia has been more dependent on large projects  such as the building of new pta plants in different parts of the world  including china  and on sales of electrical transition joints that are used in the aluminum smelting industry 
amk welding s net sales are generated from welding  heat treat and inspection services that are provided with respect to customer supplied parts for customers primarily involved in the power generation industry and aircraft engine markets 
a significant portion of our net sales is derived from a relatively small number of customers  therefore  the failure to complete existing contracts on a timely basis  and to receive payment for such services in a timely manner  or to enter into future contracts at projected volumes and profitability levels could adversely affect our ability to meet cash requirements exclusively through operating activities 
we attempt to minimize the risk of losing customers or specific contracts by continually improving product quality  delivering product on time and competing favorably on the basis of price 
dmc clad s business is cyclical since it is linked to its customers end market activity 
the construction cycle for new manufacturing capacity in the chemical industry has historically been quite pronounced 
it is driven both by world economic demand growth and capacity utilization 
as capacity starts to become tight for various chemicals and prices begin to rise  new manufacturing capacity is added in relatively large incremental amounts 
excess capacity drives prices down and capacity utilization drops 
this has historically been a seven to ten year cycle 
gross profit and cost of products sold cost of products sold for explosive metalworking include the cost of metals and alloys used to manufacture clad metal plates  the cost of explosives  employee compensation and benefits  freight  outside processing costs  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
amk welding s cost of products sold consists principally of employee compensation and benefits  welding supplies wire and gas  depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment  outside services and other manufacturing overhead expenses 
discontinued operations in october  we completed the sale of our pmp division  and in september  we completed the sale of our spin forge division 
the loss from the discontinued operations of pmp and spin forge decreased from  in to  in  with the loss including a net of tax loss of from the spin forge sale and the loss including a net of tax loss of from the sale of pmp 
discontinued operations included net of tax operating losses of in and  in  with the entire amount relating to spin forge and the amount including net of tax operating losses from both spin forge and pmp in the amounts of and  respectively 
income taxes our effective income tax rate increased to in from in income tax provisions on the and earnings of nobelclad and nitro metall have been provided based upon the respective french and swedish statutory tax rates 
we expect that our future effective tax rates will be higher than those experienced in and as a result of the recognition of us tax benefits relating to research and development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusions and foreign tax credits in and going forward  based upon existing tax regulations and current federal  state and foreign statutory tax rates  we expect our effective tax rate on our consolidated pre tax income to range between and 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales change percentage change net sales net sales for increased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the explosive metalworking sales increase reflects a increase in sales by our us based operations and a us dollar sales increase at nobelclad europe 
the year to year increase in worldwide explosive metalworking sales is principally attributable to the improved economic condition of the industries that this business segment serves 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
gross profit change percentage change gross profit percentage of net sales gross profit increased by to  in from  in our consolidated gross profit margin rate increased to from in the gross profit margin for explosive metalworking increased from in to in and the gross profit margin for amk welding increased to in from in the gross margin increase for explosive metalworking reflects an increase in the us gross margin rate from in to in that was accompanied by an increase in the nobelclad europe rate to in from in the gross margin improvements for both explosive metalworking and amk welding relate primarily to the sales increases discussed above and the resultant more favorable absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses 
the explosive metalworking gross margin increase also reflects higher average prices in  particularly with respect to our european operations 
general and administrative expenses change percentage change general administrative expenses percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in this increase in general and administrative expenses reflects an increase in spending by our us operations  which was partially offset by a decrease in our european general and administrative expenses 
increased spending in our us operations  which currently absorb all corporate headquarters expenses  reflects an aggregate increase of in audit  tax consulting and investor relations expenses  a increase in accrued incentive compensation expense  and the impact of annual salary adjustments 
the increases in audit  tax advisory  consulting and investor relations expenses relates primarily to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  tax planning initiatives and increased investor relations activities 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decreased percentage is attributable to the significant increase in net sales 
selling expenses change percentage change selling expenses percentage of net sales selling expenses increased by to  in from  in the increase in selling expenses reflects increases of and for our us operations and european operations  respectively 
increased european selling expenses reflect an increase in outside sales commissions paid to third party agents that represent dmc in certain countries  and is attributable to the sales increase 
as a result of the significant increase in net sales  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in income from operations of continuing operations change percentage change income from operations of continuing operations income from operations increased by to  in from  in explosive metalworking reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in this increase is largely attributable to the sales increase discussed above 
amk welding reported income from operations of in  an increase of from the that it reported in  which increase follows the sales increase 
interest expense  net change percentage change interest expense  net net interest expense decreased by to in from in this decrease in net interest expense reflects a significant decrease in average outstanding borrowings during that resulted from the pay down of bank line of credit borrowings and snpe s conversion of a million convertible subordinated note into our common stock 
income tax provision change percentage change income tax provision percentage we recorded an income tax provision of  in compared to  in the effective tax rate increased to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with the operations of nobelclad and its swedish subsidiary  nitro metall 
loss from discontinued operations change percentage change loss from discontinued operations we completed the divestiture of our spin forge division in september under the principal divestiture agreement  we sold the assets of the spin forge division to a third party  excluding certain equipment and real estate which were leased or subleased to the buyer  for a sales price of approximately  to be paid in cash according to the arrangement set forth in the divestiture agreement 
with respect to the spin forge manufacturing equipment and tooling  we recorded an after tax impairment loss of based upon the difference between the carrying value of the equipment and the present value of the future minimum equipment lease payments from the lessee plus estimated liquidation proceeds at the end of the minimum lease term 
the loss from discontinued operations of  includes a net of tax loss of from the spin forge divestiture  which reflects the asset impairment loss discussed above plus divestiture transaction costs  and the net of tax operating loss of that spin forge reported from january through september  we held a purchase option on the spin forge real estate that allowed us to purchase the real estate for  a price that was below the real estate s appraised value 
the value inherent in the real estate purchase option was believed to be significant but was not considered in the calculation of the above reported impairment loss on the spin forge equipment and tooling due to uncertainties surrounding its ultimate realization 
we completed the sale of the purchase option on the spin forge real estate in january the option rights were sold to the property owner for million 
we will record a pre tax gain of approximately million on this transaction  which will be reported in the first quarter of as part of the discontinued operations line item  net of related taxes 
we continue to own the spin forge manufacturing equipment and tooling and lease it to the third party purchaser of the spin forge business 
to the extent that this third party does not exercise its option to purchase all or a portion of the leased equipment and tooling when the lease term expires on january   we plan to immediately liquidate such equipment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales change percentage change net sales net sales for increased to  from  in explosive metalworking sales increased to  in of total sales from  in of total sales 
the explosive metalworking sales increase reflects a increase in us sales and a smaller us dollar sales increase at nobelclad europe 
the nobelclad europe sales increase of approximately million includes a sales volume increase of approximately million and a favorable foreign exchange translation adjustment of approximately million relating to the decline in the value of the us dollar against the euro 
the large year to year increase in worldwide explosive metalworking sales is principally attributable to the improved economic condition of the industries that we serve 
amk welding contributed  to sales of total sales versus sales of  in of total sales 
the relatively flat sales at amk welding were expected as amk welding was waiting for a customer to transition a new ground based turbine system from development into production 
gross profit change percentage change gross profit percentage of net sales gross profit for increased by to  from  in our consolidated gross profit margin rate of was the same as that for the gross profit margin for explosive metalworking increased from in to in  while the gross profit margin for amk welding decreased to in from in the gross margin increase for explosive metalworking reflects a small decrease in the us gross margin rate from in to in that was more than offset by an increase in the european gross margin rate to in from in the gross margin decline at amk welding is principally attributable to unfavorable changes in product mix as higher development work performed in on a customer s new ground turbine did not recur at the same volume levels in and was replaced by lower margin aircraft engine work 
general and administrative expenses change percentage change general administrative expenses percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in the increase in general and administrative expense includes an approximate increase in incentive compensation expense resulting from the large increase in pre tax earnings  increased tax consulting expenses of approximately relating to special tax studies that were performed during to maximize our use of available us federal income tax credits and deductions  and an increase of approximately in aggregate audit  legal and board of director fees that relates principally to the direct and indirect costs of complying with various aspects of the sarbanes oxley act of as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in this decreased percentage is attributable to the significant increase in net sales 
selling expenses change percentage change selling expenses percentage of net sales selling expenses increased by to  in from  in selling expenses for our us operations increased from  in to  in  with this increase being partially offset by a reduction in european selling expenses from  in to  in the increase in selling expenses for our us operations reflects an approximate increase in accrued bonus expense associated with the higher profitability of the us clad metal division in and increased spending in on business travel and outside consultants relating to the higher level of business activity and the pursuit of new business development opportunities 
the decline in selling expenses for our european operations relates principally to a decrease in commissions paid to third party agents that represent us in certain countries 
as a result of the significant increase in net sales  selling expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in income from operations of continuing operations change percentage change income from operations of continuing operations income from operations increased by to  in from  in explosive metalworking reported income from operations of  in as compared to  in this increase in explosive metalworking operating income is largely attributable to the sales increase discussed above 
amk welding reported income from operations of in compared to in development work performed in on a new ground based turbine did not recur at the same levels during and the absence of such higher margin work in is largely responsible for the decline in amk welding s operating income levels 
interest expense  net change percentage change interest expense  net interest expense increased by to in from in this increase in interest expense reflects an increase in average borrowings under our us bank line of credit to support the higher level of working capital required by the significant growth in production and sales levels in this increase offset a reduction in our outstanding term debt  from  at december  to  at the end of the increase in interest expense also reflects higher average interest rates in the us on our variable rate line of credit and term debt borrowings 
related party interest expense totaled and in and  respectively 
income tax provision change percentage change income tax provision percentage we recorded an income tax provision of  in on income from continuing operations as compared to an income tax provision of  in the effective tax rate decreased to in from in the and income tax provisions include  and  respectively  related to us taxes  with the remainder relating to foreign taxes associated with the operations of nobelclad and its swedish subsidiary  nitro metall 
income tax provisions on the and earnings of nobelclad and nitro metall have been provided based upon the respective french and swedish statutory tax rates 
our effective tax rate was unusually low as a result of the recognition of us tax benefits aggregating more than relating to research and development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusions and foreign tax credits 
these tax credits and income exclusions were generated from business activities and transactions that occurred in tax years prior to but were not probable and estimable until the fourth quarter of when special tax studies were completed 
the effective tax rate for was high because us taxes were provided at a rate on of intercompany dividends received in from nobelclad 
the dividend income was eliminated in our consolidated statement of operations  but us taxes were provided on such dividend income in the consolidated income tax provision without any offsetting tax credit as the recoverability of that tax credit did not meet the more likely than not test required by statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this increased the consolidated effective tax rate from an expected rate of approximately to an actual rate of 
loss from discontinued operations change percentage change loss from discontinued operations on october   we completed the sale of our pmp division 
in our financial statements  we reported the loss on the sale of pmp as well as the operating losses reported by pmp in prior years as discontinued operations  net of related tax benefits 
on september   we completed the divestiture of our spin forge division  as discussed above 
the net loss from the discontinued operations of pmp and spin forge decreased from  in to  with the net loss including a net of tax loss of from the spin forge divestiture and the net loss including a net of tax loss of from the sale of pmp 
discontinued operations included net of tax operating losses of in and  in  with the entire amount relating to spin forge and the amount including net of tax operating losses from both spin forge and pmp in the amounts of and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow  revolving credit borrowings  various long term debt arrangements and the issuance of common stock 
we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future 
nevertheless  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies  including our ability to secure new customer orders at our operating divisions  and to continue to implement cost effective internal processes 
debt and other contractual obligations and commitments any restriction on the availability of borrowing under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements 
our existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions  certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders  redemption of capital stock  incurrence of additional indebtedness  mortgaging  pledging or disposition of major assets and maintenance of specified financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of our debt agreements 
the table below presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for our debt obligations and other contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payment due by period as of december  less than more than total year years years years snpe sa line of credit term loan with french bank industrial development revenue bonds total debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total reflected in accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
expected interest payments on the above debt obligations are not expected to be significant for the years presented 
not reflected in accompany consolidated balance sheets

cash flows from operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities for totaled  significant sources of operating cash flow included net income of  non cash depreciation and amortization expense of  and  from the tax benefit related to stock options exercised during the year 
these sources of operating cash flow were partially offset by a provision for deferred income taxes of  and negative net changes in various components of working capital in the amount of  net negative changes in working capital included an increase in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid expenses of   and  respectively 
these negative changes in working capital were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of  and  respectively 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for totaled  which consisted of net cash flows from continuing operations of  that was partially offset by net cash flows used in discontinued operations of  significant sources of operating cash flow from continuing operations included income from continuing operations of  non cash depreciation and amortization expense of  a provision for deferred income taxes of  and from the tax benefit related to stock options exercised during the year 
these sources of operating cash flow were partially offset by negative net changes in various components of working capital in the amount of  net negative changes in working capital included an increase in accounts receivable and inventories of  and  respectively 
these negative changes in working capital were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and in accrued expenses and other liabilities of  and  respectively  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other of the large increases in accounts receivable and inventories reflect the higher production and sales volume associated with the strong performance of the explosive metalworking business during the last half of we were able to finance a significant portion of the build up in accounts receivable and inventories by increasing accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for was  which consisted of net cash flows provided by continuing operations of  that was partially offset by net cash flows used in discontinued operations of  sources of operating cash flow from continuing operations consisted primarily of income from continuing operations of  non cash depreciation and amortization expense of  and a provision for deferred income taxes of  net negative changes in various components of working capital totaling  partially offset the foregoing sources of operating cash flow 
negative changes in working capital included an increase in inventories of  an increase in prepaid and other of  and a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of  these negative changes in working capital were partially offset by a  decrease in accounts receivable and a increase in accounts payable 
cash flows from investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities for were  and consisted primarily of  in capital expenditures and  for investment in marketable securities that was partially offset by a  payment received on a portion of the outstanding receivable relating to the spin forge divestiture 
net cash flows used in investing activities for were and consisted primarily of  in capital expenditures that was partially offset by a reduction in the promissory note receivable relating to the sale of the pmp division  the release of in restricted cash from bond proceeds and investing activities of discontinued operations of net cash flows used in investing activities for were  and consisted primarily of in capital expenditures and used by investing activities of discontinued operations

critical accounting policies our historical consolidated financial statements and notes to our historical consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us 
in management s opinion  the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are revenue recognition  asset impairments  inventory valuation and impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  and actual results could differ from the estimates  as additional information becomes known 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition sales of clad metal products and welding services are generally based upon customer specifications set forth in customer purchase orders and require us to provide certifications relative to metals used  services performed and the results of any non destructive testing that the customer has requested be performed 
any non conformance issues are resolved before the product is shipped and billed 
revenue is recognized only when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
for contracts that require multiple shipments  revenue is recorded only for the units included in each individual shipment 
if  as a contract proceeds toward completion  projected total cost on an individual contract indicates a potential loss  we provide currently for such anticipated loss 
asset impairments we review our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in so doing  we estimate the future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
otherwise  an impairment loss is not recognized 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of  if any  are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually on reporting units one level below the segment level and any impairment is based on the reporting unit s estimated fair value 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of similar businesses 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
our policy is to test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless an indicator of impairment arises earlier 
the entire amount of goodwill  which had a carrying value of on our balance sheet as of december   relates to our us explosives metalworking segment 
based on the analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  no impairment was recorded to the carrying value of goodwill 
impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks the functional currency for our foreign operations is the applicable local currency for each affiliate company 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is the local currency are translated at exchange rates in effect at period end  and the statements of operations are translated at the average exchange rates during the period 
exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency financial statements into us dollars that result in unrealized gains or losses are referred to as translation adjustments 
cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in other cumulative comprehensive income loss 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise 
subsequent changes in exchange rates result in transaction gains and losses  which are reflected in income as unrealized based on period end translations or realized upon settlement of the transactions 
cash flows from our operations in foreign countries are translated at actual exchange rates when known  or at the average rate for the period 
as a result  amounts related to assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows will not agree to changes in the corresponding balances in the consolidated balance sheets 
the effects of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies are reported as a separate line item below cash flows from financing activities 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement base and the tax base of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine if they will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income and records a valuation allowance accordingly 
during  we completed an analysis of prior year tax credits and related items 
as a result of the analysis  we filed amended federal and state income tax returns 
the amended state returns reported additional net operating losses and credits above the amounts we had previously recorded on its books and records 
in assessing these additional losses and credits  we determined that the utilization of a portion of these was not probable  due to potential changes in the states in which we have income tax nexus 
thus  we recorded a net valuation allowance of approximately against the deferred tax assets during off balance sheet arrangements we have no obligations  assets or liabilities other than those disclosed in our financial statements forming part of this annual report  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
forward looking statements this annual report and the documents incorporated by reference into it contain certain forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigations reform act of these statements include information with respect to our financial condition and its results of operations and businesses 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  may  will  continue  project and similar expressions  as well as statements in the future tense  identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include the ability to obtain new contracts at attractive prices  the size and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in customer demand  competitive factors  the timely completion of contracts  any actions which may be taken by the majority stockholder  groupe snpe  as our controlling stockholder with respect to us and our business  the timing and size of expenditures  the timely receipt of government approvals and permits  the adequacy of local labor supplies at our facilities  the availability and cost of funds  and general economic conditions  both domestically and abroad 
the effects of these factors are difficult to predict 
new factors emerge from time to time and we cannot assess the potential impact of any such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date of this annual report and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
in addition  see risk factors for a discussion of these and other factors 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an option 
in addition  sfas r requires any excess tax benefits received upon exercise of options to be presented as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as an operating activity as it is currently presented 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method and are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations 
we have preliminarily estimated that the impact of adoption will result in a reduction in full year net earnings equal to approximately to per diluted share 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  which amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing 
this statement requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material to be excluded from inventory costing and instead included as period expenses 
in addition  this standard requires the allocation of fixed production overhead to be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
we do not believe the adoption of this standard on january  will have a significant impact on its results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which requires the direct effects of voluntary accounting principle changes to be retrospectively applied to prior periods financial statements 
this statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  but would apply in the unusual instance that a pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
maintains existing guidance with respect to accounting estimate changes and corrections of errors 
the statement is effective for us beginning on january  adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  primarily debt obligations 
since most of our obligations carry variable interest rates  there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of those obligations 
as of december  dollars in thousands snpe sa line of credit variable rate interest rate term loan with french bank variable rate interest rate industrial development revenue bonds variable rate interest rate the functional currencies for the foreign operations of nobelclad and nitro metall are the euro and the swedish krona  respectively 
thus  the major foreign exchange risks relates to the euro swedish krona and euro us dollar conversion rates 
additionally  we occasionally enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency  which exposes us to other foreign exchange risks 
sales made in currencies other than us dollars accounted for  and of total sales for the years ended  and  respectively
