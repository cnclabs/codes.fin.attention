item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the goodyear tire rubber company is one of the world s leading manufacturers of tires and rubber products with one of the most recognizable brand names in the world 
we have a broad global footprint with manufacturing facilities in countries 
we operate our business through six operating segments north american tire  european union tire  eastern europe  middle east and africa tire eastern europe tire  latin american tire  asia pacific tire  and engineered products 
since we have been implementing a turnaround strategy aimed at cost reductions  productivity improvements  capital structure improvements and new product developments 
throughout we continued to make progress on this strategy 
in we recorded net income of million compared to net income of million in the comparable period of in addition  in our total segment operating income increased to nearly billion from million in  reflecting an increase in segment operating income in all five of our tire segments 
total segment operating margin also improved to in from in see results of operations segment information for additional information 
although segment operating margin in north american tire also improved in to from in  segment operating margin for north american tire continues to lag behind that of our other tire segments 
the improvement was driven by our strategy to focus on the higher value replacement market and being more selective in the oe market  strong performance of high performance and premium branded tires  our ability to recover higher raw material costs through pricing actions and the results of our cost reduction programs 
to extend and enhance our turnaround strategy  in september we announced additional cost reduction initiatives we plan to implement over the next several years 
the initiatives include reducing our high cost manufacturing capacity by between percent and percent resulting in anticipated annual savings of between million and million 
in connection with the reduction in manufacturing capacity  we anticipate incurring cash restructuring charges of approximately million to million over the next three years 
in  we continued our transformation to a market driven  consumer focused company with the introduction in north america of the fortera featuring tripletred technology  a premium suv tire incorporating the same technology we introduced with the successful launch of our assurance line of tires in in europe  we introduced two new high performance winter tires  the goodyear ultra grip and dunlop sp winter sport d  both of which have received highly favorable consumer reviews 
we also continued to make progress on our capital structure improvement plan in with the completion of three asset dispositions i the sale of our indonesian natural rubber plantation at a sale price of approximately million  ii the sale of our wingtack adhesive resin business in which we received approximately million in cash and retained about million in working capital  and iii the sale of the assets of our north american farm tire business to titan international for approximately million 
we also announced that we are exploring the possible sale of our engineered products business 
we also successfully lengthened a significant portion of our debt maturities with the refinancing of our primary credit facilities in april while these and other activities have improved our liquidity position  we continue to review potential divestitures of other non core assets and other financing options  including the issuance of additional equity 
as a result of our focus on the higher margin replacement products  in we estimate that we had a slight increase in share of sales of replacement tires compared to in the oe market we estimate that our share of sales increased primarily as a result of gains in our international markets 
in  we estimate that industry volume for oe and replacement tires in the european union will be flat 
in north america  we estimate volume growth of about for commercial oe tires and a slight decrease in volume for consumer oe tires 
we also anticipate approximately of growth in industry volume in both consumer and commercial replacement tires 

table of contents while our operating results continued to improve in  we continue to face several challenges  including rising raw material costs for the full year raw material costs increased approximately compared to  currency fluctuations  increasing competition from low cost manufacturers  a high level of debt and significant pension funding requirements  including domestic pension funding obligations in of as much as million 
subject to the outcome of pending legislation  our domestic pension obligations are expected to peak in however  we anticipate being subject to significant required pension funding obligations in and beyond 
our ability to successfully implement our turnaround strategy will depend  in large part  on our ability to address and manage these challenges 
in the fourth quarter of  our segment operating income declined slightly compared to the prior year 
this reduction was primarily due to the impact of the hurricanes  higher than expected raw material costs and production adjustments to reduce tire inventories  particularly in europe and latin america 
in the fall of  we implemented temporary reductions in production at our north american tire facilities due to disruptions in the supply of certain raw materials resulting from the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 
the hurricanes had an adverse impact of approximately million on our results of operations in million of which related to the fourth quarter primarily reflecting the unabsorbed fixed costs related to the temporary closures of our chemical plants on the texas gulf coast and production cuts at our north american tire plants as well as the impairment of certain assets  and loss of inventories 
out of period adjustments totaled million in after tax income in the fourth quarter of and primarily related to income taxes 
of this amount  million relates to prior quarters of for the year ended december  we recorded approximately million in net after tax expense relating to prior periods 
we remain subject to a securities and exchange commission sec investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement of our historical financial statements 
in connection with this investigation  we received a wells notice from the staff of the sec in august the wells notice is described more fully in legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k 
also as described in item a of this form k  we remediated two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  beginning in we will be working with the united steelworkers of america usw to extend or renegotiate the master collective bargaining agreement that covers approximately  employees in the united states and expires in july the outcome of these collective bargaining negotiations cannot presently be determined 
if we are unable to reach an agreement with the usw regarding the terms of a collective bargaining agreement  we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages that could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial positions and liquidity 
our results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be adversely affected in future periods by loss of market share or lower demand in the replacement market or the oe industry  which would result in lower levels of plant utilization and an increase in unit costs 
also  we could experience higher raw material and energy costs in future periods 
these costs  if incurred  may not be recoverable due to pricing pressures present in today s highly competitive market and we may not be able to continue improving our product mix 
our future results of operations are also dependent on our ability to i successfully implement cost reduction programs to address  among other things  higher wage and benefit costs  and ii where necessary  reduce excess manufacturing capacity 
we are unable to predict future currency fluctuations 
sales and earnings in future periods would be unfavorably impacted if the us dollar strengthens against various foreign currencies  or if economic conditions deteriorate in the economies in which we operate 
continued volatile economic conditions or changes in government policies in emerging markets could adversely affect sales and earnings in future periods 
we may also be impacted by economic disruptions associated with global events including natural disasters  war  acts of terror and civil obstructions

these costs decreased million and million  respectively from levels 
in addition  rationalization activities decreased sag by million

these adjustments related primarily to the release of certain foreign valuation allowances for and primarily for the settlement of prior years tax liabilities in the american job creation act of the act was signed into law in october and replaces an export incentive with a deduction from domestic manufacturing income 
as we are both an exporter and a domestic manufacturer and in a us tax loss position  this change did not have a material impact on our income tax provision for it also provided for a special one time tax deduction of of certain foreign earnings that were repatriated no later than we evaluated the effects of this provision in light of our us loss position and determined not to repatriate under the provisions of the act as it would not provide a tax benefit to us 

table of contents the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is probable that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
as of december   we had not recognized tax benefits of approximately million million net of minority interest in net income of subsidiaries relating to the reorganization of certain legal entities in  which is the subject of a tax examination that could be settled in pursuant to the reorganization  our tax payments have been reduced by approximately million through december  should the ultimate outcome be unfavorable  we would be required to make a cash payment  with interest  for all tax benefits claimed as of that date

rationalization activity to maintain global competitiveness  we have implemented rationalization actions over the past several years for the purpose of reducing excess capacity  eliminating redundancies and reducing costs 
we recorded net rationalization costs of million in and million in rationalization charges in consisted of manufacturing associate reductions  retail store reductions  it associate reductions  and a sales function reorganization in european union tire  manufacturing and administrative associate reductions in eastern europe tire  sales  marketing  and research and development associate reductions in engineered products  and manufacturing and corporate support group associate reductions in north american tire

general in  we estimate savings of approximately million approximately million in cgs and approximately million in sag for plans initiated in the savings realized in for the plans totaled approximately million 
we estimate that cgs and sag were reduced in by approximately million and million  respectively  as a result of the implementation of the plans 
savings related to rationalization activities did not achieve expected levels primarily due to plan changes and implementation delays

the commercial user should apply the provisions of sfas and fin fsp shall be applied the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the date of the adoption of the law by the applicable eu member country 
we adopted the fsp at certain of our european operations where applicable legislation was adopted 
the impact of the adoption on the consolidated financial statements was not significant 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include general and product liability and other litigation  workers compensation  recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  based on currently available information 
changes in facts and circumstances may alter such estimates and affect results of operations and financial position in future periods 
general and product liability and other litigation 
general and product liability and other recorded litigation liabilities are recorded based on management s analysis that a loss arising from these matters is probable 
if the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record the amount of the estimated loss 
if the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more probable than another  we record the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
loss ranges are based upon the specific facts of each claim or class of claim and were determined after review by counsel 
court rulings on our cases or similar cases could impact our assessment of the probability and estimate of our loss  which could have an impact on our reported results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we record insurance recovery receivables related to our litigation claims when it is probable we will receive reimbursement from the insurer 
specifically  we are a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging various asbestos related personal injuries purported to result from alleged exposure to asbestos in certain rubber encapsulated products or aircraft braking systems manufactured by us in the past  or in certain of our facilities 
typically  these lawsuits have been brought against multiple defendants in state and federal courts 
we engage an independent asbestos valuation firm to review our existing reserves for pending claims  provide a reasonable estimate of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims  and determine our receivables from probable insurance recoveries 

table of contents a significant assumption in our estimated liability is that it represents our estimated liability through  which represents the period over which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulties in making these estimates  analysis based on new data and or changed circumstances arising in the future could result in an increase in the recorded obligation in an amount that cannot be reasonably estimated  and that increase could be significant 
we had recorded liabilities for both asserted and unasserted claims  inclusive of defense costs  totaling million at december  and million at december  the portion of the liability associated with unasserted asbestos claims and related defense costs was million at december  and million at december  at december   our liability with respect to asserted claims and related defense costs was million  compared to million at december  we maintain primary insurance coverage under coverage in place agreements as well as excess liability insurance with respect to asbestos liabilities 
we record a receivable with respect to such policies when we determine that recovery is probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of a particular recovery 
this determination is based on consultation with our outside legal counsel and giving consideration to relevant factors  including the ongoing legal proceedings with certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers  their financial viability  their legal obligations and other pertinent facts 
the valuation firm also assisted us in valuing receivables recorded for probable insurance recoveries 
based upon the model employed by the valuation firm  as of december   i we had recorded a receivable related to asbestos claims of million  compared to million at december   and ii we expect that approximately of asbestos claim related losses would be recoverable up to our accessible policy limits 
the receivable recorded consists of an amount we expect to collect under coverage in place agreements with certain primary carriers as well as an amount we believe is probable of recovery from certain of our excess coverage insurance carriers 
of this amount  million was included in current assets as part of accounts and notes receivable at december  and in addition to our asbestos claims  we are a defendant in various lawsuits related to our entran ii rubber hose product 
during  we entered into a settlement agreement to address a substantial portion of our entran ii liabilities 
the claims associated with the plaintiffs that opted not to participate in the settlement will be evaluated in a manner consistent with our other litigation claims 
we had recorded liabilities related to entran ii claims totaling million at december  and million at december  workers compensation 
we recorded liabilities  on a discounted basis  totaling million and million for anticipated costs related to workers compensation at december  and  respectively 
the costs include an estimate of expected settlements on pending claims  defense costs and a provision for claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates are based on our assessment of potential liability using an analysis of available information with respect to pending claims  historical experience  and current cost trends 
the amount of our ultimate liability in respect of these matters may differ from these estimates 
we periodically update our loss development factors based on actuarial analyses 
at december   the liability was discounted using the risk free rate of return 
for further information on general and product liability and other litigation  environmental matters and workers compensation  refer to the note to the consolidated financial statements no 
 commitments and contingencies 
recovery of goodwill and other intangible assets 
generally accepted accounting principles do not permit goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be amortized 
rather  these assets must be tested annually for impairment 
the impairment testing would have to be performed more frequently than on an annual basis as a result of the occurrence of a potential indicator of impairment 
for purposes of our annual impairment testing  which is conducted during the third quarter each year  we determine the estimated fair values of our reporting units using a valuation methodology based upon an ebitda multiple using comparable companies in the global automotive industry sector 
the ebitda multiple is adjusted if necessary to reflect local market conditions and recent transactions 
the ebitda of the reporting units are adjusted to exclude certain non recurring or unusual items and corporate charges 

table of contents ebitda is based upon a combination of historical and forecasted results 
significant decreases in ebitda in future periods could be an indication of a potential impairment 
additionally  valuation multiples in the global automotive industry sector would have to decline in excess of to indicate a potential goodwill impairment 
goodwill totaled million and other intangible assets with indefinite lives totaled million at december  we completed our annual valuation during the third quarter of the valuation indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance and uncertain income tax positions 
at december  and  we had valuation allowances aggregating billion against all of our net federal and state and some of our foreign net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our losses in the us  and certain foreign locations in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net federal  state and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets under sfas we intend to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support realization of such assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we also recognize tax benefits to the extent that it is probable that our positions will be sustained when challenged by the taxing authorities 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities  our effective tax rate in a given period could be materially affected

pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our recorded liability for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions is based on a number of assumptions  including life expectancies  retirement rates  discount rates  long term rates of return on plan assets  future compensation levels  future health care costs  and maximum company covered benefit costs 
certain of these assumptions are determined with the assistance of outside actuaries 
assumptions about life expectancies  retirement rates  future compensation levels and future health care costs are based on past experience and anticipated future trends  including an assumption about inflation 
the discount rate for our us plans is derived from a portfolio of corporate bonds from issuers rated aa or higher by standard poor s as of december and is reviewed annually 
the total cash flows provided by the portfolio are similar to the timing of our expected benefit payment cash flows 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is based on the compound annualized return of our us pension fund over periods of years or more  asset class return expectations and long term inflation 
these assumptions are regularly reviewed and revised when appropriate  and changes in one or more of them could affect the amount of our recorded net expenses for these benefits 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
if the actual experience differs from expectations  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity in future periods could be affected 

table of contents the discount rate used in determining the total liability for our us pension and postretirement plans was at december   compared to at december  and for december  the decrease in the rate was due primarily to lower interest rates on long term highly rated corporate bonds 
as a result  interest cost included in our net periodic pension cost decreased to million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost included in our worldwide net periodic postretirement benefit cost was million in  compared to million in and million in interest cost was lower in as a result of the reduction in the postretirement liability due to medicare part d 
the weighted average remaining service period for employees covered by our us plans is approximately years

the actual rate of return on our us pension fund was  and in  and  respectively  as compared to the expected rate of return of 
this decline in us discount rates also produced a large portion of the unrecognized actuarial loss of million in our worldwide postretirement plans as of december  the unrecognized actuarial loss decreased from primarily due to a gain from the recognition of medicare part d 
for purposes of determining worldwide net periodic postretirement cost  we recognized million of the unrecognized actuarial loss in we will recognize approximately million of unrecognized actuarial losses in if our future experience is consistent with our assumptions as of december   actuarial loss recognition will gradually decline from the levels

our failure to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facilities could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
accordingly  we believe that the presentation of consolidated ebitda will provide investors with information needed to assess our ability to continue to comply with these covenants 

table of contents the following table presents the calculation of ebitda and consolidated ebitda for the periods indicated 
other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently than we do 
certain line items are presented as defined in the primary credit facilities and do not reflect amounts as presented in the consolidated statements of operations

international accounts receivable securitization facilities on balance sheet on december   gdte and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new five year pan european accounts receivable securitization facility 
the facility provides million of funding and is subject to customary annual renewal of back up liquidity lines 
as of december   the amount available and fully utilized under this program was million compared to million as of december  in addition to the pan european accounts receivable securitization facility discussed above  spt and other subsidiaries in australia have accounts receivable programs totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively 
international accounts receivable securitization facilities off balance sheet various international subsidiaries sold certain of their trade receivables under off balance sheet programs during and the receivable financing programs of these international subsidiaries did not utilize an spe 
at december  and  the value in us dollars available to and utilized by these international subsidiaries was million and million  respectively 

table of contents registration obligations we are a party to three registration rights agreements in connection with the following transactions i the march issuance of million of senior secured notes due consisting of million of senior secured notes and million of senior secured floating rate notes  ii the july issuance of million of convertible senior notes due  and iii the june issuance of million of senior notes due the registration rights agreement for the convertible notes required us to pay additional interest to investors since we did not file a registration statement to register the convertible notes by november  additional interest was paid to investors at a rate of per year for the first days following november  and per year thereafter  until december   when a registration statement on form s registering the convertible notes was declared effective 
following the effectiveness of the registration statement  the additional interest ceased to accrue on the convertible notes 
on december   we completed an exchange offer related to the million of senior secured notes due in and million of senior secured floating rate notes due in the registration rights agreement with respect to these notes required us to pay additional interest to investors since a registered exchange offer was not completed by december  the additional interest payable to investors increased in increments and reached a maximum of per year immediately prior to the completion of the exchange offer 
following the completion of the exchange offer  the additional interest of on the notes ceased to accrue and  pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement  additional interest of per year began to accrue on the notes and will continue to accrue until payment in full of the principal amount of the notes 
on january   we completed an exchange offer related to the million of senior notes due in credit ratings our credit ratings as of the date of this report are presented below s p moody s billion first lien credit facility bb ba billion second lien term loan facility b b million third lien secured term loan facility b b european facilities b b million senior secured notes due b b corporate rating implied b b senior unsecured debt b outlook stable stable although we do not request ratings from fitch  the rating agency rates our secured debt facilities ranging from b to b depending on facility and our unsecured debt ccc 
as a result of these ratings and other related events  we believe that our access to capital markets may be limited 
unless our debt credit ratings and operating performance improve  our access to the credit markets in the future may be limited 
moreover  a reduction in our credit ratings would further increase the cost of any financing initiatives we may pursue 
a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency  and is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
any rating can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change 

table of contents potential future financings in addition to our previous financing activities  we plan to undertake additional financing actions in the capital markets in order to ensure that our future liquidity requirements are addressed 
these actions may include the issuance of additional equity 
because of our debt ratings  operating performance over the past few years and other factors  access to the capital markets cannot be assured 
our ongoing ability to access the capital markets is also dependent on the degree of success we have implementing our north american tire turnaround strategy 
successful implementation of the turnaround strategy is also crucial to ensuring that we have sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations 
while we have made progress in implementing the turnaround strategy  there is no assurance that our progress will continue  or that we will be able to sustain any future progress to a degree sufficient to maintain access to capital markets and meet liquidity requirements 
as a result  failure to complete the turnaround strategy successfully could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
future liquidity requirements also may make it necessary for us to incur additional debt 
however  a substantial portion of our assets is already subject to liens securing our indebtedness 
as a result  we are limited in our ability to pledge our remaining assets as security for additional secured indebtedness 
in addition  no assurance can be given as to our ability to raise additional unsecured debt 
dividends on february   we announced that we eliminated our quarterly cash dividend 
the dividend reduction was approved by the board of directors in order to conserve cash 
under our primary credit facilities we are permitted to pay dividends on our common stock of million or less in any fiscal year 
this limit increases to million in any fiscal year if moody s senior implied rating and standard poor s s p corporate rating improve to ba or better and bb or better  respectively 
asset dispositions in  we completed the sale of our natural rubber plantation in indonesia at a sales price of approximately million 
we also completed the sale of our wingtack adhesive resins business to sartomer company  inc in we received approximately million in cash proceeds and retained approximately million in working capital in connection with the wingtack sale 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a gain of approximately million on the sale 
we may also receive additional consideration over the next three years million per year  million aggregate based on future operating performance of the wingtack business 
in we also completed the sale of assets of our north american farm tire business to titan international for approximately million 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a loss of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  primarily related to pension and retiree medical costs 
also  we have announced that we are exploring the possible sale of our engineered products business 
engineered products manufactures and markets engineered rubber products for industrial  military  consumer and transportation oe end users 
we continue to evaluate our portfolio of businesses and  where appropriate  may pursue additional dispositions of non core assets

table of contents commitments and contingent liabilities contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of december  payment due by period as of december  after total st year nd year rd year th year th year years in millions long term debt capital lease obligations interest payments operating leases pension benefits other post retirement benefits workers compensation binding commitments long term debt payments include notes payable and reflect long term debt maturities as of december  the present value of capital lease obligations is million 
these amounts represent future interest payments related to our existing debt obligations based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements 
payments related to variable debt are based on the six month libor rate at december  plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented 
the amounts provided relate only to existing debt obligations and do not assume the refinancing or replacement of such debt 
operating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of million  million  million  million  million  and million in each of the periods above  respectively  for a total of million 
payments  net of minimum sublease rentals  total  million 
the present value of the net operating lease payments is million 
the operating leases relate to  among other things  computers and office equipment  real estate and miscellaneous other assets 
no asset is leased from any related party 
the obligation related to pension benefits is actuarially determined and is reflective of obligations as of december  although subject to change  the amount set forth in the table represents the midpoint of our estimated minimum funding requirements in for domestic defined benefit pension plans under current erisa law  and the midpoint of our expected contributions to our funded non us pension plans in the expected contributions are based upon a number of assumptions  including  an erisa liability interest rate of for at the end of  the interest relief rate measures used for pension funding calculations expired 
since new legislation has not yet been enacted  the interest rate has reverted to a year us treasury bond basis beginning in under this basis  we estimate that we will be required to contribute approximately million to million to our domestic pension plans in  as reflected in the table above 
if new legislation is enacted in  we expect the interest rate used for will be based on a corporate bond basis 
using an estimate of these rates would result in estimated us contributions during in the range of million to million 
we are not able to reasonably estimate our 
table of contents future required contributions beyond due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans  including interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns  what  if any  changes may occur in pending pension funding legislation  and how contributions in excess of the minimum requirements could impact the amounts and timing of future contributions 
subject to the outcome of pending legislation  our domestic pension obligations are expected to peak in however  we anticipate being subject to significant required pension funding obligations in and beyond 
the payments presented above are expected payments for the next years 
the payments for other postretirement benefits reflect the estimated benefit payments of the plans using the provisions currently in effect 
under the relevant summary plan descriptions or plan documents we have the right to modify or terminate the plans 
the obligation related to other postretirement benefits is actuarially determined on an annual basis 
the estimated payments have been reduced to reflect the provisions of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the payments for workers compensation obligations are based upon recent historical payment patterns on claims 
the present value of anticipated claims payments for workers compensation is million 
binding commitments are for our normal operations and are related primarily to obligations to acquire land  buildings and equipment 
in addition  binding commitments includes obligations to purchase raw materials through short term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
additional other long term liabilities include items such as income taxes  general and product liabilities  environmental liabilities and miscellaneous other long term liabilities 
these other liabilities are not contractual obligations by nature 
we cannot  with any degree of reliability  determine the years in which these liabilities might ultimately be settled 
accordingly  these other long term liabilities are not included in the above table 
in addition  the following contingent contractual obligations  the amounts of which cannot be estimated  are not included in the table above the terms and conditions of our global alliance with sumitomo as set forth in the umbrella agreement between sumitomo and us provide for certain minority exit rights available to sumitomo commencing in in addition  the occurrence of certain other events enumerated in the umbrella agreement  including certain bankruptcy events or changes in control of us  could trigger a right of sumitomo to require us to purchase these interests immediately 
sumitomo s exit rights  in the unlikely event of exercise  could require us to make a substantial payment to acquire sumitomo s interest in the alliance 
pursuant to certain long term agreements  we shall purchase minimum amounts of a raw material at an agreed upon base price that is subject to quarterly adjustments for changes in raw material costs  natural gas costs  and market price adjustments 
we do not engage in the trading of commodity contracts or any related derivative contracts 
we generally purchase raw materials and energy through short term  intermediate and long term supply contracts at fixed prices or at formula prices related to market prices or negotiated prices 
we may  however  from time to time  enter into contracts to hedge our energy costs

forward looking information safe harbor statement certain information set forth herein other than historical data and information may constitute forward looking statements regarding events and trends that may affect our future operating results and financial position 
the words estimate  expect  intend and project  as well as other words or expressions of similar meaning  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this form k 
such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions  are inherently uncertain  are subject to risks and should be viewed with caution 
actual results and experience may differ materially from the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including although we recorded net income in and  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve or sustain future profitability 
our future profitability is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to continue to successfully implement our turnaround strategy for our north american tire segment  we face significant global competition  increasingly from lower cost manufacturers  and our market share could decline  our pension plans are significantly underfunded and our required contributions to those plans are substantial 
proposed us legislation affecting pension plan funding could result in the need for additional cash payments by us into our us pension plans and increase the insurance premiums we pay to the pension benefit guaranty corporation  higher raw material and energy costs may materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  continued pricing pressures from vehicle manufacturers may materially adversely affect our business  our financial position  results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected if we experience a labor strike  work stoppage or other similar difficulty

we will not revise or update any forward looking statement or disclose any facts  events or circumstances that occur after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we continuously monitor our fixed and floating rate debt mix 
within defined limitations  we manage the mix using refinancing and unleveraged interest rate swaps 
we will enter into fixed and floating interest rate swaps to alter our exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during 
table of contents periods of rising interest rates  and are normally designated as cash flow hedges 
floating rate swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long term borrowings into short term variable rates  and are normally designated as fair value hedges 
interest rate swap contracts are thus used to separate interest rate risk management from debt funding decisions 
at december   the interest rates on of our debt were fixed by either the nature of the obligation or through the interest rate swap contracts  compared to at december  we also have from time to time entered into interest rate lock contracts to hedge the risk free component of anticipated debt issuances 
as a result of credit ratings actions and other related events  our access to these instruments may be limited

the sensitivity of our interest rate contracts and fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates was determined 
table of contents with a valuation model based upon net modified duration analysis 
the model assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the precision of the model decreases as the assumed change in interest rates increases 
foreign currency exchange risk we enter into foreign currency contracts in order to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows 
these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  firm commitments and forecasted transactions resulting primarily from trade receivables and payables  equipment acquisitions  intercompany loans and royalty agreements and forecasted purchases and sales 
in addition  the principal and interest on our swiss franc bonds due is hedged by currency swap agreements  as were million of the euro notes until they matured in june contracts hedging the swiss franc bonds are designated as cash flow hedges  as were contracts hedging million of the euro notes until they matured in june contracts hedging short term trade receivables and payables normally have no hedging designation
