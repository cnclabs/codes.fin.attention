the following should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
overview we are a leading operator of full service specialty sporting goods stores in california  nevada and arizona 
in  norbert olberz  our chairman emeritus and founder the founder  purchased a small ski and tennis shop in la ca ada  california 
a focus on providing quality merchandise with outstanding customer service was the foundation of norbert s vision 
we continue this tradition and are focused on growth through a number of initiatives  including continuing new store development  remodeling stores to conform to our prototype  and improving information systems to increase product flow through  improve in stock positions and optimize merchandise assortment 
our growth strategy had historically focused on southern california  but now includes opening new stores throughout california  nevada and arizona as suitable locations are found 
we have opened twelve stores in the last three years and seventeen in the last five years 
future store openings are subject to availability of satisfactory store locations based on local competitive conditions  site availability and cost and our ability to provide and maintain high service levels and quality brand merchandising at competitive prices 
store openings are expected to have a favorable impact on sales volume  but will negatively affect profit in the short term 
new stores tend to have higher costs in the early years of operation  due primarily to increased promotional costs and lower sales on a per employee basis until the store matures 
as the store matures  sales tend to level off and expenses decline as a percentage of sales 
our stores generally require three to four years to attract a stable  mature customer base 
our prototype stores range in size from  to  square feet and showcase each product category with the feel of a specialty shop all contained under one roof 
the full service approach to customer service and product knowledge is enhanced by fixtures which feature specific categories  and give the customer an enhanced shopping experience 
mature stores are evaluated for remodel based on each store s age and competitive situation  as well as how much the landlord will contribute to our required improvements 
future store remodeling plans will depend upon several factors  including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  competition trends and the availability of adequate capital 
we believe that the overall growth of our business will allow us to maintain or increase our operating margins 
increased merchandise volumes should enable us to improve our purchasing leverage and achieve greater support throughout the supply chain 
gross profit as a percent of sales has increased from to over the past five years 
our overall growth should leverage our investments in infrastructure such as the distribution center  integration of corporate facilities into a single location  e replenishment system  highjump warehouse management software and marketmax planning and allocation technology 
however  these increased efficiencies and improvements in logistics are partially offset by the operating costs of new and maturing stores 
selling  general and administrative 
table of contents expenses  excluding the cost of the recapitalization plan during fiscal  as a percent of sales have increased from to over the past five years 
in september  our stockholders approved a recapitalization plan designed to facilitate the orderly transition of control from our founder to certain members of management and to increase financial flexibility for the company and its stockholders 
the recapitalization plan consisted of the reclassification of each outstanding share of common stock as share of class b common stock  the issuance of seven shares of class a common stock for each outstanding share of class b common stock and the transfer of a portion of the founder s ownership to craig levra  chairman and chief executive officer  and howard kaminsky  executive vice president finance  chief financial officer and secretary 
the recapitalization doubled our total number of shares outstanding 
therefore  the recapitalization plan had the same effect on earnings per share as a for stock split 
shares transferred by the founder to messrs 
levra and kaminsky were treated as a contribution to the company s capital with the offsetting charge as compensation expense 
as a result  the company recorded a one time charge based on the stock price at the time of the transfer of approximately million 
see item business recapitalization plan 
we are in the process of implementing section of the sarbanes oxley act of which requires an extensive review and likely remediation of our internal controls 
to help meet the requirements of section and enhance the company s ability to grow we are considering replacing our legacy merchandise and financial systems 
implementation of these new systems as well as the other work required by section will be expensive  time consuming and will require significant attention of management 
current rules require our compliance by march  beginning april   our fiscal year end will change from march to the sunday closest to march each fiscal year will consist of four week quarters  with an extra week added onto the fourth quarter every five to six years

liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory  store expansion  relocation and remodeling 
historically  cash from operations  credit terms from vendors and bank borrowing have met our liquidity needs 
we believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by operating activities of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  and increases in accounts payable offset by inventory purchases 
for fiscal net income also was impacted by a non cash charge of million from stock compensation related to the recapitalization plan 
typically  inventory levels increase from year to year due to the addition of new stores 
inventories increased million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  primarily from the addition of four stores  five stores and three stores  respectively  partially offset by improvements in inventory management 
in fiscal  average inventory per store decreased compared to fiscal as late winter snowfall resulted in a greater than expected sell through of winter related products 
historically  accounts payable increases as inventory increases 
however  the timing of vendor payments or receipt of merchandise near the end of the fiscal year does influence this relationship 
for fiscal  accounts payable decreased million while inventory increased million  as the result of an overstock situation which occurred during our quarter ended december  the inventory on hand at december  reduced the need for purchases in our fourth quarter and as a result caused accounts payable to decrease 
other accrued expenses increased by million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  primarily from sales tax and other expenses related to the increase in sales during the fourth quarter 
deferred rent increased million and million for fiscal and  respectively as we received large landlord reimbursements for improvements made to new stores 
the landlord reimbursement varies based on our participation in the construction of a new store 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  primarily for capital expenditures as shown below  in thousands year ended march  new stores remodels existing stores information systems rental equipment other total we have continued to open new stores  four in fiscal  five in fiscal and three in fiscal net of landlord reimbursement  the average amount spent is million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
we are also remodeling mature stores  four stores 
table of contents were remodeled in fiscal and two in each of fiscal and information systems are being upgraded with the addition of merchandise planning and allocation software and an upgrade to our store systems during fiscal as a result of our ongoing growth and strategic initiatives  forecasted capital expenditures for fiscal  are expected to be approximately million  which will be funded by cash flow from operations and our bank credit line  as needed 
approximately million of this amount will be used to open five new stores 
in addition  two stores are planned to be remodeled for approximately million 
the remainder is primarily for expenditures on information systems the most significant portion of which is for the replacement of our legacy merchandise and financial systems 
net cash provided by financing activities reflects advances and repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of march    and  we had no outstanding borrowings on this facility 
our amended credit facility with bank of america  na the lender provides for advances up to million  increasing to million for the period october  through december  each year  less the amount of any outstanding draws  up to a million maximum in authorized letters of credit 
interest accrues at the lender s prime rate at march  or can be fixed for a period of time at the then current rate established under one of several indices  all at our option 
in addition  there is an unused commitment fee of 
per year  based on a weighted average formula 
this credit facility expires on september   and we expect to renegotiate and extend the term of this agreement or obtain another form of financing before that date 
our obligation to the lender is presently secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our non real estate assets  and we are subject to several restrictive covenants 
the principal operating covenants require us to maintain certain minimum cash flow coverage and debt to equity ratios and restrict the level of capital expenditures  calculated on a quarterly basis 
we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
we believe our credit line with the lender is sufficient to fund capital expenditures for the foreseeable future and to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements 
however  unexpected conditions could require us to request additional borrowing capacity from the lender or alter our expansion plans or operations 
our primary contractual obligations and commitments as of march   are store leases with initial terms expiring from through  which typically provide for multiple five year renewal options  and employment contracts operating employment payments due by period leases contracts within year years years after years total we lease all of our existing store locations 
the leases for most of the existing stores are for approximately ten year terms with multiple option periods under non cancelable operating leases with scheduled rent increases 
the leases provide for contingent rent based upon a percentage of sales in excess of specified minimums 
if there are any free rent periods  they are accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term  beginning on the date of initial possession  which is generally when we enter the space and begin the construction build out 
the amount of the excess of straight line rent expense over scheduled payments is recorded as a deferred rent liability 
construction allowances and other such lease incentives are recorded as deferred credits  and are amortized on a straight line basis as a reduction of rent expense over the lease term 
generally  our purchase obligations are cancelable days prior to shipment from our vendors 
letters of credit amounting to approximately million relating to purchase commitments were outstanding as of march  and expire within one year 
no cash dividends have been declared on class a common stock and class b common stock in fiscal we intend to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and  therefore  do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing the financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments which affect the results of our operations and the reported value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following summarizes critical accounting policies which require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out fifo basis determined by the retail method of accounting or market 
we consider cost to include direct cost of merchandise and inbound freight  plus internal costs associated with merchandise procurement  storage and handling 
the retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail method  cost is determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio across groupings of similar items  known as departments 
as a result  the retail method results in an averaging of inventory costs across similar items within a department 
the cost to retail ratio is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis 
current owned retail represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a regular basis reduced for any permanent or clearance markdowns 
as a result  the retail method normally results in an inventory valuation that is lower than a traditional fifo cost basis 
inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including initial mark up  markdowns and shrinkage  which can significantly impact the owned retail and  therefore  the ending inventory valuation at cost 
specifically  the failure to take permanent or clearance markdowns on a timely basis can result in an overstatement of carrying cost under the retail method 
management believes that its application of the retail method reasonably states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review aged and excess inventories to determine if the carrying value of such inventories exceeds market value 
a reserve is recorded to reduce the carrying value to market value as necessary 
a determination of market value requires estimates and judgment based on our historical markdown experience and anticipated markdowns based on future merchandising and advertising plans  seasonal considerations  expected business trends and other factors 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized upon the purchase by customers at our retail store locations  less merchandise returned by customers 
revenue from gift cards  gift certificates and store merchandise credits is recognized at the time of redemption 
we generally accept returns up to days from the date of purchase with a sales receipt or proof of purchase 
typically refunds are in the same form of payment originally received from the customer 
we accommodate customers who do not have a receipt or proof of purchase by offering an exchange or store credit 
when available we track the original sale date with each return and provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on this historical experience 
as the reserve for merchandise returns is based on estimates  the actual returns could differ from the reserve  which could impact sales 
gift card certificate redemption 
we offer our customers the option of purchasing gift cards and  in the past  gift certificates which may be used toward the future purchase of our products 
revenue from gift cards  gift certificates and store merchandise credits the gift cards is recognized at the time of redemption 
the gift cards have no expiration dates 
we record unredeemed gift cards as a liability until the point of redemption 
our historical experience indicates that not all issued gift cards are redeemed the breakage 
based upon five years of redemption data  approximately of gift cards are redeemed within the year after issuance  and approximately are redeemed within months of the date of issuance  after which redemption activity is negligible 
accordingly  we recognize breakage as revenue by periodically decreasing the carrying value of the gift card liability by approximately of the aggregate amount 
during the fiscal year ended march  and prior periods  we recognized breakage at the time of issuance of gift cards 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we changed the method of 
table of contents accounting to recognize breakage at the time of redemption of gift cards 
the effect of the change in accounting to record breakage at the time of redemption is immaterial to our financial position and results of operations 
the revenue from breakage is included in the income statement line item net sales and amounted to approximately   and  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
self insurance 
property  general liability and workers compensation insurance coverage is self insured for various levels 
self insurance accruals include claims filed  as well as estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported based on historical trends 
projections of future loss are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claim occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from historical trends 
impairment of long lived assets 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flow to the asset carrying values 
declines in projected store cash flow could result in the impairment of assets 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the financial statements  income taxes are estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed  recognizing that future taxable income may give rise to new deferred tax assets 
to the extent that future recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance would be established 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense will be included within the tax provision in the income statement 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
based on our history of operating earnings  no valuation allowance has been recorded as of march  in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  a valuation allowance may need to be established  which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
provisions for income taxes are based on numerous factors that are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for its employee stock option plan under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 no stock option compensation is reflected in net income  as all options granted under the plan had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant and the related number of shares granted is fixed at that point in time 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the standard requires all entities to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted to employees in an amount equal to the fair value 
the new standard is effective for the next fiscal year that begins after june  on march  we accelerated the vesting of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock and  shares of class b common stock 
the purpose of accelerating the vesting of the options is to reduce the non cash compensation expense that we otherwise would be required to recognize 
the options remaining to vest will not have a material effect on net income when we implement the new standard in our first quarter ending june  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk consists primarily of borrowings under our credit facility  which bears interest at floating rates primarily libor rates 
the impact on earnings or cash flow during the next fiscal year from a change of basis points in the interest rate would not be significant
