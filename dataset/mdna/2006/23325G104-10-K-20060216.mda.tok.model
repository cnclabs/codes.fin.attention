acquisitions and other recent transactions on august   we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of the orthopedics soft goods osg business of encore medical  lp osg acquisition for approximately million  paid in cash upon closing  plus the assumption of certain liabilities aggregating approximately million 
the osg business is comprised of the manufacture and sale of orthopedic soft goods  patient safety products and pressure care products 
the osg acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair market values with the remainder classified as goodwill 
we acquired the osg business to expand our portfolio of national contracts and increase our related revenues and also to gain access to the patient safety products and pressure care products  which were not previously included in our product portfolio 
on march   we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of superior medical equipment  llc sme  a connecticut based distributor of orthopedic products and supplies  for an aggregate purchase price of up to million  of which approximately million was paid upon closing  million was paid as a final purchase price adjustment in april and million will be paid in march the remaining amount of up to million will be paid in march subject to achievement of certain operating targets 
the assets acquired from sme included tangible and intangible assets related to the distribution of orthopedic products and supplies 
the sme acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair market values with the remainder classified as goodwill 
in august  we completed construction of a new  square foot leased facility in tijuana  mexico  to replace three separate facilities we operated in the same area and to provide further opportunities to expand our mexico manufacturing operations 
in late  we moved all of our existing mexico operations to this new facility and we completed the relocation of the manufacturing of our cold therapy products and machine shop activities from vista  california to the new mexico plant 
we recorded restructuring charges of million million net of tax in related to these manufacturing moves  including primarily severance and moving costs 
on november   we acquired the bone growth stimulation device business from orthologic  which we now call our regeneration business 
following the regeneration acquisition in november  we operated the regeneration business as a stand alone division in tempe  arizona with a sales force separate from our domestic rehabilitation product sales force 
in august  we began the integration of the former regeneration sales force into our domestic rehabilitation sales organization  and we took the first steps towards integrating most of the other regeneration operations into our corporate facility in vista  california 
by the end of  we completed the integration of most of the regeneration operations except for the assembly and calibration operations which we expect to move to vista in the first quarter of following site approval of the us food and drug administration 
one of the principal objectives of the integration was to enhance the sales and distribution activities of the regeneration business to capture more of the growth opportunities in the regeneration market 
in addition  we believed the integration would enable us to reduce both costs of goods sold and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues in future periods  after the related costs of the integration had been incurred 
the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  includes restructuring charges related to the integration totaling approximately million million net of tax 
the costs of the integration were primarily severance  recruiting and training 
on january   we completed the acquisition  under an agreement originally signed on december   of the shares of newmed sas newmed for cash payments aggregating million euros approximately million  which included payment of certain debts of newmed 
certain sellers may also receive up to an additional million euros approximately million based on achievement of certain revenue targets for we also incurred certain transaction costs and other expenses in connection with the acquisition that are estimated to be approximately million 
newmed  through wholly owned subsidiaries in france and spain  operating under the trade name axmed  is engaged in the design  manufacture and sale of orthopedic rehabilitation devices including rigid knee braces and soft goods 
newmed also owns of a manufacturing subsidiary in tunisia  which provides low cost manufacturing capabilities to the axmed group 
the newmed acquisition will be accounted for in the first quarter of using the purchase method of accounting whereby the total purchase price  including transaction expenses  will be allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair market values  with the remainder classified as goodwill 
we acquired newmed to increase our revenue and improve our market share in france and spain 
we funded the cash paid on january  and our transaction expenses  with the proceeds of a million draw on our revolving line of credit 
segments prior to  we disclosed the following reportable segments  which  except for regeneration  were based on our sales channels donjoy  procare  officecare  regeneration and international 
effective  we have aggregated the donjoy  procare and officecare segments into one new segment  domestic rehabilitation 
in accordance with the aggregation criteria in sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  the historical segments have been aggregated due to changes in our management and compensation structure that focus on the results of domestic rehabilitation  taken as a whole  rather than on its separate components 
the segment data for all prior periods have been restated aggregated to conform to the new segmentation 
the following are our current reportable segments 
domestic rehabilitation consists of the sale of our rehabilitation products rigid knee braces  soft goods and pain management products in the united states through three sales channels  donjoy  procare and officecare 
through the donjoy sales channel  we sell our rehabilitation products utilizing a few of our direct sales representatives and a network of approximately independent commissioned sales representatives who are employed by approximately independent sales agents 
these sales representatives are primarily dedicated to the sale of our products to orthopedic surgeons  podiatrists  orthopedic and prosthetic centers  hospitals  surgery centers  physical therapists  athletic trainers and other healthcare professionals 
because certain of the donjoy product lines require customer education on the application and use of the product  our sales representatives are technical specialists who receive extensive training both from us and the agent and use their expertise to help fit the patient with the product and assist the orthopedic professional in choosing the appropriate product to meet the patient s needs 
after a product order is received by a sales representative  we generally ship the product directly to the orthopedic professional and pay a sales commission to the agent 
these commissions are reflected in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of income 
through the procare sales channel  which is comprised of approximately direct and independent representatives that manage over dealers focused on primary and acute facilities  we sell our rehabilitation products to national third party distributors  other regional medical supply dealers and medical product buying groups  generally at a discount from list prices 
the majority of these products are soft goods which require little or no patient education 
the distributors and dealers generally resell these products to large hospital chains  hospital buying groups  primary care networks and orthopedic physicians for use by the patients 
through the officecare sales channel  we maintain an inventory of rehabilitation products mostly soft goods on hand at orthopedic practices for immediate distribution to the patient 
for these products  we arrange billing to the patient or third party payor after the product is provided to the patient 
as of december   the officecare program was located at over physician offices throughout the united states 
we have contracts with over third party payors 
regeneration consists of the sale of our bone growth stimulation products in the united states 
our ol product is sold through a combination of the donjoy channel direct sales representatives and approximately additional sales representatives dedicated to selling our ol product  of which approximately are employed by us 
the spinalogic product is also included in this segment and was  until the end of  sold by depuy spine in the us under an exclusive sales agreement 
in january  we amended the agreement with depuy to divide the us into territories in which depuy spine has exclusive sales rights and non exclusive territories in which we are permitted to engage in our own sales efforts or retain another sales agent 
in early  the agreement was further modified to be non exclusive in all territories 
these products are sold either directly to the patient or to independent distributors 
we arrange billing to the third party payors or patients  for products sold directly to the patient 
international consists of the sale of our products in foreign countries through wholly owned subsidiaries or independent distributors 
we sell our products in over foreign countries  primarily in europe  canada  australia and japan 
set forth below is net revenues  gross profit and operating income information for our reporting segments for the years ended december in thousands 
this information excludes the impact of other expenses not allocated to segments  which are comprised of i general corporate expenses for all periods presented and ii the restructuring costs associated with the manufacturing moves in information for the regeneration segment includes operations for the period subsequent to the regeneration acquisition on november  and includes the impact of purchase accounting and related amortization of acquired intangible assets 
for the years ended december   and  regeneration income from operations was reduced by amortization of acquired intangible assets amounting to million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   domestic rehabilitation income from operations was reduced by amortization of acquired intangible assets amounting to million for acquisitions 
for the year ended december   regeneration income from operations was also reduced by restructuring charges of million related to the integration of the business operations of the segment 
domestic rehabilitation net revenues gross profit gross profit margin operating income operating income as a percent of net revenues regeneration net revenues gross profit gross profit margin operating income operating income as a percent of net revenues international net revenues gross profit gross profit margin operating income operating income as a percent of net revenues domestic sales domestic sales  including all sales of our domestic rehabilitation and regeneration segments  accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively 
international international sales accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth our international net revenues as a percentage of our total net revenues  by country for the years ended december germany canada united kingdom japan other countries total international sales the other countries category consists primarily of sales in france  denmark  belgium  italy  australia and the czech republic 
international sales are made primarily through two distinct channels independent third party distributors and through our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
through our wholly owned international subsidiaries  we sell products in euros  pounds sterling  canadian dollars and danish krones 
the us dollar equivalent of our international sales denominated in foreign currencies in  and were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries 
the us dollar equivalent of the related costs denominated in these foreign currencies were unfavorably impacted during the same periods 
in addition  the costs associated with our mexico based manufacturing operations are incurred in mexican pesos 
as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results 
occasionally we seek to reduce the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our business through hedging transactions 
at december   we had no hedging transactions in place 
our strategy our strategy is to increase revenue and profitability and enhance cash flow by strengthening our market leadership position 
our key initiatives to implement this strategy include increase our lead in the domestic rehabilitation market segment 
we believe we are the market leader in the domestic rehabilitation markets in which we compete 
we believe we will be able to continue to grow our domestic rehabilitation business segment and increase our market share further by focusing on growth initiatives related to maintaining a continuous flow of new product introductions and continuing to enhance the productivity of our sales force and optimize our distribution strategy 
our key domestic rehabilitation growth strategies include the following continue to introduce new products and product enhancements 
we have a history of developing and introducing innovative products into the marketplace  and are committed to continuing that tradition by introducing new products across our product platform 
in the year ended december   we launched new products 
we believe that product innovation through effective and focused research and development will provide a sustainable competitive advantage 
we believe we are currently a technology leader in several product categories and we intend to continue to develop next generation technologies 
expand product offerings for the spine and for foot and ankle 
according to frost sullivan  back pain is the number one cause of healthcare expenditure in the united states 
as a result  we believe that expanding our product offerings in this market represents a significant growth opportunity 
in  we launched a new compression back brace to address the spine market and we intend to add more products to address this market segment 
in addition  according to frost sullivan  the ankle braces and supports segment of the domestic rehabilitation market is approximately million in and offers us an opportunity for future growth as our current level of sales in this market segment is relatively low 
in  we launched our velocity ankle  a new rigid ankle brace 
this product has been one of our most successful new products in recent years 
we intend to further expand our foot and ankle product offerings 
for example  in early  we launched a new foot orthotic to treat subtle cavus foot 
expand our officecare channel 
our officecare channel currently includes over physician offices encompassing over  physicians 
we believe that our officecare channel serves a growing need among orthopedic practices to have a number of products readily available for immediate distribution to patients 
expanding our officecare channel also permits us to increase our weighted average selling prices  as the units sold through this channel are billed to insurance companies and other third party payors at higher prices than most of our other sales channels 
accordingly  our officecare initiatives represent an opportunity for sales growth based on increases in both unit volume and average selling prices 
we intend to expand our officecare channel into more high volume orthopedic offices  thereby increasing the number of potential customers to whom we sell our products 
in the year ended december   we added approximately new offices to our officecare channel  net of account terminations  including approximately accounts added through the sme acquisition 
maximize existing and secure additional national accounts 
we plan to capitalize on the growing practice in healthcare in which hospitals and other large healthcare providers seek to consolidate their purchasing activities to national buying groups 
contracts with these national accounts represent a significant opportunity for sales growth 
we believe that our broad range of products is well suited to the goals of these buying groups and intend to aggressively pursue these contracts 
in the year ended december   we signed four new significant national contracts  including a new three year  multi source contract with medassets supply chain systems for our soft goods products  and we renewed two other significant national contracts 
in addition  in connection with the osg acquisition  we added one new significant national contract and increased our penetration into several other national account opportunities already within our portfolio 
grow our regeneration business 
we have integrated the sales force for our ol bone growth stimulator product into our domestic rehabilitation sales organization 
we have also increased the number of regeneration sales specialists dedicated to selling our ol product 
we believe these specialists will be able to use the established relationships of our donjoy sales representatives to enhance sales of the ol product 
our distribution arrangement with depuy spine has also become non exclusive for  which permits us to sell the spinalogic product directly or through other independent sales representatives in all territories where we choose to do so 
we intend to add additional selling resources in those geographical parts of the country where sales are not meeting our expectations 
we believe that our new selling strategies for our regeneration segment will drive faster growth for this business 
expand international sales 
international sales have historically represented less than of our revenues 
although our presence outside the united states has been limited  we have successfully established direct distribution capabilities in major international markets 
we believe that sales to foreign markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity and we intend to continue to develop direct distribution capabilities in selected additional foreign markets 
we also believe we can increase our international revenues by expanding the number of our products we sell in international markets 
historically we have only sold a limited range of our products in our international markets 
in  we successfully launched an expanded range of soft goods  our cold therapy products and our bone growth stimulation products in our international segment 
pursue selective acquisitions 
we believe that acquisitions represent an attractive and efficient means to broaden our product lines  expand our geographic reach and increase our revenue 
we intend to pursue acquisition opportunities that enhance sales growth  are accretive to earnings  increase customer penetration and or provide geographic diversity 
in the year ended december   we completed the sme and osg acquisitions that meet these criteria as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
in january  we also completed the acquisition of newmed sas newmed  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  herein  which is intended to increase our international revenue in france and other parts of europe 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to contractual allowances  doubtful accounts  inventories  rebates  product returns  warranty obligations  income taxes  intangibles and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations provision for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
we maintain provisions for contractual allowances for reimbursement amounts from our third party payor customers based on negotiated contracts and historical experience for non contracted payors 
we also maintain provisions for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have contracts with certain third party payors for our third party reimbursement billings  which call for specified reductions in reimbursement of billed amounts based upon contractual reimbursement rates 
for and  we reserved for and reduced gross revenues from third party payors by between and for allowances related to these contractual reductions 
for our regeneration business  we record revenue net of actual contractual allowances and discounts from our gross prices  which are determined on a specific identification basis and amount to approximately to of our gross prices for bone growth stimulation products 
our reserve for doubtful accounts is based upon estimated losses from customers who are billed directly and the portion of third party reimbursement billings that ultimately become the financial responsibility of the end user patients 
direct billed customers represent approximately of our net accounts receivable at december   and we have historically experienced write offs of less than of these accounts receivable 
our third party reimbursement customers including insurance companies  managed care companies and certain governmental payors such as medicare include all of our officecare customers and certain other customers of our domestic rehabilitation business segment and the majority of our regeneration customers 
our third party payor customers represented approximately of our net revenue for the year ended december  and of our net accounts receivable at december   and we estimate bad debt expense to be approximately to of gross revenues from these third party reimbursement customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if third party payors were to deny claims for late filings  incomplete information or other reasons  additional provisions may be required 
historically  we relied heavily on third party billing service providers to provide information about the accounts receivable of certain of our third party payor customers  including the data utilized to determine reserves for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
in march  we completed the transition to a new third party insurance billing service provider 
based on information currently available to us  we believe we have provided adequate reserves for our third party payor accounts receivable 
if claims are denied  or amounts are otherwise not paid  in excess of our estimates  the recoverability of our net accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount 
in addition  if our third party insurance billing service provider does not perform to our expectations we may be required to increase our reserve estimates 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
we provide reserves for estimated excess or obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories on hand plus future purchase commitments and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
if future demand is less favorable than currently projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in addition  reserves for inventories on hand in our officecare locations are provided based on historical shrinkage rates of approximately 
if actual shrinkage rates differ from our estimated shrinkage rates  revisions to the reserve may be required 
we also provide reserves for newer product inventories  as appropriate  based on any minimum purchase commitments and our level of sales of the new products 
rebates 
we offer certain of our distributors rebates based on sales volume  sales growth and to reimburse the distributor for certain discounts 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebate programs based upon historical experience and estimated revenue levels 
returns and warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of returns and product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on historical trends 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our actual returns and warranty costs could differ from our estimates 
if actual product returns  failure rates  material usage or service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated return and or warranty liabilities may be required 
valuation allowance for deferred tax asset 
as of december   we have approximately million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related primarily to tax deductible goodwill arising at the date of our reorganization in and not recognized for book purposes and net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income prior to the expiration of our net operating loss carryforwards 
our management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted future taxable income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
management will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to assess any need for valuation allowances 
goodwill and other intangibles 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual review for impairment 
goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the segment or reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
at october   our goodwill was evaluated for impairment and we determined that no impairment existed at that date 
with the exception of goodwill related to our regeneration acquisition of million  we believe that the goodwill acquired through december  benefits the entire enterprise and since our reporting units share the majority of our assets  we compared the total carrying value of our consolidated net assets including goodwill to the fair value of the company 
with respect to goodwill related to our regeneration acquisition  we compared the carrying value of the goodwill related to the regeneration segment to the fair value of the regeneration segment 
at december   other intangibles were evaluated for impairment as required by sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the determination of the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the exercise of judgment 
upon initially recording certain of our other intangible assets  including the intangible assets that were acquired in connection with the regeneration acquisition  we used independent valuation firms to assist us in determining the appropriate values for these assets 
subsequently  we have used the same methodology and updated our assumptions 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily used the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry averages 
we recorded an impairment charge for certain long lived assets in as a result of certain new products not achieving anticipated revenues and estimated recovery values of assets being disposed of being less than anticipated 
the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets is exposed to future impairments if we experience future declines in operating results  if negative industry or economic trends occur or if our future performance is below our projections or estimates 
results of operations we operate our business on a manufacturing calendar  with our fiscal year always ending on december each quarter is weeks  consisting of one five week and two four week periods 
the first and fourth quarters may have more or less working days from year to year based on the days of the week on which holidays and december fall 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
set forth below are net revenues for our reporting segments in thousands years ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase increase domestic rehabilitation regeneration international consolidated net revenues net revenues in our domestic rehabilitation segment increased due to normal market growth in existing product lines  sales of new products  sales attributed to the osg acquisition  an increase in the number of units billed to third party payors  which are sold at higher average selling prices  and growth in sales related to national contracts in our procare sales channel 
we have also gained incremental revenue from the addition of approximately new officecare locations in  net of account terminations  including approximately accounts added in connection with our march sme acquisition 
net revenues in our regeneration segment increased  in part  from our sales force integration and an increased number of sales specialists selling our ol product 
sales of our spinalogic product also increased due to selling resources added in territories that became non exclusive in international net revenues increased partly due to favorable changes in exchange rates compared to the rates in effect in  an increase in the number of products we sell in international markets  incremental revenues from the osg acquisition  and the addition of our new direct sales subsidiary in the nordic countries  effective september  excluding the impact of exchange rates  local currency international revenues increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  gross profit 
set forth below is gross profit information for our reporting segments in thousands years ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase increase domestic rehabilitation regeneration international consolidated gross profit the improvement in consolidated gross profit and gross profit margin is related partly to increased revenues from the higher gross margin products sold in our regeneration segment and partly due to certain manufacturing cost reductions  offset by increased freight costs and increased expenses related to employee bonuses 
gross profit decreased as a percentage of net revenues in our domestic rehabilitation segment primarily due to increased freight costs and a change in product mix including incremental sales from the osg acquisition  which are primarily sold to third party distributors at a reduced gross margin 
the regeneration segment gross profit increased as a percentage of revenues due to increased sales volume  an increase in the proportion of unit sales sold to third party payors  which are sold at higher average selling prices  and certain cost benefits realized upon the consolidation of the regeneration product manufacturing into our facility in vista  california 
the increase in the international segment gross profit is primarily related to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates and the addition of the incremental in market gross margin from our direct sales in the nordic countries since september  operating expenses 
set forth below is operating expense information in thousands years ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase decrease increase decrease sales and marketing general and administrative research and development amortization of acquired intangibles restructuring costs consolidated operating expenses sales and marketing expenses 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses is due to costs associated with additional sales personnel in our regeneration segment and increases in commissions on increased sales  advertising and marketing programs  employee bonus expenses and costs related to the businesses we acquired in general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increases in legal costs  employee bonus expenses and costs associated with the businesses we acquired in  partially offset by savings related to the integration of the regeneration business 
research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to an increase in costs associated with prototyping new products  increased employee bonus expenses and certain severance costs incurred in amortization of acquired intangibles 
the increase in amortization of acquired intangibles relates to intangible assets acquired in in connection with the sme acquisition  which are being amortized over lives ranging from five to ten years  and intangible assets acquired in in connection with the osg acquisition  which are being amortized over lives ranging from three to eight years 
for  all amortization of acquired intangibles related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the regeneration acquisition  which are being amortized over lives ranging from four months to ten years 
restructuring costs 
in  we incurred restructuring charges related to our regeneration integration and certain manufacturing moves  including charges for severance  recruiting  training and other related exit costs 
income from operations 
set forth below is income from operations information for our reporting segments in thousands years ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase increase domestic rehabilitation regeneration international income from operations of reportable segments expenses not allocated to segments consolidated income from operations the increase in income from operations for each of our segments is due to increased net revenues and gross profit  which exceed increased operating expenses for each respective segment 
interest expense  net of interest income and prepayment premium and other costs related to senior subordinated notes redemption 
interest expense  net of interest income  was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease is due to reduced debt levels following the june redemption of our senior subordinated notes and other debt repayments made after the third quarter of we incurred pre tax charges aggregating million in the second quarter of related to the redemption of our senior subordinated notes 
other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december  reflects a write off of costs related to potential acquisitions that were abandoned in and net foreign exchange transaction losses 
other income expense for the year ended december  includes a net foreign exchange transaction gain and a gain on the sale of an investment  partially offset by a write off of costs related to a potential acquisition 
provision for income taxes 
our estimated worldwide effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  our tax rate for increased compared to primarily due to a higher average effective state tax rate in net income 
net income was million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  as a result of the changes discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  regeneration segment amounts in the tables below include operations for the period subsequent to the regeneration acquisition on november  and include the impact of the regeneration purchase accounting and related amortization of acquired intangible assets 
for the years ended december  and  regeneration income from operations was reduced by amortization of acquired intangible assets amounting to million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   regeneration income from operations was also reduced by restructuring charges of million related to the integration of the business operations of the segment 
the proforma amounts in the tables below show the impact of the regeneration acquisition as if it had occurred on january  net revenues 
set forth below are net revenues for our reporting segments in thousands years ended pro forma year ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase increase december  of net revenues domestic rehabilitation regeneration international consolidated net revenues net revenues in our domestic rehabilitation segment increased primarily due to the implementation of sales productivity initiatives  increased sales of rigid knee braces into school athletic programs and sales of new products 
these increases were partially offset by a negative impact from changes in in the california workers compensation system and reduced sales of certain of our pain management products 
net revenues in our domestic rehabilitation segment also increased due to growth in sales related to national contracts  the addition of approximately net new officecare locations and price increases implemented in mid  offset by price reductions in our fracture boot products due to a change in the medicare reimbursement code 
on a pro forma basis  net revenue in our regeneration segment increased due to increased sales volumes  offset by a negative impact in the third quarter of caused by disruption from the commencement of the integration of our regeneration sales organization into our donjoy sales organization 
revenues in our regeneration segment were also impacted during the third quarter of by a decline in sales of our spinalogic product  which we believe was due partly to slow market conditions and partly to weak sales performance in certain territories 
international revenues increased due partly to favorable changes in exchange rates compared to the rates in effect in excluding the impact of exchange rates  local currency international revenue increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to an increase in the number of our products we sell in our international markets and the addition of our new direct sales subsidiary in the nordic countries  effective september  gross profit 
set forth below is gross profit information for our reporting segments in thousands years ended pro forma year ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase increase december  of net revenues domestic rehabilitation regeneration international consolidated gross profit the improvement in consolidated gross profit and gross profit margin is primarily related to the favorable impact of higher gross margins associated with the products sold in our regeneration segment  continued manufacturing cost reduction initiatives and a reduction in expenses associated with employee bonuses  partially offset by increased freight costs 
gross profit increased in the domestic rehabilitation segment primarily due to a favorable product mix  including increased sales to our third party payor customers which carry a higher gross margin than other domestic rehabilitation sales  and certain price increases implemented in mid  partially offset by price reductions due to a change in the medicare reimbursement code for certain fracture boot products and by increased sales through our national contracts  which carry lower gross margins 
on a pro forma basis and excluding the impact of one time purchase accounting adjustments  regeneration gross profit increased as a percentage of revenues due to reduced cost of goods sold for these products and a higher mix of insurance sales  which have higher average selling prices and therefore generate higher gross margins than sales to wholesale customers 
the increase in the international gross profit is primarily related to the favorable impact of changes in exchange rates and the addition of the incremental in market gross margin on our direct sales in the nordic countries since september  operating expenses 
set forth below is operating expense information in thousands years ended pro forma year ended december  of net revenues december  of net revenues increase increase december  of net revenues sales and marketing general and administrative research and development amortization of acquired intangibles restructuring costs consolidated operating expenses sales and marketing expenses

these increases were offset by a reduction in expenses associated with employee bonuses 
our international segment also incurred increased expenses in related to our new subsidiaries in france and denmark  added in september and september  respectively  and a bi annual trade exhibition in europe 
general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributed to million of expenses related to the regeneration segment  increased professional fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  and legal costs  including the settlement of a contract dispute  offset by a reduction in expenses associated with employee bonuses 
general and administrative expenses also increased in related to increased efforts to maximize cash collections from our third party payor customers 
research and development expenses

the following table lists our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations represents scheduled principal payments for through under the term loan portion of our credit facility 
in october  we entered into a lease agreement with professional real estate services  inc pres under which pres has undertaken to build a new  square foot corporate headquarters facility for us on vacant land currently leased to us in vista  california 
construction of the new facility is underway and once completed  we will occupy the facility under a year lease with two five year options to extend the term and will move out of our existing facilities in vista 
rent for the new facility will be based on an agreed percentage of the total project cost for the construction of the facility and is not expected to exceed the rent currently paid by us for our existing vista facilities 
the new lease with pres was contingent on pres closing a transaction to purchase the existing facilities in vista  california leased by us  as well as the real property underlying the new lease 
the purchase transaction closed in february effective on the closing date  our lease for the vacant land was terminated  and when the new headquarters facility is completed and occupied  our leases for our existing vista facilities will be terminated 
those leases would otherwise have continued until february upon occupancy of the new facility  expected to occur in mid  we will make a lump sum rent payment to pres equal to of the rent that would have been due under the existing facilities leases from the termination date of the existing leases through the original expiration date  estimated at million 
if pres is able to lease our former facilities during what would have remained of the term of our existing leases  a portion of that sum may be refunded to us 
this lump sum rent payment  net of the remaining million accrual related to lease termination costs and other exit costs originally accrued in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein  will be accounted for as additional rent expense over the term of the new lease 
the contractual obligations table above assumes a july occupancy date for our new corporate headquarters and includes both estimated rent for our new facility beginning in july and the estimated lump sum rent payment of approximately million for termination of our existing facilities in july our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  fund working capital requirements and make anticipated capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds including the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and for working capital requirements 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in such event  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
we cannot assure you that any such funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
we do not currently have and have never had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
on january   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item herein  we completed the acquisition  under an agreement originally signed on december   of the shares of newmed for cash payments aggregating million euros approximately million  which included payment of certain debts of newmed 
certain sellers may also receive up to an additional million euros approximately million based on achievement of certain revenue targets for we also incurred certain transaction costs and other expenses in connection with the acquisition that are estimated to be approximately million 
we funded the cash paid on january  and our transaction expenses  with the proceeds of a million draw on our revolving line of credit 
we repaid million of this borrowing on january  as of december   we had available liquidity of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving credit facility  net of million of outstanding letters of credit 
for  we have already spent or expect to spend total cash of approximately million for the following requirements approximately million for the newmed acquisition in january  including transaction expenses  approximately million scheduled principal and interest payments on our credit facility  approximately million scheduled payments for noncancellable operating leases  up to approximately million for additional purchase price that could be paid to certain of the newmed sellers if certain revenue targets are attained  and up to approximately million for capital expenditures 
in addition  we expect to make other general corporate payments in  including the million repayment we made on our revolving line of credit in january seasonality we generally record our highest net revenues per day in the fourth quarter due to a greater number of orthopedic surgeries and injuries resulting from increased sports activity  particularly football and skiing 
in addition  during the fourth quarter  a patient has a greater likelihood of having satisfied his or her annual insurance deductible than in the first three quarters of the year  and thus there is an increase in the number of elective orthopedic surgeries 
we follow a manufacturing calendar that has a varied number of shipping days in each quarter 
although on a per day basis net revenues may be higher in a certain quarter  total net revenues may be higher or lower based upon the number of shipping days in such quarter 
conversely  we generally have lower net revenues per day during our second quarter as a result of decreased sports activity 
recent accounting pronouncements for information on the recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
our primary exposures include changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with the term loan and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at floating rates based on the london inter bank offered rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the underlying debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt represented by borrowings under our credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of at december  
based on the balance outstanding under the credit facility as of december   an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate would have caused an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
at december   up to million of variable rate borrowings were available under our million revolving credit facility 
we may use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage our interest rate risks 
however  as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   we had no such derivative financial instruments outstanding 
through our wholly owned international subsidiaries  we sell products in euros  pounds sterling  canadian dollars and danish krones 
the us dollar equivalent of our international sales denominated in foreign currencies in  and were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the foreign currencies of our subsidiaries 
the us dollar equivalent of the related costs denominated in these foreign currencies were unfavorably impacted during the same period 
in addition  the costs associated with our mexico based manufacturing operations are incurred in mexican pesos 
as we continue to distribute and manufacture our products in selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales and costs associated with our activities in these markets will continue to be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies  which could cause currency fluctuations to materially impact our operating results 
occasionally we seek to reduce the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our business through hedging transactions 
at december   we had no hedging transactions in place
