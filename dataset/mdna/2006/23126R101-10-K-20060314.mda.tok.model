item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical development company dedicated to improving the lives of patients by developing novel protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics in the areas of oncology  inflammatory diseases  and diabetes 
we have taken a systematic approach to identifying and validating the most promising therapeutic targets from our past research into the human genome and our efforts are now focused on developing and advancing potential therapeutics through preclinical and clinical development 
as our pipeline has matured over the past few years  we have decreased our early stage target discovery efforts and focused our resources on the advancement of our oncology therapeutics in the areas of cancer supportive care and the treatment of cancer 
our majority owned subsidiary   has commercialized advanced technologies for high throughput genetic analysis to perform rapid and comprehensive determination of the nucleotide sequence of entire genomes whole genome sequencing and to perform ultra deep sequencing of  or accurate detection of mutations in  target genes of interest 
preclinical and clinical therapeutics we are currently focusing our resources on our oncology therapeutics in the areas of cancer supportive care and the treatment of cancer 
we also maintain a portfolio of protein  antibody  and small molecule therapeutics  and targets in various stages of development in the areas of oncology  inflammatory diseases and diabetes 
oncology pipeline velafermin is a protein therapeutic  recombinant human fibroblast growth factor  that is being investigated for both the prevention and treatment of om  a debilitating side effect frequently experienced by cancer patients receiving treatment consisting of chemotherapy  radiotherapy or a combination thereof 
in december  we completed a phase ii clinical trial on velafermin that randomized patients to receive a single administration of either placebo or one of three doses of velafermin 
the results suggest that a single dose of mg kg velafermin administered to patients receiving high dose chemotherapy with or without total body irradiation one day after reinfusion of stem cells may reduce the incidence of om  however the primary analysis for a linear dose trend across increasing doses of velafermin did not achieve statistical significance 
we plan to continue evaluating velafermin in a second phase ii trial  which is expected to begin enrolling patients during the second quarter of this study will evaluate the efficacy of mg kg velafermin compared to placebo for the prevention of om  and also evaluate the activity of a single dose of either mg kg velafermin or mg kg velafermin 
the safety of velafermin for the treatment of active om was also explored in a phase i trial of nine patients 
the results from this trial suggest that multiple doses of velafermin were well tolerated and support further evaluation in subsequent studies  pxd is a small molecule therapeutic that inhibits the activity of the enzyme hdac and is being evaluated for the treatment of solid and hematologic cancers either alone or in combination with other active chemotherapeutic drugs and newer targeted agents 
pxd is being evaluated in phase ii as a single agent for the treatment of multiple myeloma and t cell lymphoma  and in phase ib trials evaluating the safety and potential activity of pxd in combination with other chemotherapeutic and newer targeted drugs for colorectal cancer  ovarian cancer  and multiple myeloma  cr is a fully human monoclonal adc that targets gpnmb  a protein located specifically on the surface of melanoma cells and is being evaluated as a treatment for metastatic melanoma 
we expect to initiate clinical trials with cr in the first half of  cr is a fully human monoclonal adc that targets tim  also known as t cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain  and is in preclinical studies to evaluate its role in the treatment of ovarian cancer and renal cell carcinoma  and cr is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets slpi  also known as secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor  a protein located on the surface of certain cancer cells  and is in preclinical studies to evaluate its role in the treatment of colorectal and ovarian cancers 

table of contents non oncology portfolio cr is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets pdgf d  also known as platelet derived growth factor d  and has been investigated for the treatment of kidney inflammation associated with diabetic nephropathy  iga nephropathy and lupus nephritis 
a phase i study of cr in healthy male volunteers was completed in and the safety  tolerability  and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile are supportive of additional clinical trials 
we are looking to license cr to a partner with the necessary resources and expertise required for developing this potential therapeutic  and bay is a small molecule therapeutic that is being investigated as a potential treatment for type diabetes 
this compound was identified under our ongoing metabolic disease collaboration with bayer and is expected to enter clinical trials in the first half of in addition  we have several potential protein  antibody  and small molecule therapeutics that have been or are being prepared to be evaluated in animal studies 
we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities for these assets through partnerships  licensing  or the filing of ind applications in the future 
life sciences corporation was formed in as our majority owned subsidiary 
has commercialized advanced technologies for rapidly and comprehensively determining the nucleotide sequence of entire genomes whole genome sequencing and performing ultra deep sequencing of  or accurate detection of mutations in  target genes of interest 
the gs sequences more than million bases from over  independent dna fragments per five hour run on a single instrument 
we believe s affordable  high throughput technology will expand the whole genome sequencing market beyond genome centers  where the majority of such sequencing services are currently performed  to research centers and academic institutions 
commencing in  began offering  on a fee for service basis  high throughput sequencing at its sc for the analysis of virus  bacteria and small fungi  and in  began commercializing its instrument systems and reagents to customers 
in may  signed a five year exclusive worldwide agreement with f 
hoffmann la roche ltd for the promotion  sales and distribution of the gs and reagents by roche 
during the fourth quarter of the installed base of the gs more than doubled  bringing the total installed base to twenty gss as of december  as s instruments and reagents are commercialized by roche and contract sequencing services are performed by  we anticipate that will contribute revenue and value to the consolidated entity 
summary we expect to generate value for our shareholders by developing novel therapeutics 
we expect to become profitable by commercializing a subset of therapeutics stemming from our development pipeline  and establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and commercialization of other therapeutics from our development pipeline 
our failure to successfully develop pharmaceutical products that we can commercialize would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalties or other revenue generated from commercial sales of products developed through the application of our technologies and expertise are not expected for several years  if at all 
we expect that our revenue or income sources for at least the next several years may be limited to grant  service  milestone and product revenue  and interest income 
we expect to continue incurring substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on preclinical studies and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein  antibody and small molecule product candidates  external programs identified by our platform as being promising and synergistic with our products and expertise  and  as it continues to work on the development and commercialization of its technology for whole genome analysis 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time 
table of contents consuming and expensive process 
we will incur substantial expenses for  and devote a significant amount of time to  these studies 
as a result  we expect to incur continued losses over the next several years  unless we are able to realize significant revenues through s sales of genomic analysis services and the gs the timing and amounts of such revenues cannot be predicted with certainty and may fluctuate 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the classifications used in see note to our consolidated financial statements for reclassifications 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses and inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition overview we recognize revenue when all four criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of the products has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and the collectibility is reasonably assured  in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which set forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
grant revenue grant revenue is recorded when qualifying expenses are incurred for the research that is performed as set forth under the terms of s federal grant award agreements from the nhgri 
instrument and reagent sales and royalties revenue from instruments sold directly by is recognized upon the completion of installation of the equipment and training of customer personnel 
for those customers  needed to determine the completion of each of these deliverables before revenue could be recognized 
additionally  certain customers require that s instruments be tested prior to their acceptance of the instruments 
for those customers  revenue is recognized upon acknowledgement of acceptance from the customer 
reagent sales that are directly sold by are recognized upon shipment of the products under fob shipping or upon receipt by s customer under fob destination based upon terms and conditions outlined in customers purchase orders 
included with instruments sold directly by  is a maintenance contract which generally is for one year 
revenue for the maintenance contract is recognized ratably over the term 
in  commercialized its gs which includes instrument systems and reagents 
in october  roche began selling and distributing the gs products 
table of contents worldwide 
sells the gs components to roche at an agreed upon transfer price 
additionally  earns a royalty on sales to third parties completed by roche 
sales of instruments and reagents to roche have been recognized upon shipment of products under fob shipping point as risk of loss transfers to roche once s products are loaded onto a roche carrier 
s return policies for product sales require that either replace defective products with new products or repair the defective products 
s returns to date have not been significant  however  if were to experience an increase in returns  s gross margins could be adversely affected 
royalties on sales to third parties completed by roche are recognized based upon royalty reports received from roche at the end of each calendar quarter 
collaboration revenue collaboration revenue is generated primarily under our pharmacogenomics agreement the bayer agreement with bayer and under the roche license  supply and distribution agreement dated may  between and f 
hoffmann la roche ltd the roche license agreement 
payments under the terms of these agreements consist of non refundable fixed quarterly payments received in advance under the bayer agreement and up front payments and commission royalty sales based payments under the roche license agreement 
the non refundable fixed quarterly payments received in advance under the bayer agreement relate to our future performance of services and are deferred and recognized as revenue when the future performance occurs  based upon the satisfaction of defined metrics of completion  as outlined in the bayer agreement  which include proportional performance and project specific deliverables 
these metrics are reviewed internally each month to determine the work performed  deliverables met  and  if required  deliverables accepted by bayer 
we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
in the event that we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual revenues could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
under the roche license agreement  we are entitled to receive both up front milestone payments for specific events  including contract negotiation and signing  supplier agreement execution and future product launches  as well as potential future commission royalty sales based payments for significant cumulative sales by roche 
up front payments under the roche license agreement are deferred and amortized into revenue on a straight line basis from the later of the date the payment was earned or the effective date of the agreement  through the end of the agreement term 
commission royalty sales based payments under the roche license agreement will be recorded in revenue as earned 
however  to date we have not earned any commission royalty sales based payments 
in evaluating revenue recognition for up front milestone payments and for commission royalty sales based payment  we estimate the date the milestone was earned and make judgments as to the method by which to amortize the revenue and which of the payments were up front milestone and which of the payments were commission royalty sales based payments 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimates at any particular balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  
table of contents fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
inventory inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes material  labor and estimates related to manufacturing overhead costs 
cost is determined using the first in first out method for non lot controlled items and on the specific identification basis for lot controlled items 
lot controlled items relate to critical components in s instrument and reagent manufacturing process 
in order to state inventory at net realizable value  records adjustments to inventory for potentially excess  obsolete or impaired goods based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for its instrument and reagent manufacturing process and market conditions 
to date  these adjustments have been immaterial 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are subject to uncertainty 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional reserves based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory would result in a corresponding increase to cost of revenues

the increase in grant revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was a result of two federal grants awarded to in may and september from the nhgri  one of the nih 
these grants partially funded the continued scale up of s technology 
we expect grant revenue to decrease in comparison to based on the research plans outlined under these two grants 
instrument and reagent sales and royalties 
during  began selling its gs and proprietary kits and reagents  and recognized million in revenue related to sales to its customers 
during the first nine months of  s customer base included genomic sequencing centers and academic institutions 
in october  roche began selling and distributing the gs products worldwide 
under the roche license agreement  manufactures and sells the gs related proprietary kits and reagents to roche  at an agreed upon transfer price  and earns a royalty on sales to third parties completed by roche 
we expect that instrument and reagent sales and royalties will increase as the gs is distributed worldwide by roche 
collaboration revenue 
curagen s collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was consistent with we expect that our collaboration revenue will decrease to approximately million as compared to  reflecting the expected completion  during the first half of  of the remaining work under the bayer agreement 
the increase in s collaboration revenue for year ended december  as compared to  was related to additional sales of genomic analysis services and revenue recognized in the fourth quarter  in addition to the amortization of the milestone payments from roche 
we expect s collaboration revenue to increase as additional sales of genomic analysis services are expected due to the acceptance of s technology in the marketplace  as revenue is recognized for a full year of amortization of the up front milestones received from roche  and as additional milestone revenue is recognized for amortization related to up front payments expected from roche in revenue is recognized for these milestones beginning on the later of either the date the milestone is earned or the date of the roche commercial launch which was in october  through the end of the roche agreement in october grant research expenses 
the increase in grant research expenses for the year ended december  as compared to  was a result of two federal grants awarded to in may and september from the nih  which partially funded the scale up of s technology 
grant research expenses for the first grant were recorded beginning in mid may and for the second grant beginning at the end of september these expenses included personnel costs and lab supplies that were directly related to the research outlined in the grant award 
we expect grant expenses to decrease in comparison to based on the research plan outlined under these two grants

we expect the cost of instrument and reagent sales to increase in due to the expected increase in volume of unit sales to roche 
moreover  as a result of the costs of manufacturing instrumentation and reagents for commercial sale being capitalized into inventory at their net book value on february   and selling instruments and reagents to roche at agreed upon transfer prices effective october  the profit margin we earn on gs components is expected to decrease in as compared to research and development expenses 
the following table sets forth a comparison of research and development expenses by segment  for the years ended december  and in millions change change research and development expenses curagen total research and development expenses consist primarily of contractual and manufacturing costs of our drug pipeline  salary and benefits  perpetual license fees and milestone payments  supplies and reagents  depreciation and amortization  and allocated facility costs 
our research and development efforts are concentrated on four major project areas clinical candidates   preclinical drug candidates  and collaborations 
with the exception of  we budget and monitor our research and development costs by expense category  rather than by project  because these costs often benefit multiple projects and or our technology platform 
below is a summary that reconciles our total research and development expenses for the years ended december  and by the major categories mentioned above in millions change change contractual and manufacturing costs salary and benefits perpetual license fees and milestone payments supplies and reagents depreciation and amortization allocated facility costs total research and development expenses the decrease in curagen s research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to was primarily due to reductions in salary and benefits  and supplies and reagents  in connection with the september and october restructuring plans  as well as a decrease in perpetual license fees offset by an increase of million in milestone payments made to topotarget  offset by increased contractual service costs related to clinical trials and manufacturing  and the bayer metabolic disorder collaboration agreement 
we anticipate our research and development expenses for will decrease slightly as compared to research and development expenses for the full year the decrease in research and development expenses for for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to lab supplies and reagents and contractual services recorded as grant research expenses in that were classified as research and development expenses in although there 
table of contents was a net increase in personnel  various personnel that were in research and development in were moved into instrument and reagent production in  and  as such  salary and benefits  supplies and reagents  and allocated facility costs which were expensed as research and development in were capitalized into inventory and expensed as costs of goods sold in when the corresponding products were sold 
also hired a number of additional research and development personnel in we expect s research and development expenses to increase in as compared to in support of anticipated new product launches 
as soon as curagen advances a potential clinical candidate into clinical trials  we begin to track the direct research and development expenses associated with that potential clinical candidate 
the following table shows the cumulative direct research and development expenses as of december   as well as the current direct research and development expenses for the years ended december  and which were incurred on or after we started conducting a phase i clinical trial for a clinical candidate clinical trial costs therapeutic area and clinical candidate class cumulative as of december  since commencement of phase i trial in millions year ended december  in millions year ended december  in millions indication trial status cancer supportive care velafermin protein oral mucositis phase ii oncology pxd small molecule various cancers phase ii kidney inflammation cr antibody kidney inflammation phase i currently  our potential pharmaceutical products require significant research and development efforts and preclinical testing  and will require extensive evaluation in clinical trials prior to submitting an application to regulatory agencies for their commercial use 
although we are conducting human studies with respect to velafermin  pxd and cr  we may not be successful in developing or commercializing these or other products 
our product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products and we cannot currently provide reliable estimates as to when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
completion of research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trials may take many years 
estimates of completion periods for any of our major research and development projects are highly speculative and variable  and dependent on the nature of the disease indication  how common the disease is among the general populace  and the results of the research 
for example  preclinical testing and clinical trials can often go on for an indeterminate period of time since the results of tests are continually monitored  with each test considered complete only when sufficient data has been accumulated to assess whether the next phases are warranted or whether the effort should be abandoned 
typically  phase i clinical trials are expected to last between and months  phase ii clinical trials are expected to last between and months and phase iii clinical trials are expected to last between and months 
the most significant time and costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
in addition  many factors may delay the commencement and speed of completion of preclinical testing and clinical trials  including the number of patients participating in the trial  the duration of patient follow up required  the number of clinical sites at which the trials are conducted  and the length of time required to locate and enroll suitable patient subjects 
the successful completion of our development programs and the successful development of our product candidates are highly uncertain and are subject to numerous challenges and risks 
therefore  we cannot presently estimate anticipated completion dates for any of our projects  as described more fully in the risk factors section under the heading risks related to our business 

table of contents due to the variability in the length of time necessary to develop a product candidate  the uncertainties related to the cost of projects and the need to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
if our major research and development projects are delayed  then we can expect to incur additional costs in conducting our preclinical testing and clinical trials and a longer period of time before we become profitable from our operating activities  as described more fully in the risk factors titled we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses in the future and we may need to raise additional funding  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
accordingly  the timing of the potential market approvals for our existing clinical stage product candidates  velafermin  pxd  cr  and future product development candidates  will have a significant impact on our capital requirements

the following table sets forth a comparison of general and administrative expenses by segment  for the years ended december  and in millions change change general and administrative expenses curagen total the decrease in curagen s general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to  was a result of careful control of expenses  as well as the and corporate restructurings and lower patent prosecution costs 
our general and administrative expenses are expected to remain constant for the full year as compared to the increase in s general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to  is attributable to the growth in the employee base as a result of the commercialization of s gs accordingly  s general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase during as compared to restructuring and related charges 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded a charge of million  including million related to employee separation costs  million of operating lease obligations and million of asset impairment costs 
the cash requirements under the restructuring plan were million  of which million was paid prior to december  the remaining cash requirements of million will be paid through interest income 
interest income for year ended december  increased slightly compared to primarily due to higher yields in our investment portfolio offset by lower cash and investment balances 
we earned an average yield of in as compared to in in we expect the yields in our investment portfolio to be slightly higher than however  due to the continued utilization of cash and investment balances in the normal course of operations  we anticipate interest income to decrease by approximately million in in the event that during we use cash to repay a portion of our remaining existing debt due in  our estimate of the anticipated decrease in interest income for will differ accordingly 
interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to related to the second and third quarter repurchases of million and million  respectively  of our convertible subordinated debentures due we expect interest expense to be approximately million during  primarily attributable to the interest paid semi annually to the holders of our million convertible subordinated debentures due in  and our million convertible subordinated notes due in in the event that during we use cash to repay a portion of our remaining existing debt due in  our estimate of interest expense will differ accordingly

future liquidity 
during the next twelve months  we expect to continue to fund our operations through a combination of the following sources cash and investment balances  instrument and reagent sales and royalties  collaboration revenue  milestone payments  interest income  grant revenue  potential public securities offerings  and or private strategic driven common stock offerings 
we plan to continue making substantial investments to advance our preclinical and clinical drug pipeline  as well as to advance s next generation sequencing technologies 
accordingly  we foresee the following as significant uses of liquidity contractual services related to clinical trials and manufacturing  salary and benefits  perpetual license fees  supplies and reagents  potential milestone payments  and costs related to in addition  we expect the payments of interest to the holders of our convertible subordinated debt due in and to be a continued significant use of liquidity 
depending on market and other conditions  we may continue to repurchase or refinance portions of the existing convertible subordinated debentures due in open market purchases  in privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
such repurchases may be material and may affect interest income and interest expense as well as gains or losses on extinguishment of debt 
in addition  we also may use sources of liquidity for working capital  and for general corporate purposes and potentially for future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and extent of our acquisitions  our product development activities  and our 
table of contents investments in technology and the amount of cash generated by our operations 
actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates 
our failure to use sources of liquidity effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our requirements for the next twenty four months 
our operating and capital expenditures are considered to be crucial to our future success  and by continuing to make strategic investments in our preclinical and clinical drug pipeline  we believe that we are building substantial value for our shareholders 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements  including the repayment of the remaining balance of our million of convertible subordinated debentures due february   and our million of convertible subordinated notes due february   will depend on many factors 
these factors include the number  breadth and progress of our research  product development and clinical programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products  potential future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  in licensing of pharmaceutical products  and costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
while we will continue to explore alternative sources for financing our business activities  including the possibility of public securities offerings and or private strategic driven common stock offerings  we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development 
however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objective of our long term business plan  which is to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products  and may be unable to continue operations 
this result could cause our shareholders to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  we maintain approximately of our cash and investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of three months or less  in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than three months and less than one year  and the remaining in financial instruments with original maturity dates of equal to or greater than one year and less than five years 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
we estimate that a change of basis points in interest rates would result in a million decrease or increase in the fair value of our cash and investments 
our outstanding long term liabilities as of december  consisted primarily of million of our convertible subordinated debentures due february   million of our convertible subordinated notes due february   million in deferred revenue and an accrued long term liability of million for the remaining future minimum payments under a license agreement see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as the debentures and notes bear interest at a fixed rate  our results of operations would not be affected by interest rate changes 
although future borrowings may bear interest at a floating rate  and would therefore be affected by interest rate changes  at this point we do not anticipate any significant future borrowings at floating interest rates  and therefore do not believe that a change of basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 
as of december   the market value of our million convertible subordinated debentures due  based on quoted market prices  was estimated at million  and the market value of our million convertible subordinated notes due  based on quoted market prices  was estimated at million
