item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k  including the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements that may involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from those discussed herein 
factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item business summary of business considerations and certain factors that may affect future results of operations and or stock price 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop  market and support private wireless communications  including wireless radios and wireless communications infrastructure and systems for digital and analog platforms 
in addition  we offer encryption technologies for analog wireless radios 
we provide our products and systems to homeland security  defense  public safety and public service  commercial users and international markets 
customers for our products and systems include federal  state and local governmental entities  domestic enterprise users  and international entities 
private wireless communications our private wireless communications segment designs  develops  markets and supports secure wireless radios  wireless communications infrastructure and systems 
our wireless radio offerings are primarily digital solutions designed to operate in both conventional analog and newer digital system environments 
our products and systems are based on industry standards designed to enhance interoperability among systems  improve bandwidth efficiency  and integrate voice and data communications 
the private wireless communications industry provides two way wireless communications through wireless networks  which include infrastructure components such as base stations  transmitters and receivers  network switches and portable and mobile two way communication radios 
individual users operate portable hand held radios and vehicular mounted radios in the private wireless communications system 
utilizing free licensed rf spectrum  the customer owns and operates the private wireless communications system  that is networked by linking the infrastructure components together 
we develop customer solutions  which leverage the customer s private wireless system and wireless radios with customer specific or enterprise wide applications 
the majority of our revenue in our private wireless communications segment is derived from the sale of wireless radio products 
our federal  state and local governmental agency customers are increasingly demanding interoperable  secured  private wireless communications products and systems 
we believe this demand has created significant opportunities for us as we believe we are well positioned to provide these products and systems 
as a result  we expect to continue to allocate an increasing share of our on going research and development expenditures to infrastructure components and system development efforts 
we shipped our first trunked system in the second quarter of we anticipate that these infrastructure components and digital systems will begin to generate a material part of our private wireless communications segment revenues in in  we relocated our private wireless communications operations from waseca  minnesota to irving  texas to benefit from a larger and more experienced engineering and marketing community  and to increase synergistic opportunities with other local technology providers 
concurrent with this move  we began to outsource the manufacturing of our products and systems 
secured communications our secured communications segment designs  develops  markets and supports secured communications products such as highly secure encryption technologies for analog wireless radios 
these products are specifically designed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive voice communications 
our secured communications segment leverages our leading market position to gain new customers in parts of the world where wireless radio systems remain analog  security needs are high  and the cost to upgrade to a digital secured communications system is usually prohibitive 
our secured communications products are sold as aftermarket add on components or embedded components for existing analog radios and systems 
we have also developed an analog encryption product that uses digital technology in order to obtain higher levels of security and allows for compatibility with our analog encryption product line 
our private wireless communications products and systems are sold domestically through a direct sales force  dealers and manufacturing representatives 
we utilize our dealer network to assist in installing  servicing  selling and distributing our products 
our secured communications sales are achieved through a select group of dealers and distributors 
much of our business is obtained through submission of formal competitive bids 
our governmental customers generally specify the terms  conditions and form of the contract 
government business is subject to government funding decisions and contract types can vary widely  including fixed priced  indefinite delivery indefinite quantity  or idiq  and government wide acquisition contracts with the general services administration  or gsa  which requires pre qualification of vendors and allows government customers to more easily procure our products and systems 
our product revenue is generated under purchase orders  which are made and generally fulfilled within a day period 
as such  we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future revenues 
our system revenue is generated under long term contracts  and is recorded under the percentage of completion method 
factors affecting our business fluctuations and seasonality of results due to the timing of orders and seasonality  our quarterly results fluctuate 
in our private wireless communications segment  we experience seasonality in our results in part due to governmental customer spending patterns that are influenced by government fiscal year end budgets and appropriations 
the impact of this is primarily realized in the fourth quarter  consistently our strongest quarter 
the unpredictable sales cycle and aftermarket nature of our secured communications business can also cause significant variations from quarter to quarter 
recently  we have experienced greater revenues in our first and fourth quarters 
gross margins there are a number of factors that have impacted and will impact our gross margins 
these include revenue mix we have historically generated consistently higher gross margins from our secured communications products 
the mix of revenues between our private wireless communications and secured communications segments can cause our gross margins to vary from period to period 
facility move during  we began moving efjohnson s operations in waseca  minnesota to irving  texas 
we completed the move during the first quarter of this move involved periods of planned duplicative operations and inefficiencies in the manufacturing of our wireless communications products 
in june  we completed the move of our corporate headquarters from washington  dc to irving  texas 
outsourcing during  we made the decision to design our own rf module and outsource manufacturing of our products and systems 
through the first quarter of  we produced most of our private wireless communications products at our minnesota facility 
as of march   the minnesota facility was closed  and we transitioned this production to our texas based outsource vendor 
in late and  we also began integrating our own rf module instead of purchasing a third party module 
these activities negatively impacted our gross margins during however  we believe that these actions will begin to have a positive impact in early research and development with the adoption of the project standard  the need for digital product technology for government customers has increased 
as such  we concentrate our research and development efforts on digital technology for our growing private wireless communications segment 
we will continue to develop products and systems in  to include feature enhancements and additions  which comply with the project standard 
in  research and development expenditures have been concentrated on trunked and conventional project system infrastructure  including repeaters  voters and base stations  applying standard internet protocol switching techniques for connecting wireless sites utilizing voip technology  integration of new rf modules into current radios  and our project regarding digital encryption of analog transmissions 
additional non cash compensation in due to stock option repricing in and  we repriced stock options covering  shares of common stock 
as such  they are subject to variable accounting treatment 
our non cash compensation benefit expense from these repriced stock options was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   repriced stock options covering only  of the  shares of common stock remain outstanding 
description of operating accounts revenues 
revenues consist of product sales and services  net of returns and allowances  system sales revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method  and shipping fees billed to customers 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes costs of components and materials  labor  depreciation and overhead costs associated with the production of our products  as well as shipping  royalty  inventory reserves  warranty product costs and incurred cost under sales contracts 
gross profit 
gross profit is net revenues less the cost of sales and is affected by a number of factors  including competitive pricing  product mix  business segment mix and cost of products and services 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with research and development personnel  materials  and the depreciation of research and development equipment and facilities 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of sales personnel  including sales commissions and travel expenses  as well as costs of advertising  public relations and trade show participation 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other expenses associated with our management  accounting  it and administrative functions 
this expense also includes the impact of the variable accounting treatment of repriced stock options and costs related to our operating facilities moves 
net interest income or expense 
net interest income expense consists of interest income earned on cash and invested funds  net of interest expense capital leases and commitment fees on the bank line of credit 
provision for income taxes 
provision benefit for income taxes includes the increase or decrease in the valuation reserve that is based upon management s conclusions regarding  among other considerations  our historical operating results and forecasted future earnings over a five year period  our current and expected customer base projections  and technological and competitive factors impacting our current products 
current financial accounting standards require that organizations analyze all positive and negative evidence relating to deferred tax asset realization  which would include our historical accuracy in forecasting future earnings  as well as our history of losses prior to should factors underlying management s estimates change  future adjustments  either positive or negative  to our valuation allowance may be necessary 
our tax asset is principally composed of net tax benefits associated with net operating loss carryforwards  or nols 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare our financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  application of the percentage of completion accounting for long term contract revenues  inventory reserves  warranty reserves  valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets  and contingencies 
these estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the particular applicable facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  require estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  and have the potential to result in materially different outcomes under varying assumptions and conditions 
the application of gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying results 
listed below are those policies we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue product revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete  less an estimate for an allowance for returns  if applicable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the earnings process is generally complete when the product is shipped  or received by the customer  depending upon whether the title to the goods  as well as the risks and benefits of ownership  are transferred to the customer at point of shipment or point of delivery as typically we have no further obligations with respect to the sale which impact the functionality of the product 
for sales where collection is not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue as cash is received 
if collection is contingent on a future event  we recognize revenue when the contingency lapses  generally upon cash collection 
system sales under long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenues are recognized as work on a contract progresses 
the recognized revenue is that percentage of estimated total revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total costs to complete the contract 
revisions in cost and profit estimates are made when conditions requiring such revisions become known 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in operations as soon as such losses are determined to be probable and reasonably estimable 
deferred revenue includes unearned services provided under systems maintenance contracts 
we recognize the fees based upon a straight line method over the life of the contract 
we periodically review our revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletins and  statement of position and other interpretations  as applicable 
in addition  while most of our current products contain software  we believe the software is incidental in the overall context of our product s features and functionality  therefore  at present we do not use revenue recognition pronouncements applicable to software sales 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
we periodically assess our inventories for potential obsolescence and lower of cost or market issues 
we make estimates of inventory obsolescence  providing reserves when necessary  based on  among other factors  demand for inventories based on backlog  product pricing  the ability to liquidate or sell older inventories  and the impact of introducing new products 
a significant portion of our inventories is comprised of components and parts on hand to support maintenance of products previously sold 
as such  we anticipated utilizing such inventories over extended periods of time 
our obsolescence and lower of cost or market accounting policies provide for a periodic adjustment to the carrying value of such inventories 
goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually  we assess goodwill and tradename  using fair value based tests 
if the respective carrying amount exceeds the fair value  goodwill or tradename are considered to be impaired 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of the expected future cash flows derived from such goodwill and present value implied by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses  other factors 
the estimates use assumptions about our market segment share in the future and about future expenditures by government entities for private wireless communications products 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill or tradename may not be recoverable 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that recoverability of tax assets is not considered likely 
in determining recoverability of the future tax benefits associated with our deferred tax asset  management takes into account  among other factors  our historical operating results  our current and expected customer base  technological and competitive factors impacting our current products  and management s estimates of future earnings that are based upon a five year earnings projection  using information currently available  and discounted for risk 
if we fail to achieve revenue growth rates or gross margins assumed in the calculation of the deferred tax asset  we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in the future 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  to include intangible assets subject to amortization  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such long lived asset or group of long lived assets collectively referred to as the asset may not be recoverable 
such circumstances include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market price of the asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  a significant change in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a current period loss combined with projection of continuing loss associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  the asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred 
when such events or circumstances exist  the recoverability of the asset s carrying value shall be determined by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows cash inflows less associated cash outflows that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
to date  no such impairment has occurred 
to the extent such events or circumstances occur that could affect the recoverability of our long lived assets  we may be required to impair these assets

during the third quarter of  we recorded certain adjustments  the effect of which was to increase cost of sales and decrease gross margin by in the third quarter 
if these adjustments had been recorded in the second quarter  our gross margin would have been approximately for both the second and third quarters of these adjustments had no impact on the annual amounts reported for the year ended december  we historically have experienced substantial variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter 
the level of revenues in a particular quarter varies primarily based upon the timing of customer purchase orders  due principally to the seasonal nature of governmental budgeting processes and the needs of competing budgetary concerns of our customers during the year 
other factors that affect the results of operations in a particular quarter include the timing of the introduction of new products  general economic conditions  the timing and mix of product sales and specific economic conditions in the private wireless communications and secured communications industries 
we believe that quarterly results are likely to vary for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources based upon our current level of operations  we expect that our cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next twelve months 
our business strategy includes pursing strategic acquisitions  which may necessitate that we incur debt or issue additional equity to finance such acquisitions 
net cash from operating activities our operating activities provided used cash of million  million  and million in  and respectively 
cash used in or provided from operating activities is primarily a reflection of our collections on billed receivables  investment in inventories and expenditures for operations 
during  we collected million of billed receivables which effectively reduced cash from operating activities by million 
this reduction primarily related to three significant accounts with departments of the federal government included in the private wireless communication segment 
additionally  million of cash was used to purchase inventories and million was used for operating expenses 
during  we collected million of billed receivables which approximates our recorded revenue 
in addition  million was used to purchase inventories and million was used for operating expenses 
during  we collected million of billed receivables which effectively reduced cash from operating activities by million

during  million was utilized to purchase fixed assets 
net cash from financing activities financing activities provided used cash of million in  million during  and million during during  cash of was generated by the sale of  shares of common stock in august  during  we used million in financing activities  substantially related to paying off our million outstanding line of credit balance in february cash of million and million was generated through exercise of employee stock options during and  respectively 
our cash position improved significantly in as a result of the successful follow on offering of common stock  partially offset with the increase in accounts receivable as noted above 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million in as compared to an increase of million to million in cash and cash equivalents decreased by million in to million 
letters of credits and bonds in the normal course of our business activities related to sales of wireless radio systems to local and state governmental entities  we are required under contracts with various government authorities to provide letters of credit or performance or bid bonds that may be drawn upon if we fail to perform under our contracts 
our outstanding letters of credit had a total undrawn balance of million on december  bonds  which expire on various dates  totaled million at december  our current bonding arrangement calls for zero collateral bonding up to million  however  no single bond may exceed million 
we believe our bonding arrangements provide us with sufficient bonding availability through operating leases we also lease various equipment and buildings under operating leases 
future minimum rental payments under non cancelable operating lease agreements are shown below in the table under the subheading contractual obligations 
of the million total operating lease obligations  million relate to the leases of our operating facilities for our secured communications segment  which lease runs through june  and our private wireless communications segment  which lease runs through december we anticipate that  in the normal course of business  leases will be renewed or replaced as they expire 
secured line of credit we have a secured million line of credit with bank of america that bears interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the line of credit is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  and borrowings available under the line of credit are calculated as a percentage of eligible inventory and receivables 
this amended revolving line of credit expires in september and contains certain financial and negative covenants 
financial covenants include requirements to maintain a tangible net worth of million plus of preceding fiscal year s net income  funded debt to ebitda ratio of to  fixed charge coverage ratio of to  and positive ebitda over any preceding two quarter period 
negative covenants include restrictions on incurring debt above million  encumbrances  acquisitions  transferring assets  or making large capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with all financial and negative covenants at december  at december   we had no amounts outstanding on the revolving line of credit  and the total available line of credit was million 
the difference between the million line of credit and the million available line of credit reflects the outstanding letters of credit issued again the line of credit of million 
dividend policy since our initial public offering  we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock 
we presently intend to retain earnings for use in our operations and to finance our business 
any change in our dividend policy is within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend  among other things  on our earnings  debt service and capital requirements  restrictions in financing agreements  if any  business conditions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations our known contractual obligations as of december  are shown below payment due by period contractual obligations in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities deferred revenue total off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  or vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in vie transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although our sales have historically been denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in the value of international currencies relative to the us dollar may affect the price  competitiveness and profitability of our products sold in international markets 
furthermore  the uncertainty of monetary exchange values has caused  and may in the future cause  some foreign customers to delay new orders or delay payment for existing orders 
additionally  troubled economic conditions  such as that recently experienced in asia and in latin america  could result in lower revenues for us 
while most international sales are supported by letters of credit  the purchase of our products by international customers presents increased risks  which include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  political and economic instability in foreign markets  difficulties in establishing foreign distribution channels  longer payment cycles or uncertainty in the collection of accounts receivable  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  cultural differences in the conduct of business  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  and susceptibility to orders being cancelled as a result of foreign currency fluctuations since historically  our quotations and invoices are denominated in us dollars 
our secured communications products are subject to export controls under us law  which in most cases requires the approval of the department of commerce in order to ship internationally 
we cannot assure that such approvals will be available to us or our products in the future in a timely manner or at all or that the federal government will not revise its export policies or the list of products and countries for which export approval is required 
our inability to obtain required export approvals would adversely affect our international sales  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  foreign companies not subject to united states export restrictions may have a competitive advantage in the international secured communications market 
we cannot predict the impact of these factors on the international market for our products
