item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation application of critical accounting policies application of our accounting policies requires management to make certain judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the financial statements 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments  although differing amounts could be reported if there are changes in the assumptions and estimates 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory allowances  impairment costs  depreciation and amortization  warranty costs  taxes and contingencies 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to an understanding of our financial statements and or as areas most dependent on management s judgment and estimates 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 we recognize revenue from the sale of products when the products are shipped to the customer 
revenues from the sale of services consist of non recurring engineering charges  which are recognized when the services have been rendered 
historically  sales returns have amounted to less than of net income and all sales are recorded net of sales returns and discounts 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets using the methodology prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the company also reviews long lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
upon such an occurrence  recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows to which the assets relate  to the carrying amount 
if the asset is determined to be unable to recover its carrying value  then intangible assets  if any  are written down first  followed by the other long lived assets to fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  appraised values or management s estimates  depending on the nature of the assets 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company has incurred losses over the past years  which creates a deferred tax benefit 
up to  we have recorded a valuation allowance that fully reserved the benefit because realization was doubtful 
in  with the addition of picometrix and having had two years of profitable operations  we reduced the allowance to approximately half of the deferred asset 
with the acquisition of picometrix  we recorded a deferred tax liability to reflect the non deductible nature of the future amortization of the intangible assets acquired 
that deferred tax liability will be amortized over the same life as the intangible assets 
the results from operations in were disappointing  so there was more concern regarding utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards before they expired 
as a result  we decided to increase the reserve by approximately  to cover the loss carry forwards that expire by while we are still confident that the company will generate enough earnings to realize much of the loss carry forwards  no assurances can be given that we will generate future earnings sufficient to cover the entire net asset 
we will review the valuation allowance each year and make adjustments to reflect our best estimate of future tax benefit realization 
inventories the company s inventories are stated at standard cost which approximates the first in  first out method or market 
slow moving and obsolete inventories are reviewed throughout the year 
to calculate a reserve for obsolescence  we begin with a review of our slow moving inventory 
any inventory  which has been slow moving within the past months  is evaluated and reserved if deemed appropriate 
in addition  any residual inventory  which is customer specific and remaining on hand at the time of contract completion  is reserved for at the standard unit cost 
the complete list of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reviewed by the production  engineering and or purchasing departments to identify items that can be utilized in the near future 
these items are then excluded from the analysis and the remaining amount of slow moving and obsolete inventory is then reserved for 
additionally  non cancelable open purchase orders for parts we are obligated to purchase where demand has been reduced may be reserved 
reserves for open purchase orders where the market price is lower than the purchase order price are also established 
if a product that had previously been reserved for is subsequently sold  the amount of reserve specific to that item is then reversed 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established by analyzing each account that has a balance over days past due 
each account is individually assigned a probability of collection 
the total amount determined to be uncollectible in the days past due category is then reserved fully 
when other circumstances suggest that a receivable may not be collectible  it is immediately reserved for  even if the receivable is not yet in the days past due category 
table of contractual obligations the following table sets forth the contractual obligations of the company at march  contractual obligations payments due by period more than total within year years years years long term debt      capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations     purchase obligations   debt to related parties     total      results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues the company predominantly operates in one industry segment  light and radiation detection devices that it sells to multiple markets including telecommunications  industrial sensing ndt  military aerospace  medical  and homeland security

the acquisition of picometrix provided the company entry into the homeland security market with its terahertz products and contracts and significantly extended its reach in the telecommunication markets with optical receiver products 
the most significant revenue increases are from the telecommunications market  which increased million  all coming from the picometrix acquisition 
the industrial sensing ndt market increased or million  over the prior year of which million was attributable to picometrix 
sales to the military aerospace market increased over the prior year and accounted for approximately  of the remaining increase in revenues 
homeland security accounted for million of the increase all attributable to picometrix  inc and medical dropped  over the prior year mainly due to price reductions for one customer

marketing and sales expenses increased by  to million in fy  which is of sales  which is the same percentage as fy the acquisition of picometrix accounted for  of the sales and marketing expense increase

the remaining million increased g a costs was the result of added corporate expenses 
the sarbanes oxley act section  internal controls  requires the company to be compliant by fiscal year ending march  based on current market capitalization 
external costs required to be in compliance will materially increase over the next two years
