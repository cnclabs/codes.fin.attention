as a result  we expect a majority of our future growth to come from prudent acquisitions of gaming properties  jurisdictional expansions and  to a lesser extent  property expansion in under penetrated markets 
the continued pressure on governments to balance their budgets could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
consistent with the consolidation trend in the gaming industry  we have been very active in acquisitions since  including the acquisition of argosy on october  a number of states are currently considering or implementing legislation to legalize or expand gaming 
such legislation presents both potential opportunities to establish new properties for instance  in pennsylvania and potential competitive threats to business at our existing properties such as maryland  ohio  kentucky  and kansas 
the timing and occurrence of these events remain uncertain 
legalized gaming from casinos located on native american lands can also have a significant competitive effect 
the implementation of ticket in  ticket out tito technology at our properties has enabled us to provide better customer service as machine down time for hopper fills and the majority of hard pay jackpots are eliminated 
in addition  labor costs are reduced with the implementation of tito as most machine service functions are eliminated

and the stock held by hwcc louisiana  inc further  an event of default under the indentures for the hcs notes would not cause an event of default under the company s senior secured credit facility or senior subordinated notes

critical accounting estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods and estimates used in the preparation of financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies  including the estimated lives assigned to our assets  asset impairment  insurance reserves  the purchase price allocations made in connection with our acquisitions and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be those in which our policies  estimates and judgments have a significant impact on issues that are inherently uncertain 
long lived assets at december   we had a net property and equipment balance of  million  representing of total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are determined based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the individual property level 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
intangible assets  including goodwill as a result of our recent acquisitions  we have approximately  million in goodwill and million in other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from our acquisition of other businesses 
two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and ii the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in connection with our acquisitions  a valuation was completed to determine the allocation of the purchase prices 
the factors considered in the valuation included data gathered as result of our due diligence in connection with the acquisitions and projections for future operations 
the annual evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
because our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized  there may be volatility in reported income because impairment losses  if any  are likely to occur irregularly  in varying amounts 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and are measured at the prevailing enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences are settled or realized 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realizability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
litigation  claims and assessments we utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events  as well as assumptions about future events 
if our assessment of such a matter should change  we may have to change the estimate  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in april  the securities and exchange commission approved a rule delaying the effective date of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r for public companies 
sfas r was to be effective for public companies for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june   however  it is now effective for public companies for the first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  the rule does not change the accounting required by sfas r 
in accordance with the rule  on january   we will begin to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the financial statement impact for the year ended december  is expected to reduce both earnings per common share and earnings per common share  assuming dilution by approximately 
per share

we also entered into three three year swap contracts totaling million with a termination date of march  we accounted for these effective interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges 
the changes in the fair values of effective interest rate swaps were recorded as adjustments to accrued interest in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the amount of ineffectiveness related to the cash flow hedges in was immaterial 
under these contracts  we paid fixed rates of to against a variable rate based on the day libor rate 
the difference between amounts received and amounts paid under such agreements  as well as any costs or fees  was recorded as a reduction of  or addition to  interest expense as incurred over the life of the swap
