item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
forward looking statements are those that are not historical in nature 
the words anticipate  estimate  should  expect  believe  intend and similar expressions or the negatives of these words or phrases are intended to identify forward looking statements 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this annual report  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
overview executive summary our mission is to provide a secure stream of income for our stockholders based on the steady and reliable payments of residential mortgages made to borrowers of prime credit quality 
we began investing in  with an initial spread strategy of investing in high quality  adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities and levering these investments primarily through repurchase agreements 
while this strategy has a reduced level of credit risk  it also has considerable interest rate exposure 
the persistently flat yield curve and consecutive federal reserve rate increases since june  have pressured our ability to provide steady income  and led us to augment our strategy in the new strategy  which we refer to as our residential mortgage credit strategy  includes investments in non agency mortgage backed securities rated below aaa as well as prime whole loan purchases and securitizations of those loans  in a manner that should reduce our exposure to interest rates over time 
during  we actively pursued our business diversification into prime quality residential mortgage credit with purchases of mortgage backed securities with ratings below aaa of million  purchases of prime quality residential mortgage loans of million and the completion of our first loan securitization of million 
in january and february  we began selling certain of the mortgage backed securities in our spread portfolio and redeployed our capital primarily in our residential mortgage credit strategy 
we plan to continue pursue this strategy in as a means to continue to reduce interest rate risk  and build the basis for dividend stability and growth 
our residential mortgage credit strategy aims to complement our high quality  but interest rate sensitive spread strategy  with investments that are far less sensitive to interest rates and that are therefore more predictable and sustainable 
this strategy seeks to structure  acquire and fund mortgage loans which will provide long term reliable income to our stockholders 
we will accomplish this goal primarily through the purchase of mortgage loans which we design and originate in partnership with selected high quality providers with whom we have long and well established relationships 
we will securitize those loans with an optimal structure  retain the most valuable pieces of the securitization and thereby lock in profitable spread income over the life of the structure 
over time  these securitizations will reduce our sensitivity to interest rates and will help match the income we earn on our mortgage assets with the cost of our related liabilities 
the debt that we incur in these securitizations will be non recourse to us 
as a secondary strategy  we invest in subordinated mortgage backed securities that have credit ratings below aa 
we do this opportunistically  as we discover value and credit arbitrage opportunities in the market 
using these investment strategies  we seek to acquire mortgage related assets  finance these purchases in the capital markets and use leverage in order to provide an attractive return on stockholders equity 
we have acquired and will seek to acquire additional assets that will produce competitive returns  taking into consideration the amount and nature of the anticipated returns from the investment  our ability to pledge the investment for secured  collateralized borrowings and the costs associated with financing  managing  securitizing and reserving for these investments 

table of contents our business is affected by the following economic and industry factors that may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations interest rate trends and changes in the yield curve  rates of prepayment on our mortgage loans and the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities  continued creditworthiness of the holders of mortgages underlying our mortgage related assets  highly competitive markets for investment opportunities  and other market developments 
in addition  several factors relating to our business may also impact our financial condition and operating performance 
these factors include credit risk as defined by prepayments  delinquencies and defaults on our mortgage loans and the mortgage loans underlying our mortgage backed securities  overall leverage of our portfolio  access to funding and adequate borrowing capacity  increases in our borrowing costs  the ability to use derivatives to mitigate our interest rate and prepayment risks  the market value of our investments  and compliance with reit requirements and the requirements to qualify for an exemption under the investment company act of refer to risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for additional discussion regarding these and other risk factors that affect our business

summary and outlook for the year ended december   our net loss was million  or loss per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  for the year ended december  reit taxable net income was million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
reit taxable net income is the basis upon which we determine our dividends to stockholders 
the difference between net loss and reit taxable net income primarily relates to impairment losses on mortgage backed securities  as well as the timing of the recognition of realized gains or losses on derivative contracts used in our liability management strategy 
in conjunction with the decision to reposition our portfolio  we recorded a million impairment loss during the fourth quarter of  in our spread portfolio 
effective december   we discontinued the use of hedge accounting as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted 
as a result  beginning in the first quarter of  all changes in the value of our portfolio of hedges  including interest rate swaps and eurodollar futures contracts  will be reflected in our consolidated statement of operations rather than primarily through accumulated other comprehensive income and loss on our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect this change to introduce some volatility to our results  as the market value of the hedge positions changes 
we declared million of dividends for  or per share 
we declared million of dividends for  or per share 
our book value at december  was million  or per share 
in november  we announced a stock repurchase program permitting us to acquire up to  shares of our common stock 
at december   we had repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of per share 
through 
table of contents february  we had repurchased a total of  shares at a weighted average price of per share 
in february  we announced the initiation of an additional stock repurchase program to acquire an incremental  shares 
we will  at our discretion  purchase shares at prevailing prices through open market transactions subject to the provisions of sec rule b and in privately negotiated transactions 
at december   the composition of our billion in mortgage assets was as follows in agency short duration hybrid and arm mortgage backed securities  in aaa rated short duration hybrid securities  in prime quality securitized whole loans and in credit sensitive securities with a weighted average credit rating of bbb 
during  we actively pursued our business diversification into prime quality residential mortgage credit 
this diversification includes purchases of mortgage backed securities with ratings below aaa of million  purchases of prime quality residential mortgage loans of million and the completion of our first loan securitization of million 
we expect our credit quality to remain high as we prudently invest in residential mortgage credit risk 
in our loan purchases  we are underwriting on a loan by loan basis 
generally  our target average fico score is the midway point in our stratification around this level generally ranges between and we focus on single family  owner occupied residences with adequate valuation protection  typically in the loan to value range 
we carefully assess collateral valuation and review every loan on automated valuation screens 
our target borrower has demonstrated an ability to handle credit and carries a manageable amount of overall debt versus income 
our target loan size is well below the super jumbo level  and ranges in the to thousand range 
we also diversify our geographic exposure 
our multi factor risk analysis concentrates on layered risk  which is the conjunction of two or more risk factors in a loan 
for example  we may underwrite a very high fico borrower in a high ltv situation  whereas we may reject that same loan if the high ltv is accompanied by recent history of multiple refinancings on the same property 
in other words  no single variable predicts our loan underwriting decision perfectly 
we take a comprehensive view of each loan and underwrite on that basis 
we accept only those loans that meet our careful underwriting criteria 
once we own a loan  our surveillance process includes ongoing analysis through our proprietary data warehouse and servicer files 
we are proactive in our analysis of payment behavior and in loss mitigation through our servicing relationships 
our target market is the alt a adjustable rate loan 
alt a is one of the fastest growing segments of the mortgage market 
we believe roughly half of the prime loans made in were made in the alt a form 
in the alt a market  borrowers choose the convenience of less than full documentation in exchange for a slightly higher mortgage rate 
at december   the weighted average coupon of our total mortgage assets was 
as a result of the increases in short term interest rates over the past months  the net interest spread on our investment portfolio has decreased to from for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to increases in the cost of funds on our repurchase agreements used to fund the mortgage backed securities in our portfolios 
see additional information on the components of our net interest spread and interest expense at results of operations 
going forward  we will continue our portfolio repositioning which we expect to establish a solid foundation for the delivery of a consistent and growing dividend 
to accomplish this objective  we will transform our balance sheet away from interest rate sensitivity  and toward match funded credit oriented residential mortgage assets 
we expect our strategy of portfolio diversification begun in will improve earnings and dividends in and beyond 
we will accelerate the repositioning of our portfolio in early  including the sale of certain mortgage backed securities from our spread portfolio 
we will purchase and securitize mortgage loans from selected partners  retaining higher yielding pieces of the securitization 
we will augment these activities with opportunistic purchases of credit sensitive securities created by others 
our primary sources of capital are repurchase agreements  mortgage backed notes  warehouse lending facilities and junior subordinated notes 
we believe that our current financing and operating cash flow is sufficient to fund our business into perpetuity although there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future 
we 
table of contents intend to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity and debt securities  possibly including classes of preferred stock  common stock  commercial paper  medium term notes  collateralized mortgage obligations and senior or subordinated notes 
such financings will depend on market conditions for capital raises and upon the investment of any net proceeds therefrom 
all debt securities  other borrowings and classes of preferred stock will be senior to our common stock in any liquidation by us 
as a result of these various factors  it is difficult to project when we may seek to raise additional capital

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make some complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
our most critical accounting policies involve decisions and assessments that could significantly affect our reported assets and liabilities  as well as our reported revenues and expenses 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our consolidated financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at that time 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has identified our most critical accounting policies to be the following classifications of investment securities our investments in mortgage backed securities are classified as available for sale and are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value 
generally  the classification of securities as available for sale results in changes in fair value being recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a component of stockholders equity  rather than immediately through earnings 
if our available for sale securities were classified as trading securities  our earnings could experience substantially greater volatility from period to period 
valuations of mortgage backed securities our mortgage backed securities have fair values based on estimates provided by independent pricing services and dealers in mortgage backed securities 
because the price estimates may vary between sources  management makes certain judgments and assumptions about the appropriate price to use 
different judgments and assumptions could result in different presentations of value 
we estimate the fair value of our purchased beneficial interests using available market information and other appropriate valuation methodologies 
we believe the estimates we use reflect the market values we may be able to receive should we choose to sell them 
our estimates involve matters of uncertainty  judgment in interpreting relevant market data and are inherently subjective in nature 
many factors are necessary to estimate market values  including  but not limited to  interest rates  prepayment rates  amount and timing of credit losses  supply and demand  liquidity  cash flows and other market factors 
we apply these factors to our portfolio as appropriate  in order to determine market values 
when the fair value of an available for sale security is less than amortized cost  management considers whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
if management determines an other than temporary impairment exists  the cost basis of the security is written down to the then current fair value  and the unrealized loss is recorded as a reduction of current earnings as if the loss had been realized in the period of impairment 
management considers several factors when evaluating securities for an other than temporary impairment  including the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the amortized cost  whether the 
table of contents security has been downgraded by a rating agency and the continued intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
at december   we recognized impairment losses of million in connection with our decision to reposition our spread portfolio as we no longer have the intent to hold the securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
at december   we also recognized impairment losses of million on certain securities in our residential mortgage credit portfolio 
for these securities  management determined that the change in value of the securities was other than temporary because the losses were due to adverse changes in credit or prepayment speeds 
at december   we had unrealized losses on our mortgage backed securities classified as available for sale of million which  if not recovered  may result in the recognition of future losses 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is evaluated at least quarterly 
if future evaluations conclude that impairment is other than temporary  we may need to realize a loss that would have an impact on income 
loans held for investment we purchase pools of residential mortgage loans through our network of origination partners 
mortgage loans are designated as held for investment as we have the intent and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future  and until maturity or payoff 
mortgage loans that are considered to be held for investment are carried at their unpaid principal balances  including unamortized premium or discount  adjustments for unamortized derivative gains and losses during the commitment period and allowance for loan losses 
allowance and provision for loan losses to estimate the allowance for loan losses  we first identify impaired loans 
loans are generally evaluated for impairment individually  but loans purchased on a pooled basis with relatively smaller balances and substantially similar characteristics may be evaluated collectively for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including interest payments 
impaired loans are carried at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
interest income recognition interest income on our mortgage backed securities is accrued based on the coupon rate and the outstanding principal amount of the underlying mortgages 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method adjusted for the effects of estimated prepayments based on sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf   recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
interest income is recognized using the effective yield method 
the prospective method is used for adjusting the level yield used to recognize interest income when estimates of future cash flows over the remaining life of the security either increase or decrease 
cash flows are projected based on management s assumptions for prepayment rates and credit losses 
actual economic conditions may produce cash flows that could differ significantly from projected cash flows  and differences could result in an increase or decrease in the yield used to record interest income or could result in impairment losses 
interest income on our mortgage loans is accrued and credited to income based on the carrying amount and contractual terms or estimated life of the assets using the effective yield method in accordance with sfas no 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due 
when an interest accrual is discontinued  all associated unpaid accrued interest income is reversed against current period operating results 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 

table of contents securitizations we create securitization entities as a means of securing long term collateralized financing for our residential mortgage loan portfolio and matching the income earned on residential mortgage loans with the cost of related liabilities  otherwise referred to a match funding our balance sheet 
residential mortgage loans are transferred to a separate bankruptcy remote legal entity from which private label multi class mortgage backed notes are issued 
on a consolidated basis  securitizations are accounted for as secured financings as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and  therefore  no gain or loss is recorded in connection with the securitizations 
each securitization entity is evaluated in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation  or fin  r  consolidation of variable interest entities  and we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the securitization entities 
as such  the securitization entities are consolidated into our consolidated balance sheet subsequent to securitization 
residential mortgage loans transferred to securitization entities collateralize the mortgage backed notes issued  and  as a result  those investments are not available to us  our creditors or stockholders 
all discussions relating to securitizations are on a consolidated basis and do not necessarily reflect the separate legal ownership of the loans by the related bankruptcy remote legal entity 
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities we are not required to account for derivative contracts using hedge accounting as described below 
effective december   we discontinued the use of hedge accounting 
all future changes in value of hedging instruments that had previously been accounted for under hedge accounting will be recorded in other income or expense and could potentially result in increased volatility in our earnings 
our policies permit us to enter into derivative contracts as a means of mitigating our interest rate risk on forecasted interest expense associated with forecasted rollover reissuance of repurchase agreements or the interest rate repricing of repurchase agreements and the forecasted interest expense associated with forecasted securitization activities  or hedged items  for a future time period 
our policies allow us to enter into eurodollar futures contracts  interest rate swap contracts and interest rate cap contracts 
these hedge instruments may be designated as cash flow hedges and are evaluated at inception and on an ongoing basis in order to determine whether they qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
the hedge instrument must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
hedge instruments are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
any ineffectiveness that arises during the hedging relationship is recognized in interest expense during the period in which it arises 
prior to the end of the specified hedge time period  the effective portion of all contract gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  is recorded in other comprehensive income or loss 
realized gains and losses on hedge instruments are reclassified into earnings as an adjustment to interest expense during the specified hedge time period 
for reit taxable net income purposes  realized gains and losses on hedge instruments are reclassified into earnings immediately when positions are closed or have expired 
we may enter into commitments to purchase mortgage loans  or purchase commitments  from our network of origination partners 
each purchase commitment is evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
to determine whether the purchase commitment meets the definition of a derivative instrument 
purchase commitments that meet the definition of a derivative instrument are recorded at their estimated fair value on the consolidated balance sheet and any change in fair value of the purchase commitment is recognized in other income or expense 
upon settlement of the loan purchase  the purchase commitment derivative is derecognized and included in the cost basis of the loans purchased 
see note to the financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion about accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb posted a staff position  or fsp  to address the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and the measurement of an 
table of contents impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations and apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this fsp also nullifies certain requirements of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  and supersedes eitf topic no 
d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value 
this fsp must be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  this fsp will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb posted fsp sop  terms of loan products that may give rise to a concentration of risk 
this fsp was issued in response to inquiries from constituents and discussions with the sec staff and regulators of financial institutions and is intended to emphasize the requirements to assess the adequacy of disclosures for all lending products including both secured and unsecured loans and the effect of changes in market or economic conditions on the adequacy of those disclosures 
we currently hold loans with certain features that may increase credit risk  including loans with an initial interest rate that is below the market interest rate for the initial period of the loan term and that may increase significantly when that period ends and interest only loans 
the disclosure requirements in this fsp are summarized in two questions 
the guidance to question is effective for interim and annual periods ending after the date the fsp is posted to the fasb website  or december   and question references only existing effective literature  therefore no effective date or transition guidance is required 
this fsp did not have a material impact our financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and this statement provides entities with relief from having to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host contract in accordance with sfas no 
the statement allows an entity to make an irrevocable election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair value in its entirety  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
the election may be made on an instrument by instrument basis and can be made only when a hybrid financial instrument is initially recognized or when certain events occur that constitute a remeasurement ie  new basis event for a previously recognized hybrid financial instrument 
an entity must document its election to measure a hybrid financial instrument at fair value  either concurrently or via a preexisting policy for automatic election 
once the fair value election has been made  that hybrid financial instrument may not be designated as a hedging instrument pursuant to sfas no 
the statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  we are still evaluating the impact of this statement on our financial condition and or results of operations 
accounting treatment for certain investments financed with repurchase agreements we understand that the fasb is considering placing an item on its agenda relating to the treatment of transactions where mortgage backed securities purchased from a particular counterparty are financed via a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty 
currently  we record such assets and the related financing gross on our consolidated balance sheet  and the corresponding interest income and interest expense gross on our consolidated statement of operations 
any change in fair value of the security is reported through other comprehensive income under sfas no 
 because the security is classified as available for sale 
however  in a transaction where the mortgage backed securities are acquired from and financed under a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty  the acquisition may not qualify as a sale from the seller s perspective under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
in such cases  the seller may be required to continue to consolidate the assets sold to us  based on their continuing involvement with such investments 
depending on the ultimate outcome of the fasb deliberations  we may be precluded from presenting the assets gross on our balance sheet and should instead be treating our net investment in such assets as a derivative 

table of contents if it is determined that these transactions should be treated as investments in derivatives  the interest rate swaps entered into by us to hedge our interest rate exposure with respect to the borrowings under the associated repurchase agreements may no longer qualify for hedge accounting  and would then  as with the underlying asset transactions  also be marked to market through the income statement 
this potential change in accounting treatment does not affect the economics of the transactions but does affect how the transactions would be reported in our financial statements 
our cash flows  our liquidity and our ability to pay a dividend would be unchanged  and we do not believe our reit taxable income or reit status would be affected 
our net equity would not be materially affected 
at december   we have identified available for sale securities with a fair value of million which had been purchased from and financed with the same counterparty since their purchase 
if we were to change our current accounting treatment for these transactions at december   total assets and total liabilities would each be reduced by approximately million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  net loss was million  or loss per share  and net income of million  or per share  respectively 
for the same periods  interest income  net of premium amortization  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in interest income as a result of the implementation of our recently developed residential mortgage credit strategy  which includes investments in mortgage backed securities with ratings below aaa and purchases of prime whole loans and securitizations of those loans 
for the years ended december  and the weighted average yield on average earning assets  net of amortization of premium  was and  respectively  and our cost of funds on total liabilities was and  respectively  resulting in a net interest spread of and  respectively 
cost of funds is defined as total interest expense divided by average repurchase agreement liabilities  mortgage backed notes  warehouse lending facilities and junior subordinated notes 
refer to the section titled critical accounting policies for a description of our accounting policy for derivative instruments and hedging activities and the impact on interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively  and was calculated as follows for the year for the year ended percentage ended percentage december  of average december  of average liabilities liabilities in thousands interest expense on repurchase agreement liabilities interest expense on mortgage backed notes interest expense on warehouse lending facilities interest expense on junior subordinated notes net hedge ineffectiveness gains losses on futures and interest rate swap contracts amortization of net realized gains on futures contracts net interest income expense on interest rate swap contracts other nm nm total interest expense 
table of contents nm not meaningful average repurchase agreements  mortgage backed notes  warehouse lending facilities and junior subordinated notes during the years ended december  and  were billion and billion  respectively 
interest expense on repurchase agreement liabilities increased in  as compared to  primarily because of the increase in the average interest rate on those liabilities due to short term borrowing rate increases by the federal reserve board 
during the year ended december   we acquired residential mortgage loans using warehouse lending facilities prior to permanently financing the acquisitions through the issuance of mortgage backed notes 
the interest expense on junior subordinated notes during is the result of the completion of two trust preferred security offerings 
the net hedge ineffectiveness gains recognized in interest expense during the year ended december  is primarily due to an adjustment to the construction of the hypothetical derivative during the three months ended june  in accordance with our sfas no 
accounting policy which is used to measure hedge ineffectiveness on our eurodollar futures contracts 
we changed the term of our forecasted repurchase agreement liabilities to conform more closely to common industry issuance terms 
we do not anticipate further changes to the term of our forecasted repurchase agreement liabilities  and therefore we believe that we will incur no future ineffectiveness from this change 
as required by sfas no 
 we recognized one time gains of million in the form of hedge ineffectiveness on our eurodollar futures contracts during the three months ended june  the impact of this ineffectiveness was that a portion of the liabilities we had hedged in anticipation of rising interest rates was recognized as gains or offsets to our interest expense in the second quarter of the remaining net hedge ineffectiveness gains for the year ended december  relate to our cash flow hedges 
other expense for the year ended december  was thousand  consisting of million of net losses on commitments to purchase loans offset by thousand of net gains due to the change in value of other derivative contracts 
other income for the year ended december  was million  consisting of a one time gain on the termination of certain repurchase agreements that was initiated by our counterparty  the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
at december   we recognized impairment losses on mortgage backed securities of million  primarily in connection with our decision to reposition our spread portfolio 
we did not incur any impairment losses in during the year ended december   we sold million of mortgage backed securities to reduce leverage and rebalance our portfolios 
for the year ended december   we realized a net loss on sales of mortgage backed securities of thousand 
we did not sell any mortgage backed securities during the same period in operating expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
we paid base management compensation and incentive compensation to seneca for the years ended december  and  pursuant to a management agreement 
we entered into an amended agreement with seneca  dated march   which superseded our original management agreement dated june   or prior agreement  and revised the computation of base management compensation and incentive management compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion about the management agreement 
base management compensation to seneca for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
incentive compensation expense to related parties for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in expense is primarily related to the amended agreement noted above 
under the amended agreement  no incentive compensation was earned by seneca during the year ended december  the incentive compensation expense of million for the year ended december  related to restricted common stock awards granted for incentive compensation earned in prior periods that vested during the year 
for the year ended december   total incentive compensation earned by seneca was million  one half payable in cash and one half payable in the form of our common stock 
the cash portion of the incentive compensation of million for the year ended december  was expensed in that period as well as of the restricted common stock portion of the incentive compensation  or thousand 
in 
table of contents accordance with the terms of his employment agreement  our chief financial officer is eligible to earn incentive compensation 
no incentive compensation was earned by our chief financial officer for the year ended december  the remaining incentive compensation expense of million for the year ended december  relates primarily to incentive compensation earned by our chief financial officer and restricted common stock awards vested during the year 
salaries and benefits expense for the years ended december  and was million and thousand  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to increased employee headcount due to the implementation of our portfolio diversification strategy 
professional services expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  and includes legal  accounting and other professional services provided to us 
the increase in professional services expense is primarily due to the implementation of our portfolio diversification strategy 
other general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  were million and million  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the expenses incurred in connection with the implementation of our portfolio diversification strategy  including due diligence  servicing  information technology  recruiting and rent 
year ended december  compared to the period from april  through december  the results of operations for the year ended december   are not comparable to those in primarily due to the substantial asset base growth resulting from our initial public offering and follow on public offering and full year of operations in for the year ended december   net income was million  or per share 
for the same period  interest income  net of premium amortization  was approximately million  and was primarily earned from investments in mortgage backed securities 
interest expense for the year ended december   was million and was primarily due to costs on short term borrowings 
for the period from april  through december   net income was million  or per share 
for the same period  interest income  net of premium amortization  was approximately million  and was primarily earned from investments in mortgage backed securities 
interest expense on short term borrowings was million 
because of the timing of our initial investment of portfolio assets investment activities began on june  as well as the timing of our initial public offering proceeds were received on december   interest income and interest expense for the period from april  through december   was substantially lower than the full year of operations in  both in an absolute sense and also relative to the average net invested assets for the period 
in addition  prepayment activity declined in due to the changing interest rate environment and resulted in decreased premium amortization and increased yield on average earning assets

 we recognized one time gains of million in the form of hedge ineffectiveness on our eurodollar futures contracts during the three months ended june  the impact of this recognition was that a portion of the liabilities we had hedged in anticipation of rising interest rates were recognized as gains or offsets to our interest expense in the second quarter of the remaining net ineffectiveness gains for the year ended december   relate to our cash flow hedges 
no net hedge ineffectiveness gains or losses were recognized in other income of million for the year ended december   represents a one time gain on the termination of certain repurchase agreements that was initiated by our counterparty  federal home loan mortgage corporation 
we had no other income for the period from april  through december  net losses on sales of mortgage backed securities of million are included in net income for the period from april  through december  to reduce leverage  we sold securities in mid august  totaling million and realized a loss of million 
in an attempt to protect our portfolio from further increases in interest rates  we sold short million of tba mortgage securities 
interest rates subsequently declined  and we closed out this short position in the month of september  for a total realized loss of million 
during the third quarter of  we also simultaneously sold and purchased securities totaling million and million  respectively  that resulted in a realized gain on sale of million 
there were no other gains or losses on sales of securities for the period from april  through december  or during the year ended december  operating expenses for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december  were million and million  respectively  for an increase of million 
the increase in operating expenses in is primarily due to a full year of operations versus a partial year in operating 
table of contents expenses in were high in proportion to gross interest income and expense and to net interest income as compared to the same proportions for the full year of operations in  primarily due to start up costs 
for the year ended december   and the period from april  through december   we paid base management compensation and incentive compensation in accordance with the terms of our prior agreement with seneca 
base management compensation to seneca was million and thousand for the year ended december   and the period from april  through december   respectively  based on a percentage of our average net worth 
the increase in base management compensation was primarily due to a full year of operations 
incentive compensation expense to related parties for the year ended december   and the period from april  through december   was million and million  respectively 
under the prior agreement  incentive compensation was earned by related parties when reit taxable net income before deducting incentive compensation  net operating losses and certain other items relative to the average net invested assets for the period  as defined in the agreement  exceeds the threshold return taxable income that would have produced an annualized return on equity equal to the sum of the year us treasury rate plus for the same period 
for the year ended december   total incentive compensation earned by seneca was million  one half payable in cash and one half payable in the form of a restricted common stock award 
the cash portion of the incentive compensation of million for the year ended december   was expensed in that period as well as of the restricted common stock portion of the incentive compensation  or thousand 
for the period from april  through december   total incentive compensation earned by seneca was million  of which thousand was waived by seneca for the quarter ended september  the remaining incentive compensation of thousand was one half payable in cash and one half payable in the form of restricted common stock 
the cash portion of the incentive compensation of thousand for the quarter ended december   was expensed in that period as well as of the restricted common stock portion of the incentive compensation  or thousand 
in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement  our chief financial officer is eligible to earn incentive compensation 
the remaining incentive compensation expense of million for the year ended december   relates primarily to incentive compensation earned by our chief financial officer and restricted common stock awards vested during the year 
the remaining incentive compensation expense of thousand for the period april  through december   relates primarily to incentive compensation earned by our chief financial officer 
salaries and benefits expense for the year ended december   and for the period from april  through december   was thousand and thousand  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to salaries and benefits paid for a full year in  as well as performance bonuses paid in professional services expense for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december   of million and thousand  respectively  includes legal  accounting and other professional services provided to us for the full year as compared to the partial year other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and the period from april  through december   of million and thousand  respectively  includes insurance  custody  board of director  and other general and administrative costs for the full year as compared to the partial year

financial condition all of our assets at december  were acquired with proceeds from both the private placement and public offerings of our common stock  proceeds from our preferred securities offerings and use of leverage 
on february   we entered into a controlled equity offering sales agreement with cantor fitzgerald co  or cantor fitzgerald  through which we may sell common stock or preferred stock from time to time through cantor fitzgerald acting as agent and or principal in privately negotiated and or at the market transactions 
during the year ended december   we sold approximately million shares of common stock pursuant to this agreement and we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in  we completed two trust preferred security offerings in the amount of million 
we received proceeds  net of debt issuance costs  from the preferred securities offering in the amount of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion about the junior subordinated notes 
we established a direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan  effective june   which offers stockholders  or persons who agree to become stockholders  the option to purchase shares of our common stock 
during the year ended december   we issued approximately million shares of common stock through direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment for net proceeds of million 
we announced a stock repurchase program on november  that authorizes us to repurchase up to a total of  of our common shares 
we can repurchase shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time at management s discretion until we repurchase a total of  common shares or our board of directors determines to terminate the program 
through december   we had repurchased  shares at a weighted average price of and were authorized to acquire up to  more common shares 
mortgage backed securities at december   we held billion of mortgage backed securities at fair value  comprised of billion in our spread portfolio and million in our residential mortgage credit portfolio  net of 
table of contents unrealized gains of million and unrealized losses of million 
at december   we held billion of mortgage backed securities at fair value in our spread portfolio  net of unrealized gains of thousand and unrealized losses of million 
the change in mortgage backed securities held is primarily due to the purchase of mortgage backed securities with a cost basis of billion  principal payments of billion  the recognition of impairment losses on mortgage backed securities of million and premium amortization of million during the year ended december  the recognition of impairment losses during the year ended december  caused the mortgage backed securities in our spread portfolio to be marked to a discount to their par value 
we will accrete the discount  which will be recorded as income  over the life of the underlying mortgage backed securities 
at december  and  our total mortgage backed securities portfolio had a weighted average amortized cost  excluding residual interests  of and of face amount  respectively 
at december  and  none of our portfolio consisted of fixed rate mortgage backed securities 
at december   of our mortgage backed securities portfolio was invested in aaa rated non agency backed or agency backed mortgage backed securities and was invested in non agency backed credit sensitive securities with a weighted average credit rating of bbb 
at december   our entire portfolio was invested in aaa rated non agency backed or agency backed mortgage backed securities 
included in the total impairment losses on mortgage backed securities of million were impairment losses of million recorded on our spread portfolio due to our decision to reposition the spread portfolio through the sale of certain mortgage backed securities and accelerate our diversification into higher yielding residential mortgage credit investment strategies 
this asset repositioning marked a change in our intent to hold the mortgage backed securities in the spread portfolio that were in unrealized loss positions for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in fair value 
we determined that the unrealized losses in the spread portfolio at december  were other than temporary impairments as defined in sfas no 
 and therefore we recognized impairment losses in our consolidated statement of operations 
all of the mortgage backed securities in our residential mortgage credit portfolio are accounted for in accordance with eitf under eitf  we evaluate whether there is other than temporary impairment by discounting projected cash flows using our credit  prepayment and other assumptions compared to prior period projections 
if the discounted projected cash flow has decreased and is due to a change in our credit  prepayment and other assumptions  then the mortgage backed security must be written down to market value if the market value is below the amortized cost basis 
if there have been no changes to our assumptions and the change in value is solely due to interest rate changes  the mortgage backed security may not be impaired 
it is difficult to predict the timing or magnitude of these other than temporary impairments  and impairment losses could be substantial 
during the year ended december   we recorded losses due to other than temporary impairments of million in our residential mortgage credit portfolio 
during the year ended december   and the period from april  through december   we did not hold any mortgage backed securities that were accounted for in accordance with eitf at december   we had unrealized losses of million in mortgage backed securities held in our residential mortgage credit portfolio 
the temporary impairment of the available for sale securities results from the fair value of the mortgage backed securities falling below their amortized cost basis and is solely attributed to changes in interest rates 
at december   none of the securities we held had been downgraded by a credit rating agency since their purchase 
we intend and have the ability to hold the securities in our residential mortgage credit portfolio for a period of time  to maturity if necessary  sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in fair value of the securities held 
as such  we do not believe any of the securities held in our residential mortgage credit portfolio at december  are other than temporarily impaired 
the stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our portfolio of mortgage backed securities ranges up to years  however  the expected maturity is subject to change based on the prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans

the prepayment model considers current yield  forward yield  steepness of the yield curve  current mortgage rates  mortgage rate of the outstanding loan  loan age  margin and volatility 
the actual weighted average lives of the mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio could be longer or shorter than the estimates in the tables above depending on the actual prepayment rates experienced over the life of the applicable securities and is sensitive to changes in both prepayment rates and interest rates 
at december  and  and  respectively  of our investment portfolio was invested in hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
assuming constant payment rates  the mortgages underlying our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities at december  and had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months and months  respectively 
the phrase weighted average term to next rate adjustment refers to the average of the periods of time that must elapse before the interest rates adjust for all of the mortgages underlying our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities in our portfolio  which average is weighted in proportion to the book values of the applicable securities 

table of contents the mortgages underlying our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
periodic interest rate caps limit the amount that the interest rate of a mortgage can increase during any given period 
lifetime interest rate caps limit the amount an interest rate can increase through the maturity of a mortgage 
at december  and  and  respectively  of the hybrid adjustable rate securities in our investment portfolio were subject to interest rate caps 
at december   the percentage of hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio that were subject to periodic interest rate caps every six months or annually were and  respectively 
at december   the percentage of hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio that were subject to periodic interest rate caps every six months or annually were and  respectively 
at december  and  the mortgages underlying our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with specific annual caps had average annual caps of and  respectively 
the average lifetime cap was at both december  and the periodic adjustments to the interest rates of the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities are based on changes in an objective index 
substantially all of the mortgages underlying our mortgage backed securities adjust their interest rates based on one of two main indices  the us treasury index  which is a monthly or weekly average yield of benchmark us treasury securities published by the federal reserve board  or the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
the percentages of the mortgages underlying the hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio at december  with interest rates that reset based on the us treasury or libor indices were and  respectively 
the percentages of the mortgages underlying the hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities in our investment portfolio at december  with interest rates that reset based on the us treasury or libor indices were and  respectively 
the principal payment rate on our mortgage backed securities  an annual rate of principal paydowns for our mortgage backed securities relative to the outstanding principal balance of our mortgage backed securities  was and for the three months ended december  and december   respectively 
the principal payment rate attempts to predict the percentage of principal that will paydown over the next months based on historical principal paydowns 
the principal payment rate cannot be considered an indication of future principal repayment rates because actual changes in market interest rates will have a direct impact on the principal prepayments in our portfolio 
at december  and  the weighted average effective duration of the securities in our overall mortgage backed securities portfolio  assuming constant prepayment rates  or cpr  to the balloon or reset date  or the cpb duration  was years and years  respectively 
cpr is a measure of the rate of prepayment for our mortgage backed securities  expressed as an annual rate relative to the outstanding principal balance of our mortgage backed securities 
cpb duration is similar to cpr except that it also assumes that the hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities prepay in full at their next reset date 
loans held for investment during the year ended december   we completed our first acquisition of residential mortgage loans 
at december   our residential mortgage loan portfolio totaled million  including unamortized premium of thousand 
our residential mortgage loans at december  are comprised of adjustable rate mortgage loans that collateralize debt obligations 
we intend to securitize subsequent acquisitions of loans  maintain those loans as held for investment on our consolidated balance sheet and account for securitizations as financings under sfas no 
at december   we had not recorded an allowance for loan losses because none of the loans held in the portfolio were considered impaired

hybrid adjustable rate mortgages have an initial fixed rate period and then the interest rate borne by each mortgage loan will be adjusted annually based on one year libor or one year us treasury  each referred to as the index  computed in accordance with the related note plus the related gross margin  generally subject to rounding and to certain other limitations including a maximum lifetime mortgage rate and in certain cases a maximum upward or downward adjustment on each interest adjustment date 
consistent with characteristics typical of the alt a market  a large segment of this loan portfolio is scheduled to receive interest only payments during the initial fixed rate period and a large segment was underwritten under either a reduced or limited documentation program 
securitizations during the year ended december   we completed our first securitization or sale of mortgage backed notes and accounted for the transaction as a financing under sfas no 
securitization means selling the rights to payment provided by our mortgage ownership under our loans held for investment in the form of collateralized bonds called mortgage backed notes to investors 
at december   we carried million of mortgage backed notes as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
residential mortgage loans that collateralize debt obligations are loans we have securitized into sequentially rated classes  with the lower rated classes providing credit support for aaa and aa certificates issued to third party investors in structured financing arrangements 
we intend to securitize subsequent acquisitions of loans  maintain those loans held for investment on our consolidated balance sheet and account for securitizations as financings under sfas no 
other assets we had other assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
other assets at december  consist primarily of interest receivable of million  principal receivable of million  derivatives contracts of million  common stock investments in subsidiary trusts of million  deferred debt issue costs of million and a common stock investment in a reit of million 
other assets at december  consist primarily of interest receivable of million  principal receivable of million  derivatives contracts of million and deferred compensation of thousand 
the increase in interest receivable at december  compared to december  is primarily due to the change in the composition of our portfolio of mortgage assets during the year and the corresponding increase in interest income 
debt issue costs incurred during relate to our issuance of mortgage backed notes and trust preferred security offerings 
hedging instruments hedging involves risk and typically involves costs  including transaction costs 
the costs of hedging can increase as the period covered by the hedging increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates 
we may increase our hedging activity and  thus  increase our hedging costs during such periods when interest rates are volatile or rising 
we generally intend to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as we determine is in the best interest of our stockholders  after considering the cost of such hedging transactions and our desire to maintain our status as a reit 
our policies do not contain specific requirements as to the percentages or amount of interest rate risk that we are required to hedge 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
moreover  no hedging activity can completely insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates and prepayment rates 
at december  and  we have engaged in short sales of eurodollar futures contracts as a means of mitigating our interest rate risk on forecasted interest expense associated with the benchmark rate on forecasted rollover reissuance of repurchase agreements or the interest rate repricing of repurchase agreements and the forecasted interest expense on long term floating rate debt expected to be issued through securitization activities 
at december   we had short positions on  eurodollar futures contracts  with expiration dates ranging from march  to march the total notional amount of the contracts was billion 
the value of eurodollar futures contracts is marked to market daily in our margin account with the custodian 
based upon the 
table of contents daily market value of eurodollar futures contracts  we either receive funds into  or wire funds into  our margin account with the custodian to ensure that an appropriate margin account balance is maintained at all times through the expiration of the contracts 
at december   we had short positions on  eurodollar futures contracts  with expiration dates ranging from march to march the total notional amount of the contracts was billion 
at december  and december   the fair value of the eurodollar futures contracts was million recorded in assets and million recorded in liabilities  respectively 
at december  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to mitigate our interest rate risk associated with the benchmark rate on forecasted rollover reissuance of repurchase agreements or the interest rate repricing of repurchase agreements for the period defined by maturity of the interest rate swap 
cash flows that occur each time the swap is repriced are associated with forecasted interest expense for a specified future period  which is defined as the calendar period preceding each repricing date with the same number of months as the repricing frequency 
at december  and december   the current notional amount of interest rate swap contracts totaled million and billion  respectively  and the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts at those dates was million and million  respectively  recorded in assets 
counterparties to our interest rate swap contracts are well known financial institutions and default risk is considered low 
we have outstanding swaption contracts and interest rate cap contracts at december  that were not designated as hedges under sfas no 
the contracts are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of the contracts at december  was million 
at december   we had not entered into any swaption contracts or interest rate cap contracts 
repurchase agreements we have entered into repurchase agreements to finance some of our acquisitions of mortgage backed securities and the retained tranches of mortgage backed notes issued by us 
none of the counterparties to these agreements are affiliates of seneca or us 
these agreements are secured by our mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans and bear interest at rates that have historically priced in close relationship to libor 
at december   we had established borrowing arrangements with various investment banking firms and other lenders  of which were in use on december  at december   we had outstanding billion of repurchase agreements with a weighted average current borrowing rate of  billion of which matures within days  million of which matures between and days and billion of which matures in greater than days 
at december   we had outstanding billion of repurchase agreements with a weighted average current borrowing rate of  million of which matured within days  billion of which matured between and days and billion of which matured in greater than days 
the decrease in outstanding repurchase agreements is primarily due to the use of cash flows from principal and interest payments to repay repurchase agreement liabilities 
it is our present intention to seek to renew the repurchase agreements outstanding as they mature under the then applicable borrowing terms of the counterparties to our repurchase agreements 
at december  and  the repurchase agreements were secured by mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans with an estimated fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
the net amount at risk  defined as the sum of the fair value of securities sold plus accrued interest income and the fair value of mortgage loans pledged as collateral  minus the sum of repurchase agreement liabilities plus accrued interest expense  with all counterparties was million and million at december  and  respectively 
mortgage backed notes we create securitization entities as a means of securing long term collateralized financing for our residential mortgage loan portfolio matching the income earned on residential mortgage loans with the cost of related liabilities  otherwise referred to a match funding our balance sheet 
we may use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps to achieve this 
residential mortgage loans are transferred to a separate bankruptcy remote legal entity from which private label multi class mortgage backed notes are issued 
on a consolidated basis  securitizations are accounted for as secured financings as defined by sfas no 
and  therefore  no gain or loss is recorded in connection with the securitizations 
each securitization entity is evaluated in accordance with fin r and we 
table of contents have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the securitization entities 
as such  the securitization entities are consolidated into our consolidated balance sheet subsequent to securitization 
residential mortgage loans transferred to securitization entities collateralize the mortgage backed notes issued  and  as a result  those investments are not available to us  our creditors or stockholders 
the securitization completed in is considered to be a financing for both gaap and tax purposes 
all discussions relating to securitizations are on a consolidated basis and do not necessarily reflect the separate legal ownership of the loans by the related bankruptcy remote legal entity 
during the fourth quarter of  we issued approximately million of mortgage backed notes 
we retained million of the resulting securities for our securitized residential loan portfolio and placed million with third party investors 
of the securities retained  were rated investment grade and were rated less than investment grade 
all of the mortgage backed notes issued were priced with interest indexed to one month libor 
each series of mortgage backed notes that we issued consisted of various classes of securities that bear interest at varying spreads to the underlying interest rate index 
the maturity of each class of securities is directly affected by the rate of principal repayments on the associated residential mortgage loan collateral 
as a result  the actual maturity of each series of mortgage backed notes may be shorter than its stated maturity 
at december   we had mortgage backed notes with an outstanding balance of million dollars and with a weighted average borrowing rate of per annum 
the borrowing rates of the mortgage backed notes reset monthly based on libor 
unpaid interest on the mortgage backed notes was thousand at december  the stated maturities of the mortgage backed notes at december  were at december   residential mortgage loans with an estimated fair value of million were pledged as collateral for mortgage backed notes issued 
warehouse lending facilities during  we entered into warehouse lending facilities to finance our residential mortgage loan acquisitions prior to securitization 
these warehouse lending facilities are short term borrowings that are secured by the loans and bear interest based on libor 
in general  the warehouse lending facilities provide financings for loans for a maximum of days 
at december   our borrowing capacity under warehouse lending facilities was billion 
no amounts were outstanding under the warehouse lending facilities at december  we had no warehouse lending facilities in junior subordinated notes on march and december   we issued junior subordinated notes to our wholly owned subsidiaries  diana statutory trust i and diana statutory trust ii  in the combined amount of million 
at december   thousand of interest was unpaid on the junior subordinated notes 
see note to the financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion about the junior subordinated notes 
margin debt we have a margin lending facility with our primary custodian from which we may borrow money in connection with the purchase or sale of securities 
the terms of the borrowings  including the rate of interest payable  are agreed to with the custodian for each amount borrowed 
borrowings are repayable immediately upon demand by the custodian 
at december   we had an outstanding balance against this borrowing facility of million at a rate of 
no borrowings were outstanding under the margin lending facility at december  after consideration of the terms of our eurodollar futures and interest rate swap contracts  the weighted average days to rate reset of our total liabilities was days and days at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the weighted average days to rate reset of our total liabilities is primarily attributed to the use of interest rate swap contracts to hedge the impact of changes in interest rates on our liability costs 

table of contents other liabilities we had million and million of other liabilities at december  and  respectively 
other liabilities at december  consisted primarily of million of accrued interest expense on repurchase agreements  mortgage backed notes  junior subordinated notes and interest rate swap contracts  million of cash distribution payable  million of accounts payable and other accrued expenses  and million of management compensation payable and other related party liabilities

weighted average stockholders equity for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
return on average equity for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
return on average equity is defined as net income loss divided by weighted average stockholders equity 
the negative return on average equity for the year ended december  was primarily due to the impairment losses on mortgage backed securities of million recorded in connection with our decision to reposition our spread portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds at december  consisted of repurchase agreements totaling billion with a weighted average current borrowing rate of  which we used to finance acquisition of mortgage backed securities 
we expect to continue to borrow funds in the form of repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established borrowing arrangements with various investment banking firms and other lenders  of which were in use on december  increases in short term interest rates could negatively impact the valuation of our mortgage backed securities  which could limit our borrowing ability or cause our lenders to initiate margin calls 
amounts due upon maturity of our repurchase agreements will be funded primarily through the rollover reissuance of repurchase agreements and monthly principal and interest payments received on our mortgage backed securities 
at december   the primary source of funding via our residential mortgage loan portfolio was a million warehouse lending facility with morgan stanley bank  in the form of a repurchase agreement that was established in august  as well as a million warehouse lending facility with bear stearns mortgage capital corporation that was established in october we had no outstanding borrowings on either of these warehouse lending facilities at december  during january  we established a billion warehouse lending facility with greenwich financial products  inc we acquire residential mortgage loans for our portfolio with the intention of securitizing them and retaining the securitized mortgage loans in our portfolio to match the income we earn on our mortgage assets with the cost of our related liabilities  also referred to as match funding our balance sheet 
in order to facilitate the securitization or financing of our loans  we will generally create subordinate certificates  providing a specified amount of credit enhancement  which we intend to retain in our portfolio 
proceeds from securitizations will be used to pay down the outstanding balance of our warehouse lending facilities 
on november   we issued million of securities consisting of a series of private label multi class mortgage backed securities  lum we retained million of the resulting securities for our securitized residential mortgage loan portfolio and placed million with third party investors  thereby providing long term collateralized financing for its assets 
at december   we had mortgage backed notes totaling 
table of contents million with a weighted average borrowing rate of per annum 
the borrowing rates of the mortgage backed notes reset monthly based on libor 
we have a margin lending facility with our primary custodian from which we may borrow money in connection with the purchase or sale of securities 
the terms of the borrowings  including the rate of interest payable  are agreed to with the custodian for each amount borrowed 
borrowings are repayable upon demand by the custodian 
at december   we had an outstanding balance against this borrowing facility of million at a rate of 
no borrowings were outstanding under the margin lending facility at december  in  we completed two trust preferred security offerings in the aggregate amount of million  providing long term financing for our balance sheet 
we received proceeds  net of debt issuance costs  from the preferred securities offering in the amount of million 
we employ a leverage strategy to increase our investment assets by borrowing against existing mortgage related assets and using the proceeds to acquire additional mortgage related assets 
we generally seek to maintain an overall borrowing leverage between eight to times the amount of our equity  including securitizations consummated as financings 
we establish leverage ratio targets for each of our investment strategies 
specifically  our targeted leverage ratio range for the mortgage backed securities in our spread strategy portfolio is between eight and times and the targeted leverage ratio range for the residential mortgage loans in our residential mortgage credit portfolio is between and times 
at december   the overall borrowing leverage for our entire portfolio was times 
for liquidity  we also rely on cash flows from operations  primarily monthly principal and interest payments to be received on our mortgage backed securities  as well as any primary securities offerings authorized by our board of directors 
on may   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on april  on august   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on july  on november   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on october  on january   we paid a cash distribution of per share to our stockholders of record on december  these distributions are taxable dividends and not considered a return of capital 
we did not distribute million of our reit taxable net income for the year ended december  we intend to declare a spillback distribution in this amount during we did not distribute million of our reit taxable net income for the year ended december  we declared a spillback distribution in this amount during we believe that equity capital  combined with the cash flows from operations  securitizations and the utilization of borrowings  will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated liquidity requirements 
however  an increase in interest rates substantially above our expectations could cause a liquidity shortfall 
if our cash resources are at any time insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may be required to liquidate mortgage related assets or sell debt or additional equity securities 
if required  the sale of mortgage related assets at prices lower than the carrying value of such assets could result in losses and reduced income

we may increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of equity and debt securities  possibly including classes of preferred stock  common stock  commercial paper  medium term notes  collateralized mortgage obligations and senior or subordinated notes 
such financings will depend on market conditions for capital raises and for the investment of any net proceeds therefrom 
all debt securities  other borrowings and classes of preferred stock will be senior to our common stock in any liquidation by us 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more so than inflation does 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and our distributions are determined by our board of directors primarily based on our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary components of our market risk are credit risk and interest rate risk as described below 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we do seek to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake or to which we are exposed 
credit risk we are subject to credit risk is connection with our investments in residential mortgage loans and credit sensitive mortgage backed securities rated below aaa 
the credit risk related to these investments pertains to the ability of the borrower and willingness to pay  which is assessed before credit is granted or renewed and periodically revised throughout the loan or security term 
we use a comprehensive credit review process 
our analysis of loans includes borrower profiles  as well as valuation and appraisal data 
our resources included sophisticated industry and rating agency software  as well as outsourced underwriting services to identify higher risk loans  either due to borrower credit profile or collateral valuation issues 
through statistical sampling techniques  we create adverse credit and valuation samples  which we review by hand 
we reject loans which fail to conform to our standards 
we also create samples of loans with layered risk characteristics  such as investor occupancy and cash out  and review their constituent loans in detail 
we accept only those loans which meet our careful underwriting criteria 
once we own a loan  our surveillance process includes ongoing analysis through our proprietary data warehouse and servicer files 
we are proactive in our analysis of payment behavior and in loss mitigation through our servicing relationships 
we are also subject to credit risk in connection with our investments in mortgage backed securities in our spread portfolio  which is mitigated by holding securities that are either guaranteed by government or government sponsored agencies or have credit ratings of aaa 
concentration risk inadequate diversification of our loan portfolio  such as geographic regions  may result in losses 
as part of our underwriting process  we diversify the geographic concentration risk exposure in our residential loan portfolio purchases 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  residential mortgage loans and our related debt obligations  which are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration that are periodically refinanced at current market rates and warehouse lending facilities  and our derivative contracts 

table of contents effect on net interest income we primarily fund our investments in hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with short term borrowings under repurchase agreements 
during periods of rising interest rates  the borrowing costs associated with those hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities tend to increase while the income earned on such hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities during the fixed rate component of such securities may remain substantially unchanged 
this effect results in a narrowing of the net interest spread between the related assets and borrowings and may even result in losses 
as a means to mitigate the negative impact of a rising interest rate environment  we have entered into derivative transactions  specifically eurodollar futures contracts  interest rate swap contracts and swaption contracts 
hedging techniques are based  in part  on assumed levels of prepayments of our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
if prepayments are slower or faster than assumed  the life of the mortgage backed securities will be longer or shorter  which would reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may utilize and may result in losses on such transactions 
hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns 
our hedging activity is also limited by the asset and sources of income requirements applicable to us as a reit 
extension risk we invest in hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have interest rates that are fixed for the first few years of the loan typically three  five  seven or years and thereafter their interest rates reset periodically on the same basis as adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
at december   of our mortgage backed securities portfolio was comprised of hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities 
we compute the projected weighted average life of our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities based on the market s assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgages 
in general  when a hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed security is acquired with borrowings  we may  but are not required to  enter into an interest rate swap agreement or other hedging instrument that effectively fixes our borrowing costs for a period close to the anticipated average life of the fixed rate portion of the related mortgage backed security 
this strategy is designed to protect us from rising interest rates because the borrowing costs are fixed for the duration of the fixed rate portion of the related mortgage backed security 
however  if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  the life of the fixed rate portion of the related mortgage backed security could extend beyond the term of the swap agreement or other hedging instrument 
this situation could negatively impact us as our borrowing costs would no longer be fixed after the end of the hedging instrument while the income earned on the hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed security would remain fixed 
this situation may also cause the market value of our hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities to decline with little or no offsetting gain from the related hedging transactions 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets and incur losses to maintain adequate liquidity 
interest rate cap risk we also invest in residential mortgage loans and adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities that are based on mortgages that are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps 
these caps limit the amount by which these investments interest yield may change during any given period 
however  our borrowing costs pursuant to our repurchase agreements are not subject to similar restrictions 
therefore  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation by caps  while the interest rate yields on our investments in residential mortgage loans and adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities would effectively be limited by caps 
this problem will be magnified to the extent we acquire adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities that are not based on mortgages that are fully indexed 
in addition  the underlying mortgages may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
the presence of caps could result in our receipt of less cash income on our residential mortgage loans adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities than we need in order to pay the interest cost on our related borrowings 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents interest rate mismatch risk we fund a substantial portion of our acquisitions of adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of somewhat shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of the mortgage backed securities 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between our mortgage assets and liabilities 
therefore  our cost of funds would likely rise or fall more quickly than would our earnings rate on assets 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
to mitigate interest rate mismatches  we may utilize hedging strategies discussed above and in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
our analysis of risks is based on management s experience  estimates  models and assumptions 
these analyses rely on models that utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our manager for our spread portfolio may produce results that differ significantly from our expectations 
prepayment risk prepayments are the full or partial repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a mortgage loan and typically occur due to refinancing of mortgage loans 
prepayment rates for mortgage backed securities generally increase when prevailing interest rates fall below the market rate existing when the underlying mortgages were originated 
in addition  prepayment rates on adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage backed securities generally increase when the difference between long term and short term interest rates declines or becomes negative 
prepayments of mortgage backed securities could harm our results of operations in several ways 
some adjustable rate mortgages underlying our adjustable rate mortgage backed securities may bear initial teaser interest rates that are lower than their fully indexed rate  which refers to the applicable index rates plus a margin 
in the event that such an adjustable rate mortgage is prepaid prior to or soon after the time of adjustment to a fully indexed rate  the holder of the related mortgage backed security would have held such security while it was less profitable and lost the opportunity to receive interest at the fully indexed rate over the expected life of the adjustable rate mortgage backed security 
although we currently do not own any adjustable rate mortgage backed securities with teaser rates  we may obtain some in the future that would expose us to this prepayment risk 
in addition  we currently own mortgage backed securities that were purchased at a premium 
the prepayment of such mortgage backed securities at a rate faster than anticipated would result in a write off of any remaining capitalized premium amount and a consequent reduction of our net interest income by such amount 
finally  in the event that we are unable to acquire new mortgage backed securities to replace the prepaid mortgage backed securities  our financial condition  cash flow and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
effect on fair value another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of our investments  liabilities and our interest rate hedge instruments 
we are exposed to the risk that the market value of our investments will increase or decrease at different rates from those of our liabilities and our interest rate hedge instruments 
we primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the duration of our investments  liabilities and interest rate hedge instruments 
duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change 
we generally calculate duration using various financial models and empirical data 
different models and methodologies can produce different duration numbers for the same financial instruments

nm not meaningful 
table of contents it is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on fair value can change significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points from current levels 
therefore  the volatility in the fair value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond basis points 
in addition  other factors impact the fair value of our interest rate sensitive investments and hedging instruments  such as the shape of the yield curve  market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions 
accordingly  in the event of changes in actual interest rates  the change in the fair value of our assets would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders 
risk management to the extent consistent with maintaining our status as a reit  we seek to manage our interest rate risk exposure to protect our portfolio of mortgage backed securities and related debt against the effects of major interest rate changes 
we generally seek to manage our interest rate risk by monitoring and adjusting  if necessary  the reset index and interest rate related to our mortgage backed securities and our borrowings  attempting to structure our borrowing agreements to have a range of different maturities  terms  amortizations and interest rate adjustment periods  using derivatives  financial futures  swaps  options  caps  floors and forward sales to adjust the interest rate sensitivity of our mortgage backed securities and our borrowings  and actively managing  on an aggregate basis  the interest rate indices  interest rate adjustment periods and gross reset margins of our mortgage backed securities and the interest rate indices and adjustment periods of our borrowings
