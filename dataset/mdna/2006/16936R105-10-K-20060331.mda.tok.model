the steady increase of sales of steering gears  one of the company s principal products in during  the chinese government implemented macroeconomic adjustment and control measures 
banks tightened consumer credit  thus cooled down the light duty vehicle and vehicle market  as they were partly supported by consumer credit 
as one of the parts suppliers to light duty vehicle and car makers  the company s sales of steering gears for light duty vehicles and cars also suffered by dropping in under such disadvantaged situation  the management made adjustments  shifted the company s priorities to truck related products and established a special team to develop the truck market

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation and currency matters in the most recent decade  the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid economic growth as well as relatively high rates of inflation  which in turn has resulted in the periodic adoption by the chinese government of various corrective measures designed to regulate growth and contain inflation 
foreign operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business abroad  including price and currency exchange controls  and fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
the company conducts virtually all of its business in china and  accordingly  the sale of its products is settled primarily in rmb 
as a result  devaluation or currency fluctuation of the rmb against the us would adversely affect the company s financial performance when measured in us dollars 
until  the renminbi experienced a significant devaluation against us dollars but since then the value of the renminbi relative to the us dollar has remained stable 
in addition  the renminbi is not readily convertible into us dollars or other foreign currencies 
all foreign exchange transactions continue to take place either through the bank of china or other banks authorized to buy and sell foreign currencies at the exchange rate quoted by the people s bank of china 
credit risk the company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  and accounts receivable from customers 
cash and cash equivalents are maintained with major state owned banks in the prc 
the management has not evaluated the credit risk from banks based on its notion that state owned banks command considerable funds with good reputation 
the company s business activity is primarily with customers in the prc 
the company periodically performs credit analysis and monitors the financial condition of its clients in order to minimize credit risk 
there is no assurance that these measures will be completely effective 
we have approximately  of accounts receiveable as of december   the company s revenues and or operating cash flow would be materially and adversely affected if there is a allowance for doubtful accounts which led to approximately  to the company 
currency exchange rate risk the company s currency exchange rate risks consist primarily of currency from financing 
the company s financing activities were settled in us dollars and deposited in its bank account in us dollars  while the company conducts virtually all of its business and investment activity in china and the value of our business is effectively denominated in renminbi 
the company will convert us dollars into rmb to conduct its investment activities and business 
the company does not hedge its rmb us dollar exchange rate exposure 
the company has dollar holdings of approximately  as for march   if the exchange rate between us dollars and rmb were to increase by  we would potentially suffer loss by approximately  therefore  we will choose to reduce our exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures when considered appropriate 
risk of inventory prices the risk of inventory prices of the company comes from the upward movement in prices of raw materials and downward movement of selling price 
management believes the latter one is more material 
for recent years  the price fluctuation on raw materials was not so great  but the price on steerings had fluctuated significantly 
during the years to  the prices on steerings has decreased at approximately each year on an average basis 
in the year  the output and sales of domestic commercial vehicles has decreased greatly as compared to  as a result of a number of the government s influence on rectifying the over sized and over loaded of the commercial vehicles market  the adjustment of the real estate and coal markets by the government 
jiulong  one of the joint ventures of the company  as a supplier of commercial vehicles  also suffered from that 
as of december   jiulong s inventory amount was about  during  if the selling price of steering decreases by  the income of the company will decrease by  in the year  the company will take two measures as follows to decrease the inventory at a reasonable level  thus decreasing the risk of inventory prices 
further develop the market in order to use up the finished good from more sales 
better organize all kinds of information  adjust the inventory from various warehouse  and avoid unnecessary production
