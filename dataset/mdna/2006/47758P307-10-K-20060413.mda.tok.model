this discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in this form k 
in addition  the financial information presented for years prior to fiscal have been reclassified for certain amounts to conform to the current year presentation 
overview we are the nation s largest specialty retailer of fabrics and one of the largest specialty retailers of crafts  serving customers in their pursuit of apparel and craft sewing  crafting  home decorating and other creative endeavors 
our retail stores operating as jo ann fabrics and crafts traditional stores and jo ann superstores feature a variety of competitively priced merchandise used in sewing  crafting and home decorating projects  including fabrics  notions  yarn  crafts  frames  paper crafting material  artificial and dried flowers  home accents  finished seasonal and home d cor merchandise 
we continue to transition our store base by replacing our existing traditional stores with superstores 
during we expect to open stores  of which will be new superstore openings  compared with superstore openings during fiscal our research has demonstrated that our customers have a better perception of the quality and pricing of our products when they are presented in our superstore format 
we believe that our prototype  square foot superstore gives us a competitive advantage in the industry 
our superstores provide a unique shopping experience by offering a full creative selection sewing  crafting  framing  seasonal  floral and home d cor accessories all under one roof 
on average  we close traditional stores for every superstore that we open 
our superstores typically average over three times the revenues of the traditional stores they replace 
in markets where we have opened multiple superstores  we have grown our revenues significantly and  we believe  expanded the market size and our market share 
as of january   we operated stores in states traditional stores and superstores 
our traditional stores offer a complete selection of fabric and a convenience assortment of crafts  floral  finished seasonal and home d cor merchandise 
our traditional stores average  square feet and generated net sales per store of approximately million in fiscal our superstores offer an expanded and more comprehensive product assortment than our traditional stores 
our superstores also offer custom framing and educational programs that our traditional stores do not 
our superstores that opened prior to fiscal average approximately  square feet and generated net sales per store of approximately million in fiscal our current superstore prototype is approximately  square feet 
we opened of these prototype superstores in fiscal and we currently have of the prototype superstores in operation as of january  forty three of the prototype superstores have been open at least one year and averaged million in net sales in fiscal we review and manage to a number of key indicators in evaluating financial performance  the most significant of which are net sales  including same store sales by our two store formats  traditional stores and superstores 
net sales measure our overall sales growth and same store sales measure whether our existing stores continue to grow their sales volume 
we also closely monitor per transaction average ticket value and customer transactions  both in total and by store format 
these indicators help measure our effectiveness in attracting customers into our stores and the effectiveness of our product assortment  promotions and service on sales 
we also measure our sales per square foot performance in both of our store formats and compare them with our immediate competitors 
gross margin rate to sales 
in addition  gross margin return on investment gmroi is used by our merchandising organization to evaluate the gross margin performance relative to the average inventory investment 
merchandise selection and future decisions are  in part  based on the gmroi performance 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense as a rate to sales 
we also compare operating margins to those of our competitors 
inventory turnover 
we closely monitor our inventory investment  which is our single largest invested asset 
increasing inventory turnover is critical to improving our working capital position and improving our overall gmroi 
debt to total capitalization 
we monitor our debt balances and leverage as a percent of total capitalization 
we also monitor current and projected excess availability  as defined under our senior bank credit facility  in order to ensure that adequate flexibility is available to execute our operating plans 
executive overview of fiscal fiscal was a challenging year compared with the prior year  as the retail environment experienced softness throughout the year 
the primary source of our softness was the home decorating portions of our business  such as finished seasonal  floral and home d cor merchandise  as well as home decorating textiles 
the quilting and apparel fabrics portions of our business have softened as well  particularly in the third and fourth quarters 
our sales performance for the year was extremely disappointing  and occurred despite an increased level of marketing events and advertising  as well as more aggressive promotional pricing 
summarized below are key performance statistics  by quarter  which indicate the business performance deterioration as the year progressed 
qtr qtr qtr qtr total net sales same store sales percent change gross margin gross margin percent gross margin basis point change from prior year selling  general and administrative expenses sg a percent to sales sg a basis point change from prior year an overview of our fiscal performance follows net sales increased percent to billion due to the impact of new superstore openings 
net sales from stores open one year or more same store sales decreased percent versus a percent same store sales increase for last year 
our average ticket increased percent for fiscal  but was more than offset by a decline in customer transactions 
our gross margin rate  as a percentage of sales  declined by basis points  to percent of net sales in fiscal versus percent for fiscal gross margin rate deterioration has occurred across all product categories in our business and was more significant during the third and fourth quarters 
this is due to a more price focused environment  an increased level of coupon assisted sales  and an increased level of promotional and clearance activity compared to a year ago  in an effort to sell through excess inventories 
our selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of sales  excluding those expenses separately identified in the statement of operations  increased basis points from percent last year to percent this year 
the reduced leverage stemmed from essentially flat same store sales performance  coupled with higher advertising spending  logistics costs  and increases in store expenses  primarily caused by the fixed costs related to the year over year increase in the superstore base  as well as normal inflationary increases in operating expenses 
sg a includes stock based compensation expense of million in fiscal  compared with million in the prior year 
the reduced expense is attributable to a reduced expectation regarding 
table of contents the level of performance based shares that may be earned under the restricted stock program  based on our operating performance  resulting in the reversal of performance based expense that had been previously recorded 
in addition  stock based compensation was credited for expense that had been recognized related to unvested stock awards for executives who left our company 
store pre opening and closing costs increased million to million in fiscal  due to the increased level of real estate activity year over year 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded a charge of million to write off the balance of goodwill that we had carried on our books related to a previous acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we conducted our annual impairment testing 
as a result of the evaluation  we determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and that a full impairment of goodwill existed 
this impairment conclusion was reached considering our market capitalization  declining business trends in our industry  deteriorating performance  particularly in our seasonally significant fourth quarter  and our assessment of the company s near term future performance 
net loss for the year was million  or loss per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in fiscal as described above  results for fiscal include a non cash and non tax deductible charge of million for goodwill impairment 
results for fiscal include debt repurchase costs which reduced pre tax income by million 
during fiscal year we opened of our  square foot prototype superstores and four traditional stores 
we closed traditional stores during fiscal recent developments and business update during fiscal a number of executive officers left our company 
on november   we announced that we were separating the role of chairman from that of president and chief executive officer and commenced a search for a president and chief executive officer 
on february   we announced that in order to attract a broader pool of experienced candidates the new president and chief executive officer would also assume the chairman position and that our current chairman  president and chief executive officer  alan rosskamm  will step down from these positions and become an outside director upon the naming of his successor 
an executive search firm has been retained and is conducting the search for a chairman  president and chief executive officer 
following the appointment of a chief executive officer  we expect to complete searches for a chief financial officer and head merchant 
we expect fiscal to be a year of transition as we implement our repair plan initiatives described below 
we anticipate a challenging first half of the year  but we expect to be positioned for substantial improvement in our operational and financial performance in the second half of the year  as a result of the execution of our repair plan initiatives and significant merchandise assortment changes in our superstores 
we believe that the execution of the repair plan will enable us to finish the year as a stronger  more disciplined organization with a much improved inventory position and lower outstanding debt balances 
each of the major repair plan initiatives is addressed below 
inventory reduction 
we are aggressively promoting clearance merchandise and those categories where we are carrying excess inventory 
we also have taken steps to reduce the number of weeks of supply on hand of many of our basic product categories  and are reducing purchase commitments for fiscal adjustment of store merchandise assortments 
we expect to reduce space and inventory investment in under performing categories such as finished seasonal and home d cor  while emphasizing better performing product categories  such as craft components 
gross margin rate restoration 
we expect to improve our overall advertising and marketing effectiveness  be more discrete with coupons  and take steps to reduce clearance through tighter purchasing disciplines 
we also anticipate being more disciplined by eliminating excessive in season promotional discounts 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense reduction 
we are aggressively reviewing all areas of our business for opportunities to reduce and control expenses 
the following are the major expense reduction and control opportunities 
advertising spending 
our fiscal budget is comparable to fiscal increased costs per advertising event  driven by our increased number of superstore markets  will be offset by a reduced number of advertising events 
distribution center costs 
completion of our new distribution center in opelika  alabama  which began operations in april  will improve efficiencies in the distribution and logistics network starting in the second half of the year 
inventory purchases are being significantly reduced  inventory flow will be managed closer to need  and the addition of the third distribution center will reduce freight costs 
we also expect to reduce outside storage costs and associated logistics inefficiencies as we sell through excess inventory 
workforce reduction 
in mid january  we completed a workforce reduction of certain administrative personnel 
a total of positions were eliminated  consisting of terminations and eliminations of positions that we will not fill 
in addition  we are aggressively challenging positions as employees leave the company  and have identified additional positions that will not be filled 
on february   we completed an amendment of our senior bank credit facility the credit facility 
we increased the credit facility from million to million 
the term of the credit facility remains unchanged  extending through april the amendment  among other things  also improved advance rates on inventory during peak borrowing periods and modified the consolidated net worth covenant 
the amendment is discussed further below under liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations the following table sets forth the financial information through operating loss profit  expressed as a percentage of net sales 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
fiscal year ended jan  jan  jan  net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses store pre opening and closing costs depreciation and amortization debt repurchase and share reclassification expenses goodwill impairment operating loss profit comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased percent to billion from billion in the prior year 
same store sales decreased percent compared with a same store sales increase of percent for fiscal we operated fewer stores in fiscal versus a year ago 
our total store count at the end of the year was down stores  however  the number of superstores in operation increased to from in fiscal total store square footage increased from million square feet at the end of fiscal  to million square feet at the end of fiscal superstores accounted for approximately percent of total net sales during fiscal compared with approximately percent of total net sales for fiscal by store format  our same store sales performance for traditional stores decreased percent versus a same store sales increase of percent for fiscal same store sales for superstores decreased 
table of contents percent versus a same store sales increase of percent for the prior year 
in both store formats  lower customer transactions were the driver of the sales decline  offset slightly by a higher average ticket 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized million of pre tax income related to gift card breakage  which is included in net sales 
this gift card breakage was determined based on the historical redemption patterns of our gift cards and represents the remaining balance of our liability for gift cards for which the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
the fourth quarter of fiscal year was the first period in which we recognized gift card breakage using this methodology which resulted in an adjustment for breakage income related to gift cards sold since fiscal we expect gift card breakage income to be less than million for fiscal on a category basis  our hardlines business  defined as all of our non sewing categories  represented percent of our fiscal sales volume 
the combined hardline categories increased percent on a same store sales basis 
within hardlines  our core craft categories continued to generate solid same store sales increases 
key craft categories generating this growth were paper crafting  yarn  jewelry and kids crafts 
however  the paper crafting and yarn categories rate of growth declined significantly during the fourth quarter 
tempering some of the growth in hardlines was the performance of our finished seasonal  home accents and floral categories 
these categories were down approximately percent on a same store sales basis 
our softlines business  or sewing related categories  represented percent of our fiscal sales volume  and decreased percent on a same store sales basis 
the softness in this area was concentrated in home decorating textiles  although quilting and apparel fabrics have also softened  particularly in the third and fourth quarters 
gross margin 
gross margins may not be comparable to those of our competitors and other retailers 
some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales  while we exclude a portion of them from gross margin  including those costs instead within sg a 
as a percent of net sales  gross margin was percent for fiscal compared with percent in the prior year  an overall decrease of basis points 
the decrease is attributable to a more price focused industry environment  our decision to price more promotionally to reduce inventory  an increased level of coupon related sales and higher markdowns related to clearance activity in the categories that have continued to perform poorly 
our gross margin rate deterioration has been experienced across all product categories in our business  and accelerated significantly in the third and fourth quarters 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses include store and administrative payroll  employee benefits  stock based compensation  distribution costs  store occupancy costs  advertising expenses and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses  excluding other expenses separately identified in the statement of operations  were million for fiscal versus million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to percent versus percent for fiscal the loss of expense leverage for the year stemmed from the negative same store sales performance  coupled with higher advertising spending  logistics costs and increases in store expenses  primarily caused by the fixed costs related to the year over year increase in the superstore base  as well as normal inflationary increases in operating expenses 
stock based compensation expense includes the expensing of stock options under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation expense and the amortization of the value of restricted stock granted to employees 
stock based compensation expense was million in fiscal  compared with million in the prior year 
the reduced expense is attributable to a reduced expectation  based on our operating performance  regarding the level of performance based shares that may be earned under the restricted stock program resulting in the reversal of performance based expense of million that had been previously recognized 
in addition  stock based compensation was credited for million of expense related to unvested stock awards that had been previously recognized for those executives who left the company during fiscal we are a class action participant in the billion visa mastercard antitrust litigation settlement 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of income to sg a for the estimated portion of the 
table of contents settlement that we expect to receive during the second quarter of fiscal we also recorded a charge to sg a of approximately million related to the departure of a senior executive officer and severance for other personnel whose positions were eliminated during fiscal as part of the repair plan 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal increases driven by recent store growth were offset as our sap enterprise wide system became fully depreciated early in fiscal store pre opening and closing costs 
pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs include lease costs recognized prior to the store opening  hiring and training costs for new employees and processing of initial merchandise 
store closing costs consist of lease termination costs  lease costs for closed locations  loss on disposal of fixtures and equipment  severance for employees  third party inventory liquidation costs and other costs incidental to store closings 
store pre opening and closing costs increased million to million in fiscal  due to the increased level of real estate activity year over year 
store pre opening costs increased million during fiscal to million from million in fiscal store closing costs increased million during fiscal  to million compared with million in the prior year  although the year over year closings decreased from to during fiscal  we opened superstores and four traditional stores  and we closed traditional stores 
goodwill impairment 
the goodwill balance represented the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value assigned to the net assets acquired from house of fabrics  inc in fiscal at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we conducted the annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets for fiscal as a result of the evaluation  we determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and that a full impairment of goodwill existed 
this impairment conclusion was reached considering our market capitalization  declining business trends in our industry  our deteriorating performance  particularly in our seasonally significant fourth quarter  and our assessment of near term future performance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash and non tax deductible charge of million  which represented a write off of the goodwill 
this charge was reported as a separate line item in the statement of operations included in the consolidated financial statements 
operating loss profit 
operating loss was million in fiscal  compared with operating profit of million for fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased million to million from million in fiscal the decrease is attributable to lower average borrowing costs  in part due to the unfavorable impact of an interest rate swap we had in place last year  offset by higher debt levels 
our average debt levels were million this fiscal year versus million last year 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate  before goodwill impairment  for fiscal increased to percent from percent in the prior year 
the increase in the effective tax rate is based primarily on the mix of income from different state jurisdictions  which tax at different rates 
our effective rate is subject to change based on the mix of income from different state jurisdictions  which tax at different rates  as well as the change in status or outcome of uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our effective rate on a quarterly basis and update our estimate of the full year effective rate as necessary 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased percent to billion from billion in the prior year 
same store sales increased percent compared with a same store sales increase of percent for fiscal we operated fewer stores in fiscal versus the prior year 
our total store count at the end of fiscal was down stores  or percent from the prior year  however  the number of superstores in operation at the end of fiscal increased to from in fiscal total store square footage increased slightly from fiscal  to million square feet at the end of fiscal superstores accounted for approximately percent of total net sales during fiscal compared with approximately percent of total net sales for fiscal 
table of contents by store format  our same store sales performance for traditional stores increased percent for fiscal versus a same store sales increase of percent in the prior year 
same store sales for superstores increased percent for fiscal versus a same store sales increase of percent for the prior year 
in both store formats  we saw an increase in average ticket partially offset by a slight decline in customer transactions for the full fiscal year 
our strategy to be less promotional  which has benefited our realized selling margins  had a larger negative impact on superstore sales than traditional store sales because of our dual vehicle advertising strategy direct mail and newspaper inserts in superstores 
by product category  the businesses that performed well during fiscal were our sewing and crafting categories  led by strong performances in the fleece  paper crafting and yarn businesses 
our sewing and crafting businesses  excluding home decorating textiles  represented percent of our total year net sales  and were up approximately percent on a same store sales basis on improved margin rates 
product categories that are tied more closely to home d cor experienced softness during fiscal our home decorating textile category was down approximately percent on a same store sales basis for the year 
our toughest category of the business continued to be finished seasonal 
same store sales of finished seasonal goods decreased approximately percent 
gross margin 
gross margins may not be comparable to those of our competitors and other retailers 
some retailers include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales  while we exclude a portion of them from gross margin  including those costs instead within sg a expenses 
as a percent of net sales  gross margin was percent for fiscal compared with percent in the prior year  an overall increase of basis points 
our strategy to be less promotional was successful in improving our realized selling margins 
this strategy primarily benefited the selling margins in superstores  where we run multiple advertising vehicles 
in addition  we were able to improve gross margins by improving our product sourcing opportunities 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge which was paid in the fourth quarter in connection with a voluntary prior disclosure made to us customs  which lowered our fiscal gross margin rate by basis points 
over a five year period encompassing fiscal years through  we had inadvertently failed to adequately assess anti dumping duty on certain candles imported from china 
the failures resulted from certain products being inaccurately classified at the time of import 
selling  general and administrative expenses

stock based compensation expense includes the expensing of stock options under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation expense and the amortization of the value of restricted stock granted to employees 
stock based compensation expense was million in fiscal  compared with million in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due to the increased level of capital expenditures

our average debt levels were million in fiscal year versus million in the prior year 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal decreased to percent from percent in the prior year 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily based on an anticipated higher realization of certain jobs tax credits 
our effective rate is subject to change based on the mix of income from different state jurisdictions  which tax at different rates  as well as the change in status or outcome of uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our effective rate on a quarterly basis and update our estimate of the full year effective rate as necessary

other costs represent other miscellaneous store closing costs  including among other things  costs related to third party inventory liquidation and fixtures  signage and register removal 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements are primarily for capital expenditures in connection with new store openings  the construction of our third distribution center  other infrastructure investments  and working capital requirements for seasonal inventory builds and new store inventory purchases 
working capital requirements fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the third fiscal quarter as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season during the months of september through december 
these requirements are funded through a combination of internally generated cash flows from operations  credit extended by suppliers and borrowings under our credit facility 
the following table provides cash flow related information for the three fiscal years ended january  net cash used for provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents ending cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents net cash used for provided by operating activities net cash used for operating activities was million in fiscal  compared with net cash provided of million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease was generated by changes in operating assets and liabilities  which in fiscal represented a million use of cash versus a million source of cash in fiscal cash flows from operating activities  before changes in operating assets and liabilities  were million in fiscal versus million generated in fiscal the decrease in cash flows from operating activities  before changes in operating assets and liabilities  was caused primarily by our net loss in fiscal inventories  net of payable support  were a net use of cash of million in fiscal  compared with a million source of cash in fiscal total inventories increased million  or percent year over year 
approximately percent of this increase was in support of our store growth plans  with the remaining percent representing increased inventory levels in same stores and our distribution centers 
inventory levels in our traditional stores were up approximately percent  on a same store basis  and approximately percent in our superstores 
with respect to same store inventory level increases  much of the increase was a result of increased levels of basic goods in support of certain merchandising initiatives and occurred primarily in yarn  paper crafting and fleece 
the growth in those categories softened significantly in the third and fourth quarter  resulting in an excess inventory position 
we are working on selling through this excess inventory as part of our repair plan initiative 
see our earlier discussion under recent developments and business update 
inventory turns for fiscal were approximately times  compared with times in fiscal and times in fiscal the total decrease in operating assets and liabilities in fiscal of million benefited from the receipt of million of landlord lease incentives  which we negotiate as we build out certain new superstore locations 
see the discussion under capital expenditures below 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase was generated by changes in operating assets and liabilities  which in represented a million source of cash versus a million use of cash in cash flows from operating activities  before changes in operating assets and liabilities  were million in fiscal versus million generated in fiscal net cash used for investing activities net cash used for investing activities for fiscal totaled million compared with million used in fiscal and consisted entirely of capital expenditures for both years 
capital expenditures are discussed further below under the caption capital expenditures 
net cash used for investing activities in fiscal totaled million compared with million in fiscal capital expenditures capital expenditures estimated for fiscal and for the last three fiscal years consist of cash expenditures and cash expenditures reimbursed by the landlord 
capital expenditures primarily relate to the operation of the stores  including new store openings  distribution center construction  maintenance capital and information technology 
we also incur capital outlays for distribution center equipment and other non store capital investments 
landlord reimbursed capital expenditures represent the cost of assets acquired with landlord lease incentives 
capital expenditures are summarized as follows outlook cash cash landlord reimbursed total capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million 
store related expenditures  including our superstore openings  accounted for approximately percent of total capital spending in fiscal 
table of contents expenditures related to the construction of our new distribution center in opelika  alabama accounted for approximately percent of total capital spending in fiscal during fiscal  we opened superstores and four traditional stores and closed traditional stores 
we have completed construction of the opelika distribution center 
the total capital cost of this project is estimated to be to million 
the facility opened in april capital spending on this project was million for fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million 
store related expenditures  including our superstore openings  accounted for over percent of total capital spending in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million 
store related expenditures  including new store openings  represented over percent of the capital spending 
during the year  we opened superstores  converted four larger traditional stores to the superstore format and opened three larger traditional stores 
we anticipate capital expenditures in fiscal of approximately to million 
we plan to reduce the number of new store openings from stores in fiscal to stores of which we expect will be superstores in fiscal  and defer other discretionary capital spending 
our capital spending plan  net of landlord lease incentives received  for fiscal is approximately to million 
net cash provided by used for financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared with net cash used for financing activities of million during fiscal long term debt at the end of fiscal was million and consisted of million on our credit facility and million of percent senior subordinated notes the notes 
debt levels increased million during fiscal  compared with a net decrease of million in the prior year  primarily due to increases in inventory and working capital requirements 
in february  we amended our credit facility primarily to increase the commitment from million to million 
the amendment  among other things  also improved advance rates on inventory during peak borrowing periods and modified the consolidated net worth covenant 
see sources of liquidity below for further discussion of the credit facility 
net cash used for financing activities was million during fiscal compared with million during fiscal long term debt at the end of fiscal was million  our lowest year end debt level in seven years 
debt levels decreased million during fiscal  compared with a net decrease of million in the prior year 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we completed two capital financing initiatives 
in february  we issued million of percent notes  which enabled us to repurchase the remaining million of our percent senior subordinated notes that were outstanding at the beginning of the year at an aggregate premium of percent to par value 
in april  we amended our credit facility  extending the term until april  and reducing the commitment to million 
see sources of liquidity below for further discussion of these financing initiatives 
as of january   we had the ability to borrow up to an additional million under our credit facility 
net cash used for financing activities was million during fiscal and primarily related to a million decrease in debt borrowings resulting from cash generated by strong operating performance 
during fiscal  we redeemed or repurchased in the open market  approximately million of our percent senior subordinated notes at an aggregate premium of percent to par value 
these purchases were made utilizing excess cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility 
common share repurchases during fiscal  we purchased  of our common shares at an aggregate price of million  utilizing proceeds received from stock option exercises 
as of january   we are authorized to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock under previous authorizations from our board of directors 

table of contents sources of liquidity we have three principal sources of liquidity cash from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand  and our credit facility 
we believe that our credit facility  coupled with cash on hand and cash from operations  will be sufficient to cover our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirement needs for the foreseeable future 
our liquidity is based  in part  on our debt ratings 
as of the end of fiscal  our long term unsecured debt was rated b by moody s investor services and b by standard poor s 
both moody s and standard poor s had us on a credit watch with a negative outlook 
standard and poor s lowered our unsecured debt rating in january from b to b  and in april  from b to ccc  and removed us from credit watch with a negative outlook 
in february  moody s lowered our unsecured debt rating from b to b  maintaining the credit watch with a negative outlook 
these downgrades are primarily due to the deterioration in our business performance over the past year  as well as the additional debt and lease leverage we have accumulated 
in assessing our credit strength  both moody s and standard poor s consider our capital structure and financial policies  as well as our consolidated balance sheet and other financial information 
downgrades of our credit ratings would adversely impact  among other things  our future borrowing costs  access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs  although we anticipate no short term effect under our current credit arrangements 
our current debt obligations as of the end of fiscal include million in borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  and million outstanding under our percent senior subordinated notes 
senior bank credit facility 
our credit facility is a million revolver led by bank of america retail finance  inc formerly fleet retail group  inc that expires april  this facility s most recent amendments are summarized below in february  we amended the credit facility primarily to increase the commitment from million to million 
the amendment  among other things  also improved advance rates on inventory during peak borrowing periods and modified the consolidated net worth covenant 
in april  we extended the expiration date of the credit facility to april  the credit facility is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in our inventory  accounts receivable  property and other assets and is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is calculated at the bank s base rate or london interbank offered rate libor plus percent to percent  depending on the level of excess availability as defined in the credit agreement that is maintained 
at the end of fiscal  interest on our borrowings under the credit facility was both at the bank s base rate and libor plus percent 
the credit facility contains a sub limit for letters of credit of million 
deferred financing costs of million  related to the unamortized portion of the deferred financing costs of the original financing  as well as the amendment fees  are being amortized over the term of the credit facility 
as of january   we had borrowings outstanding of million under the credit facility at an interest rate of percent and million in letters of credit outstanding 
our weighted average interest rate including the impact of the million interest rate swap that expired on april  and weighted average borrowings under the credit facility and prior senior bank credit facility were percent and million during fiscal and percent and million during fiscal the credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantee obligations  engage in mergers or consolidations  dispose of assets  make investments  acquisitions  loans or advances  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  conduct certain corporate activities  create liens  or change the nature of our business 
we are restricted in our ability to prepay or modify the terms of other indebtedness  pay dividends and make other distributions when excess availability  as defined  falls below certain levels 
further  we are required to comply with a minimum 
table of contents consolidated net worth financial covenant if excess availability  as defined  is less than million at any time 
as of january   excess availability was million  and at our peak borrowing level during fiscal  the excess availability was million 
the credit facility also defines various events of default  including cross default provisions  defaults for any material judgments or a change in control 
during fiscal we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
senior subordinated notes 
on february   we issued million percent notes due interest on the notes is payable on march and september of each year 
deferred debt costs recorded at issuance of million are reflected in other long term assets and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the notes utilizing the effective interest method 
we have the option of redeeming the notes at any time after march  in accordance with certain call provisions of the related notes indenture 
the notes represent unsecured obligations that are subordinated to the credit facility and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
net proceeds from the fiscal placement of approximately million were used to repurchase the balance of the percent senior subordinated notes that remained outstanding and for general corporate purposes 
the notes indenture contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make restricted payments  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  create liens  sell assets  issue guarantees of and pledges securing indebtedness and require an offer to repurchase the notes in the event of a change in control 
the indenture defines various events of default  including cross default provisions and defaults for any material judgments 
at january   we are in compliance with all covenants under the notes indenture 
failure to comply with these restrictions and covenants could result in defaults under our credit facility and or the notes indenture 
any default  if not waived  could result in our debt becoming immediately due and payable 
during fiscal and  we purchased million and million  respectively  in face value of the percent senior subordinated notes 
the purchases were made at an aggregate premium of percent and percent  respectively  to par value 
we recorded pre tax charges of million and million  in fiscal years and  respectively  primarily for the cash premium paid and the related write off of applicable deferred debt costs 
these charges are reflected in the debt repurchase and share reclassification expenses line item in the statement of operations 
restricted stock program during fiscal  we implemented changes in our long term compensation for employees  which we believed would help us to attract and retain the best employees  and better align employee interests with those of our shareholders 
a larger portion of annual grants to employees are now being made in restricted stock awards rather than stock options 
the award of restricted stock offers employees the opportunity to earn shares of our stock over time  rather than options that provide employees the right to purchase stock at a set price 
stock options also continue to be awarded to new employees and employees who are promoted into certain management positions 
in fiscal and  the compensation committee of the board of directors approved an annual base award of restricted stock to certain of our employees that is intended to serve as a retention vehicle and is coupled with performance awards 
the base and performance awards vest percent at the end of three years  with the remaining percent vesting at the end of the fourth year 
the base award grants  which are time based awards  amounted to approximately  restricted shares in fiscal and  restricted shares in fiscal the performance based award provides the potential to receive generally up to three times that amount in additional shares 
the number of performance award shares ultimately received  if any  will depend on achieving certain earnings performance goals over the three year time frame  which we currently do not believe can be achieved 
the expense recognition for the value of restricted shares is based on the vesting period and an estimate regarding certain performance levels over the three year measurement period 
as of january   all stock based compensation expense associated with performance based awards  totaling million  has been reversed due to our operating performance 

table of contents on november   the compensation committee of the board of directors approved a retention program which provided a guaranteed cash retention payment  in lieu of a bonus opportunity under the management incentive plan  and awarded restricted stock and stock options under the plan to key management employees 
the restricted stock awards amounted to approximately  shares and will vest on march  and on march  the stock option awards amounted to approximately  shares and will vest on march  and on march  off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not currently dependent on the use of off balance sheet transactions other than letters of credit and operating leases  which are typical in a retail environment 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from contractual obligations and commitments as of january  payments due by period less than after total year years years years percent senior subordinated notes percent senior subordinated notes interest credit facility revolving facility letters of credit operating leases total contractual cash obligations interest is included as a contractual obligation on the percent notes only 
the calculation of interest on the credit facility is dependent on the average borrowings during the year and a variable interest rate  which currently approximates percent set at basis points over libor 
we did not include these amounts due to their subjectivity and estimation required 
see liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity for further discussion of the credit facility 
includes commercial letters of credit of million and million of standby letters of credit 
seasonality and inflation our business exhibits seasonality  which is typical for most retail companies 
our sales are much stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year 
net earnings are highest during the months of september through december when sales volumes provide significant operating leverage 
working capital requirements needed to finance our operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season during the fourth quarter

there can be no assurance  however  that our operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates management strives to report the company s financial results in a clear and understandable manner 
we follow generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and or conditions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements  but the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are as follows inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain management estimates and judgments 
these include estimates of shrink  as well as estimates of net realizable value on product designated for clearance  which affects the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the gross margins reported for the year 
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our recent store physical inventories 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger 
substantially all of our store physical inventory counts are taken in the first three quarters of each year and the shrink accrual recorded at january  is based on shrink results of prior physical inventories 
all of our store locations that have been open one year or more are physically inventoried once a year 
we will continue to monitor and adjust our shrink rate estimates based on the results of store physical inventories and shrink trends 
we estimate our reserve for clearance product based on the consideration of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  quantities of slow moving or carryover seasonal merchandise on hand  historical recovery statistics and future merchandising plans 
the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends 
vendor allowances all vendor consideration received  including cash discounts  volume discounts and co operative advertising fees are included as a reduction of cost of sales 
cash discounts and volume discounts are 
table of contents recognized in cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold 
we recognize co operative advertising fees under vendor agreements when the related merchandise is sold according to emerging issues task force issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  and the execution of new or modifications of existing vendor agreements 
gift cards and gift card breakage proceeds from the sale of gift cards are recorded as a liability and recognized as net sales when redeemed by the holder 
gift card breakage represents the remaining balance of our liability for gift cards for which the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
this gift card breakage is determined based on the historical redemption patterns of gift cards 
beginning in fiscal  we began to recognize gift card breakage as a component of net sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized million of pre tax income related to the recognition of gift card breakage 
fiscal was the first period in which we recognized gift card breakage under the redemption method which resulted in an adjustment for breakage income related to gift cards sold since fiscal valuation of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future estimated net cash flows to be generated by those assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we conducted the annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of the evaluation  we determined that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and that a full impairment of goodwill existed 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and  we performed the required annual impairment tests of the carrying amount of goodwill and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  except for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
we conduct this review on an ongoing basis and record any required impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal  we performed impairment tests as required by sfas no 
as a result of the evaluation  we recorded impairments of million and million  respectively  on assets of certain stores still in operation 
there was no impairment recorded in fiscal store closing costs we account for store closing costs according to the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accrued expenses we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
our most material estimates relate to compensation  taxes and insurance related expenses  portions of which are self insured 
our workers compensation and general liability insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed as well as historical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
these estimates are based on historical loss development factors 
our employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on our medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
differences in our estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual 
table of contents requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
historically  such differences have not been significant 
operating leases rent expense for our operating leases  which may have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the initial lease term includes the build out period of our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
the difference between rent expense and rent paid is recorded as a deferred rent liability and is included in the consolidated balance sheets 
construction allowances and landlord incentives received from landlords are recorded as a deferred rent liability and amortized to rent expense over the initial term of the lease 
our statement of cash flows reflects the receipt of incentives as an increase in cash flows from operating activities 
income taxes we do business in various jurisdictions that impose income taxes 
management determines the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount currently payable based upon the tax statutes of each jurisdiction  pursuant to the asset and liability method 
this process involves adjusting book income for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
if different judgments had been made  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could have been different 
our current tax provision can be affected by our mix of income and identification or resolution of uncertain tax positions 
because income from different jurisdictions may be taxed at different rates  the shift in mix during a year or over years can cause the effective tax rate to change 
we base our rate during the year on our best estimate of an annual effective rate  and update those estimates quarterly 
we also regularly evaluate the status and likely outcome of uncertain tax positions 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to ensure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements that may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
recent accounting pronouncements in addition to the accounting pronouncements referenced above in our discussion of critical accounting policies  the following accounting pronouncements may have an impact on our results of operations or financial position  as discussed further below

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on merchandise that is sourced internationally and the impact of interest rate changes on our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations do not contain significant market risk due to the nature of our relationships with our international vendors 
all merchandise contracts are denominated in us dollars and are subject to negotiation prior to our commitment for purchases 
as a result  there is not a direct correlation between merchandise prices and fluctuations in the exchange rate 
we sourced approximately one third of our purchases internationally in fiscal our international purchases are concentrated in china and other asian countries 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our objective in managing the exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the volatility and impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
this is accomplished through the debt structure we set in place in early fiscal  which consists of the fixed rate million notes and our variable rate credit facility  which is designed to be a working capital facility 
we estimate that a one percent increase or decrease in interest rates  based on fiscal average debt levels  would cause an increase or decrease to interest expense of million 
in the past  we also utilized interest rate swaps to achieve our objective of managing our exposure to interest rate changes 
we utilized interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our variable rate bank credit facilities 
we had a million interest rate swap with a fixed libor of percent that expired on april  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we reviewed and designated our interest rate swap agreement as a cash flow hedge and recognized the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement on the balance sheet in accrued expenses 
changes in the fair value of this agreement is recorded in other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
during fiscal and fiscal  unrealized after tax net gains of million and million  respectively  were recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the hedge ineffectiveness expense income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively  and is reflected in interest expense
