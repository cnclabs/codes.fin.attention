item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
overview and strategy our primary objective is to increase stockholder value by increasing reserves  production  cash flow and earnings 
we have shifted the balance of our investments from properties having high rates of production in early years to properties expected to produce more consistently over a longer term 
we attempt to reduce our financial risks by dedicating a smaller portion of our capital to high risk projects  while reserving the majority of our available capital for acquisitions  exploitation and development drilling opportunities 
obtaining positions in long lived oil and natural gas reserves are given priority over properties that might provide more cash flow in the early years of production  but which have shorter reserve lives 
we also attempt to further reduce risk by emphasizing acquisition possibilities over high risk exploration projects 
during the latter part of  we reduced our emphasis on high risk exploration efforts and started focusing on established geologic trends where we can utilize the engineering  operational  financial and technical expertise of our entire staff 
although we do participate in some exploratory drilling activities  reducing financial  reservoir  drilling and geological risks and diversifying our property portfolio are important criteria in the execution of our business plan 
in summary  our current business plan focuses on projects having less geological risk  emphasizes acquisition  exploitation  development and enhancement activities  includes the utilization of horizontal and fracture stimulation technologies on certain types of reservoirs  focuses on acquiring producing properties  and expands the scope of operations by diversifying our exploratory and development efforts  both in and outside of our current areas of operation 
although the direction of our exploration and development activities has shifted from high risk exploratory activities to lower risk development opportunities  we will continue our efforts  as we have in the past  to maintain low general and administrative expenses relative to the size of our overall operations  utilize advanced technologies  serve as operator in appropriate circumstances  and reduce operating costs 
the extent to which we are able to implement and follow through with our business plan will be influenced by the prices we receive for the oil and natural gas we produce  the results of reprocessing and reinterpreting our d seismic data  the results of our drilling activities  the costs of obtaining high quality field services  our ability to find and consummate acquisition opportunities  and our ability to negotiate and enter into work to earn arrangements  joint venture or other similar agreements on terms acceptable to us 

table of contents significant changes in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas  or the occurrence of unanticipated events beyond our control may cause us to defer or deviate from our business plan  including the amounts we have budgeted for our activities 
operating performance our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas and our productions volumes 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
natural gas prices we receive are influenced by seasonal demand  weather  hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  availability of pipeline transportation to end users  proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and world oil prices 
additional factors influencing our overall operating performance include production expenses  overhead requirements  and costs of capital 
our oil and natural gas exploration  development and acquisition activities require substantial and continuing capital expenditures 
historically  the sources of financing to fund our capital expenditures have included cash flow from operations  sales of our equity securities  bank borrowings  and industry joint ventures 
depletion per boe in was versus in and in the increase per boe in was a result of increased drilling costs and acquisitions of producing properties 
our oil and natural gas producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting method  we capitalize all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties and the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these costs include lease acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  costs of drilling productive and non productive wells  and overhead expenses directly related to land and property acquisition and exploration and development activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized unless a disposition involves a material change in reserves  in which case the gain or loss is recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  including estimated future development costs  is provided using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves and production  which are converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are not amortized  but are individually assessed for impairment 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and natural gas properties being depleted 

table of contents results of operations as described under item business about our strategy and business  we changed our business model in at the beginning of  our reserves were approximately mmboe with a reserves to production ratio of approximately to through the execution of this business model  our reserves at the end of were approximately mmboe with a reserves to production ratio of approximately to as described on page of this report  the failure to replace oil and gas reserves may negatively affect our business 
we monitor this risk by comparing the quantity of our oil and natural gas reserves at the end of each year to our production for that year 
this comparison  which is made in the form of a reserves to production ratio  helps us measure our ability to offset produced volumes with new reserves that will be produced in the future 
the reserves to production ratio is calculated by dividing the total proved reserves at the end of a year by the actual production for the same year 
the ratio provides us with an indication of our performance in replenishing annual production volumes 
the reserves to production ratio is a statistical indicator that has limitations 
the ratio is limited because it can vary widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and property acquisition 
in addition  the ratio does not take into account the cost or timing of future production of new reserves 
for that reason  the ratio does not  and is not intended to  provide a measurement of value 
at the end of  our production was natural gas and oil  as compared to natural gas and oil at the end of the production stream changed from short life gulf coast natural gas to long life permian basin oil production and has increased our lease operating expense primarily due to increased utilities and chemicals associated with the oil properties

table of contents critical accounting policies and practices full cost and impairment of assets 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
costs of non producing properties  wells in process of being drilled and significant development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations  is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling  based on the present value of estimated future net revenues  net of income tax effects  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of our unproved properties 
revenues are measured at unescalated oil and natural gas prices at the end of each quarter  with effect given to our cash flow hedge positions 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down to the extent of the excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
there is a risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices decline 
if commodity prices deteriorate  it is possible that we could incur an impairment in future periods 
depletion 
provision for depletion of oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method is calculated using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves with oil and natural gas production being converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
oil and natural gas properties included million and million for and  respectively  for unproved properties not included in depletion 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and natural gas properties being depleted 
proved reserve estimates 
our discounted present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation  and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
our reserve estimates are prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a full cost ceiling write down 
at december   the excess of the ceiling over our capitalized costs was over million 
in addition to the impact of these estimates of proved reserves on calculation of the ceiling  estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely 
accordingly  the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and  on any particular day at the end of a quarter  can be either substantially higher or lower than prices we actually receive in the long term  which are a barometer for true fair value 
use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  expenses  and some narrative disclosures 
hydrocarbon reserves  future development costs and certain hydrocarbon production expenses are the most critical estimates to our consolidated financial statements 
derivatives 
the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 that requires all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  for the period from january  to june   derivative contracts were designated as cash flow hedges 
these contracts have remained designated as cash flow hedges through december  accordingly  the effective por 
table of contents tion of the unrealized gains or losses has been recorded in other comprehensive loss until the settlement of the contract position occurs 
at settlement of these contracts  the cash value paid is recorded in revenue along with the oil and gas sales or in interest expense along with our interest expense that we incurred with our credit facility agreements 
for periods prior to and for periods after july   derivative contracts entered into were not designated as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  the unrealized gain or loss on these derivative contracts was recorded in other income 
at settlement of these contracts  the settlement value will remain in other income and will not be offset against the oil and gas sales revenue or in interest expense 
although we have designated our derivative contracts differently in different periods  the purpose of all of our derivative contracts is to provide a measure of stability in our oil and natural gas receipts and interest rate payments and to manage exposure to commodity price and interest rate risk under existing sales contracts 
years ended december  and december  our oil and natural gas revenues and production product mix are displayed in the following table for the years ended december  and oil and gas revenues revenues production restated oil bbls natural gas mcf total includes the effects of derivative transactions accounted for as hedges

table of contents drilling program in the diamond m canyon reef 
the increase in oil production increased revenue approximately million for wellhead average realized crude oil prices increased per bbl or to per bbl for compared to the increase in oil price increased revenue approximately million for natural gas revenues  excluding hedges  increased million or for the year ended compared to natural gas production volumes increased due to production from drilling discoveries in our south texas wilcox wells and initial production from our fort worth basin barnett shale wells 
the increase in natural gas volumes increased revenue approximately million for average realized wellhead natural gas prices increased or per mcf to per mcf 
the increase in natural gas prices had a positive effect on revenues of approximately million for the period ending the negative effect on oil revenues of oil hedges increased million or for compared to due to the increase in oil prices 
the negative effect on natural gas revenues of natural gas hedge losses was  in  as compared to  in although natural gas prices increased in  we had less natural gas volumes hedged for on a boe basis  hedges accounted for a reduction in revenue of per boe in compared to per boe in costs and expenses year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease dollars in thousands lease operating expense production taxes general and administrative general and administrative public reporting total general and administrative depreciation and depletion total lease operating expense increased or million compared to of our production is long life oil assets which are in the west texas fullerton  carm ann  newly acquired harris properties and work to earn agreement at diamond m 
our increase in lease operating expenses is due to mechanical  ad valorem and utility costs thereby our related lifting costs were per boe in compared to per boe in we experienced a increase in our per boe lifting costs primarily due to higher lifting costs associated with operating new wells and newly acquired wells for the year ended december   as we continue to exploit and develop our long life permian basin oil properties fullerton  carm ann  harris and diamond m  and if our production increases as we expect  we also expect that our lifting costs will continue around the same level or decline due to efficiencies gained by increased activity 
the lifting costs are also expected to be reduced by the development of natural gas properties in south texas  barnett shale and permian basin of new mexico 
production taxes increased or million in  associated with a net wellhead increase in revenues of million 
production taxes in future periods will continue to be a function of product mix  production volumes and product prices 
general and administrative expenses in total increased or million in compared to general and administrative expenses increased with our aggressive drilling program in through employee additions  bonus payments  benefits  and public reporting costs 
general and administrative expenses capitalized to the full cost pool were million for compared to million for on a boe basis  general and administrative costs were per boe in compared to per boe in  while public reporting costs were per boe and per boe for the same period 
general and administrative expenses will increase in in association with reporting requirements and operational support of current and new acquisitions 
depreciation and depletion expense increased or million for compared to depletion per boe was for and for this increase is attributable to property purchases and increased drilling costs 
depreciation expense increased with the cost of a new accounting and production system in depletion costs are highly correlated with production volumes and capital expenditures 
fiscal year depletion costs will increase with increased production volumes

as a result  changes in the fair value of these contracts were recorded in this account 
the loss also increased because of large increases in commodity prices for oil contracts 
future gains or losses on changes in derivatives will be impacted by the volatility of commodity prices and interest rates  as well as the terms of any new derivative contracts 
the loss associated with the ineffective portion of our hedges decreased  or for compared to commodity prices increased in  resulting in an ineffective portion to be recorded in other expense 
the ineffective hedge gain or loss may increase or decrease until settlement of our contracts 
as of december   we have only one remaining commodity contract and one remaining interest rate swap contract designated as cash flow hedges as defined by sfas interest expense increased with the increase of debt from million to million in along with an increase of our average loan interest rate from to later in other expenses decreased in associated with legal  accounting and related costs associated with an aborted high yield debt offering in interest expense will increase for with increased borrowings due to our acquisitions  potential interest rate increases and our increased drilling budget

basic weighted average common shares outstanding increased from million shares in to million shares in diluted weighted average common shares increased from million shares in to million shares in the increase in common shares is due to the private placement of million shares in late december and stock options exercised in capital resources and liquidity our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties  bank borrowings supported by our oil and natural gas reserve sales of non strategic properties and equity offerings 
our level of earnings and cash flows depends on many factors  including the prices we receive for oil and natural gas we produce 
working capital decreased or  as of december  compared with december  current assets exceeded current liabilities by  at december  the major working capital decrease was associated with increased derivative obligations as a result of the increase in oil and natural gas prices 
the following table summarizes our cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities year ended december  in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents cash provided from operating activities in increased million over largely due to increased operating income from our increased capital projects the carm ann acquisition  new production in the wilcox gas project and increased sales prices in cash used in investing activities increased in compared to primarily as a result of the harris acquisition and our increased drilling for cash provided by financing activities increased in relationship due to borrowings to fund our acquisition and increased drilling offset by our equity offering in february proceeds from the equity offering were utilized in reducing our debt 
we had additions to oil and gas properties of million for the year ended december   which were primarily due to our property acquisitions of million  leasehold acquisition  development  and enhancement activities 
also added to our property basis were asset retirement costs of  see note 
the property acquisitions  development and enhancement activities were financed by the utilization of cash flows provided by operations and our credit facility 
as of march  the amount available under our universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities of exchange commission for the offer and sale  from time to time  of our debt and equity securities totaled approximately million 
based on our projected oil and natural gas revenues and related expenses and available bank borrowings  we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources to fund normal operations and capital requirements  interest expense and principal reduction payments on bank debt  if required 
we continually review and consider alternative methods of funding 
credit facilities we have two separate credit facilities 
our third amended and restated credit agreement or the revolving credit agreement  dated as of december   with a group of bank lenders provides a revolving line of credit having a borrowing base limitation of million at december  the total amount that we can borrow and have outstanding at any one time is limited to the lesser of million or the borrowing base established by the lenders 
at december   the principal amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility was million  excluding  reserved for our letters of credit 
the second credit facility is a five year term loan facility provided to us under a second lien term loan agreement the second lien agreement  dated as of november   with a group of banks and other lenders 
at december   our term loan under this facility was fully funded in the principal amount of million  which was outstanding on that same date 
revolving credit facility the revolving credit agreement provides for a credit facility that allows us to borrow  repay and reborrow amounts available under the revolving credit facility 
the amount of the borrowing base is based primarily upon the estimated value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
the borrowing base amount is redetermined by the lenders semi annually on or about april and october of each year or at other times required by the lenders or at our request 
if  as a result of the lenders redetermination of the borrowing base  the outstanding principal amount of our loans exceeds the borrowing base  we must either provide additional collateral to the lenders or repay the outstanding principal of our loans in an amount equal to the excess 
except for the principal payments that may be required because of our outstanding loans being in excess of the borrowing base  interest only is payable monthly 
loans made to us under this revolving credit facility bear interest at the base rate of citibank  na or the libor rate  at our election 
generally  citibank s base rate is equal to its prime rate as announced from time to time by citibank 
the libor rate is generally equal to the sum of a the rate designated as british bankers association interest settlement rates and offered on one  two  three  six or twelve month interest periods for deposits of million  and b a margin ranging from to  depending upon the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than  but less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
the interest rate we are required to pay on our borrowings  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 
at december   our libor interest rate  plus margin  was on million 
in the case of base rate loans  interest is payable on the last day of each month 
in the case of libor loans  interest is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 

table of contents if the total outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility are less than the borrowing base  an unused commitment fee is required to be paid to the lenders 
the amount of the fee is 
of the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the borrowing base 
the fee is payable quarterly 
if the borrowing base is increased  we are required to pay a fee of 
on the amount of any increase in the borrowing base 
all outstanding principal under the revolving credit facility is due and payable on october  the maturity date of our outstanding loans may be accelerated by the lenders upon the occurrence of an event of default under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit facility contains various restrictive financial covenants and compliance requirements 
as a result of financial statement errors concerning our accounting for certain oil and natural gas and interest rate derivative instruments  we were not in compliance with certain covenants concerning financial reporting 
we have obtained waivers of these covenants from our lenders 
we were in compliance with the remainder of the covenants in our revolving credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the revolving credit facility also contains restrictions on all retained earnings and net income for payment of dividends on common stock 
second lien term loan facility the second lien agreement provides a million term loan 
loans made to us under this credit facility bear interest at an alternate base rate or the libor rate  at our election 
the alternate base rate is the greater of a the prime rate in effect on such day and b the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of  plus a margin of per annum 
the libor rate is generally equal to the sum of a a the rate designated as british bankers association interest settlement rates and offered on one  two  three or six month interest periods for deposits of million and b an applicable margin rate per annum equal to 
at december   our libor interest rate  plus the applicable margin  was on million 
in the case of alternate base rate loans  interest is payable the last day of each march  june  september and december 
in the case of libor loans  interest is payable the last day of the tranche period not to exceed a three month period 
all outstanding principal under the second lien agreement is due and payable on november  the maturity date may be accelerated by the lenders upon the occurrence of an event of default under the second lien agreement 
prepayments in whole or in part if made prior to the first anniversary date will bear a premium of of the amount prepaid 
there is no premium after the first anniversary date 
the second lien agreement contains various restrictive financial covenants and compliance requirements 
as a result of financial statement errors concerning our accounting for certain oil and natural gas and interest rate derivative instruments  we were not in compliance with certain covenants concerning financial reporting 
we have obtained waivers of these covenants from our lenders

commodity price risk management transactions and effects of derivative instruments the purpose of all of our derivative trades is to provide a measure of stability in cash flow as a result of our daily activities associated with the selling of oil and gas production and expenditures associated with borrowings that we have secured through our credit facilities 
the derivative trade arrangements we have employed include collars  costless collars  floors or purchased puts  oil and natural gas and interest rate swaps 
in  we designated our derivative trades as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas  as amended 
although our purpose for entering into derivative trades has remained the same  contracts entered into after june  were not designated as cash flow hedges 
under cash flow hedge accounting for oil and natural gas production  the quarterly effective portion of the change in fair value of the commodity derivatives is recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss and then transferred to revenue in the period the related oil and gas production is sold 
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges changes in the fair value of derivative instruments due to changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price are recognized in other expenses as they occur 
while the cash flow hedge contract is open  the ineffective gain or loss may increase or decrease until settlement of the contract 
as of december   we had bbls per day of our anticipated production through december  designated as cash flow hedges 
all other commodity derivative trades are accounted for by mark to market accounting whereby changes in fair value are charged to earnings 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as these changes occur in the other income expense  net section of this statement 
to the extent these trades relate to production in and beyond and oil prices increase  we report a loss currently  but if there is no further change in prices  our revenue will be correspondingly higher than if there had been no price increase when the production is sold 
under cash flow hedge accounting for interest rates  the quarterly change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss 
the gain or loss is transferred  on a contract by contract basis  to interest expense as the interest accrues 
ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in other expense as they occur 
as of december   floating rate interest on only million of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement was hedged for all other interest rate swaps that we have entered into for and beyond are accounted for by mark to market accounting as prescribed in sfas we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties in our derivative trade instruments 
however  we periodically assess the creditworthiness of the counterparties to mitigate this credit risk 
for additional information about our price risk management transactions  see item a of this annual report on form k  beginning on page future capital requirements our capital expenditure budget for is approximately million and is highly dependent on future oil and natural gas prices and the availability of funding 
these expenditures will be governed by the following factors internally generated cash flows  availability of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  availability supply and services  additional sources of funding  and future drilling successes 

table of contents in  we anticipate spending million  or of our capital investment budget on two horizontal drilling gas projects  the new mexico wolfcamp and the barnett shale projects 
we also plan to spend million  or of the budget  on long life  shallow oil properties located in the permian basin of west texas 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have contractual obligations and commitments that may affect our financial position 
the following table is a summary of significant contractual obligations obligation due in period contractual cash obligations after years total in thousands revolving credit facility secured second lien term loan agreement office lease dinero plaza andrews and snyder field offices asset retirement obligations derivative obligations total the snyder field office lease remains in effect until the termination of our trade agreement with a third party working interest owner in the diamond m project 
the andrews field office lease expires in december the lease cost for these two office facilities are billed to nonaffiliated third party working interest owners under our joint operating agreements with these third parties 
asset retirement obligations of oil and natural gas assets  excluding salvage value and accretion 
deferred taxes are not included in the table above 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards combined with our plans for development and acquisitions may offset any major cash outflows 
however  the ultimate timing of the settlements cannot be precisely determined 
in addition to our principal payment obligations under the revolving credit facility and second lien term loan facility noted in the table above  we are subject to interest payments on such indebtedness 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated special purpose entities 
outlook the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make  and anticipate that we will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures in the exploration for  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  our capital expenditures have been financed primarily with internally generated cash from operations  proceeds from bank borrowings  and proceeds from sales of equity securities 
the continued availability of these capital sources depends upon a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the volumes of oil and natural gas we produce from existing wells  the prices at which we sell oil and natural gas  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 

table of contents each of these variables materially affects our borrowing capacity 
we may from time to time seek additional financing in the form of increased bank borrowings  sales of parallel s securities  sales of non core properties  or other forms of financing 
we do not have agreements for any future financing and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing 
inflation our drilling costs have escalated and we would expect this trend to continue  but our commodity prices have also increased at the same time 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas  as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb opinion no 
 as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
in  the company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees described in sfas using the prospective transition method 
in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb  issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r will provide investors and other users of financial statements with more complete and neutral financial information by requiring that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements  including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r replaces fasb sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
public entities other than those filing as small business issuers were required to apply sfas r as of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a rule that amended the required application date of sfas r from interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june   to the beginning of the entity s next fiscal year 
we plan to use the modified prospective transition method under which we will record as compensation expense over the requisite service period the fair value of all new options and previously granted options for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of january  we estimate that the adoption of sfas r  will result in compensation expense  related to options outstanding as of december   of approximately      and  for     and  respectively  based on our estimates of the fair value of those options 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb sfas no 
 which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and also to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not contain specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
carries forward without change the guidance contained in apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
effective january  and the adoption may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations if we have an accounting change 

table of contents item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about market risks and derivative instruments to which parallel was a party at december   and from which parallel may incur future earnings  gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and oil and natural gas prices 
interest rate sensitivity as of december  our only financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates are our bank debt and interest rate swaps 
as the interest rate is variable and reflects current market conditions  the carrying value of our bank debt approximates the fair value 
the table below shows principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates were determined using weighted average interest paid and accrued in december  you should read note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt that is sensitive to interest rates 
total dollars in thousands variable rate debt revolving credit facility secured average interest rate term loan second lien average interest rate at december   we had bank loans in the amount of approximately million outstanding at an average interest rate of 
under our revolving credit facility  we may elect an interest rate based upon the agent bank s base lending rate or the libor rate  plus a margin ranging from to per annum  depending on our borrowing base usage 
the interest rate we are required to pay  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 
under our second lien term loan facility  we may elect an interest rate based upon an alternate base rate  or the libor rate  plus a margin of 
as of december   we had employed a fixed interest rate swap contract with bnp paribas  based on the day libor rates at the time of the contract 
this interest rate swap is treated as a cash flow hedge as defined by sfas this interest rate swap is on million of our variable rate debt for all of we will continue to pay the variable interest rates for this portion of our borrowing on the revolving credit facility  but due to the interest rate swap  we have fixed the rate at 
under the terms of this contract  in periods during which the fixed interest rate stated in the agreement exceeds the variable rate which is based on the day libor rate  we pay to the counterparties an amount determined by applying this excess fixed rate to the notional amount of the contract 
in periods when the variable rate exceeds the fixed rate stated in the swap contract  the counterparties pay an amount to us determined by applying the excess of the variable rate over the stated fixed rate 
as of december   the fair market value of this interest rate swap was as of december   we had also employed additional fixed interest rate swap contracts with bnp and citibank  na based on the day libor rates at the time of the contracts 
however  these contracts are accounted for by mark to market accounting as prescribed in sfas these contracts will not be offset against the future interest we will pay on our bank borrowings identified above 
nonetheless  we view these contracts as additional protection against future interest 
table of contents rate volatility 
below is a table describing the nature of these interest rate swaps and the fair market value of these contracts as of december  estimated notional weighted average fair market value period of time at december  amounts fixed interest rates in millions in thousands january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru october  total fair market value designated as a cash flow hedge 
commodity price sensitivity as of december  our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to the region in which we produce natural gas 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
we expect pricing volatility to continue 
oil prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during natural gas prices we received during ranged from a low of per mcf to a high of per mcf 
a significant decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we employ various derivative instruments in order to minimize our exposure to the commodity price volatility discussed above 
as of december   we had employed put options  costless collars  collars and swaps in order to protect against this price volatility 
although all of the contracts that we have entered into are viewed as protection against this price volatility  all but one of these contracts are accounted for by the mark to market accounting method as prescribed in sfas as of december   we had one commodity swap contract with bnp that was designated as a cash flow hedge 
this contract is for a total of  barrels of crude oil production in at a nymex swap price of per bbl 
this contract expires december  below is a description of our active commodity contracts as of december  put options 
we purchased put options or floors on volumes of  mmbtu per day for a total of  mmbtu during the seven month period from april  through october  at an average floor price of per mmbtu for a total consideration of approximately  the puts have fair market value of  as of december  collars 
collars are contracts which combine both a put option or floor and a call option or ceiling 
these contracts may not involve payment or receipt of cash at inception  depending upon ceiling and floor strike prices 

table of contents a summary of our collar positions at december  is as follows houston nymex ship channel waha barrels oil prices mmbtu of gas prices gas prices fair market period of time of oil floor cap natural gas floor cap floor cap value in thousands january  thru december  april  thru october  april  thru october  january  thru december  april  thru october  january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru december  total fair market value commodity swaps 
generally  swaps are an agreement to buy or sell a specified commodity for delivery in the future  but at an agreed fixed price 
swap transactions convert a floating or market price into a fixed price 
for any particular swap transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the reference price for any settlement period is less than the swap or fixed price for such derivative contract  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the reference price for any settlement period is greater than the swap or fixed price for such derivative contract 
we have entered into oil and gas swap contracts with bnp paribas 
a recap for the period of time  number of bbls  and weighted average swap prices are as follows barrels of nymex oil fair market period of time oil swap price value in thousands january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru december  january  thru december  total fair market value designated as a cash flow hedge 
we have recognized a cumulative total of  in ineffectiveness on our one remaining commodity swap that we have designated as a cash flow hedge
