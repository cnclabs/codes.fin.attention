table of contents overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets products that perform diagnostic testing at sites outside of traditional hospital and clinical laboratories to assist in the assessment of the risk of heart disease  diabetes and certain liver diseases and in the monitoring of therapy to treat those diseases 
our products are sold worldwide 
our primary market is the physician laboratory market  which consists of approximately  sites that are registered with the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  approximately  of which are registered to perform only tests that have been waived under clia 
our corporate headquarters is located in hayward  california 
all of our manufacturing  research  regulatory and administrative activities are conducted at this location 
we sell our products through a worldwide network of over distributors 
we have regional sales managers who coordinate and work with our distribution partners to identify and promote sales of our products 
we also employ field technical service representatives who are responsible for field customer service and customer retention initiatives within our existing installed base of products 
recent events we have experienced recent significant developments and are monitoring certain events that may have an impact on our company  including the following in june  we announced that we had been granted a patent by the us patent office  and the european patent office ep  for a new method of measuring hdl in human blood 
we believe that this patent provides a very different approach than those of other existing patents describing the measurement of hdl and that this patent also permits the development of the cholestech ldx lipid alt cassette by preventing the interference of the hdl chemistry with the alt assay on the same cassette 
in june  we announced that the cholestech ldx system had been certified by the cholesterol reference method laboratory network 
this certification validates that the system consistently meets the gold standard for accuracy and reproducibility developed by the centers for disease control and prevention for the measurement of total cholesterol and hdl cholesterol consistent with ncep analytical goals 
in september  we announced the shipment of the first orders for the cholestech ldx hs crp diagnostic test 
c reactive protein crp is a systemic marker of inflammation 
the hs crp test is used to detect low level increases in crp in apparently healthy individuals 
these increases are due to more subtle forms of inflammation  such as inflammation in the blood vessels  and cannot be detected using conventional crp assays 
this important diagnostic test expands the utility of the ldx and enables us to continue our strategy of leveraging our ldx installed base with additional new tests 
in october  we announced that we are partnering with astrazeneca  a leading pharmaceutical company 
we are providing a high sensitivity c reactive protein hs crp test for the cholestech ldx system to rapidly pre screen patients for eligibility to participate in a global multi site clinical study  sponsored by astrazeneca 
the astrazeneca clinical trial is designed to investigate the effect of a statin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with normal to low cholesterol levels but elevated hs crp 
crp is a systemic marker of inflammation 
the hs crp test is used to detect low level increases of crp in apparently healthy individuals 
these increases are due to more subtle forms of inflammation  such as inflammation in the blood vessels  and cannot be detected using conventional crp assays 
although we earned incremental revenue during the year in connection with this arrangement  the timing and level of market acceptance of the hs crp test are still uncertain 
in november  we announced that we signed a definitive agreement with boule 
under the terms of the agreement  we will collaborate with boule on the development and commercialization of a point of care cbc system  designed for waiver clia 
we will receive exclusive distribution rights covering all human applications in the united states and canada 
for these and other rights  we paid million upon signing  and will pay  upon receipt of fda k clearance and million upon receipt of waiver under clia 
we currently anticipate commercializing the cbc system in late calendar or early currently  there are no clia waived cbc systems in use in the united states and it is expected that this

the improvement in gross margin related to higher average selling prices and the continued shift in product mix toward single use cassettes  which are our highest margin products 
in addition  continued efficiencies in the manufacturing process have contributed to the margin increase 
during fiscal year  we anticipate factory spending will continue to increase at a rate lower than the increase in unit production as we improve manufacturing efficiency through increased production and cost control 
we have licensed certain technology used in some of our products 
one royalty agreement  which expired in march  required us to pay a royalty of on net sales of single use test cassettes

in addition  we have available a million revolving bank line of credit agreement which was renewed in september and will expire in september while the agreement is in effect  we are required to deposit assets with a collective value  as defined in the line of credit agreement  equivalent to no less than of the outstanding principal balance 
amounts outstanding under the line of credit bear interest at either our choice of below the bank s prime rate or above the libor rate  depending on the payment schedule 
we did not borrow under this line of credit during fiscal year as a result  there were no limitations on our deposited assets 
cash provided by operating activities 
the net cash provided by operations increased million to million for fiscal year net cash provided by operations was primarily attributable to net income of million and million of non cash adjustments  including depreciation and deferred taxes

cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal years and  relate to the issuance of common stock pursuant to the employee stock incentive and employee stock purchase plans 
during fiscal years and we raised million and million  respectively  from the two programs 
the amount raised in the future will depend on the market value of our common stock  the prices of the incentive options and the purchase price relating to the employee stock purchase plan 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is in thousands payments due by period more than less than year years years years total operating lease obligations purchase obligations total this represents the minimum payments due under lease obligations 
we expect that cash generated from our projected revenue  existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will enable us to maintain our current and planned core operations for at least the next months 
excluding the roche settlement in fiscal year  we have achieved positive net cash provided by operations for fiscal years through  and we expect to continue to generate cash from operations for the foreseeable future 
in our efforts to grow  we are looking to acquire technologies which could complement our current product offering 
however  should we acquire such technologies we may need to use a significant amount of cash which could cause us to need to raise funds from debt or equity offerings 
in the event that we would need additional financing for the operation of our business  we can draw upon our existing million line of credit which would require us to maintain cash and investments as collateral 
however  we may be required to finance any additional requirements through additional equity  debt financing or credit facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financings or credit facilities  or if these funds are available  they may not be available on satisfactory terms

 june  in thousands  except share data unaudited revenue gross profit net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is pervasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred to our customers  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
provisions for discounts to customers  returns or other adjustments are recorded as a reduction of revenue and provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon analyses of historical discounts and returns 
we recognize revenue associated with service contracts upon completion of the services to be performed under contract when all obligations are satisfied  and collection is reasonably assured 
if all conditions to recognize revenue are not met  we are required to defer revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based primarily on analysis of historical trends and experience 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating results 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of march  and march   respectively 
inventory valuation we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of historical sales  forecasted sales  product expiration and current inventory levels 
if the market value of our products decline  the demand for our products decline  or if a significant amount of material were to become unusable our operating results could be adversely affected 
the inventory reserve was  and  as of march  and march   respectively 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we continually review our deferred tax asset to determine if a valuation allowance is required  primarily based on its estimates of future taxable income 
changes in our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance could give rise to a valuation allowance and an expense in the period of the change 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and comply with the disclosure provision of statement on financial accounting standards  sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the pro forma disclosure of the difference between compensation expense included in net income and the related cost measured by the fair value method is presented in note to the financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
if we were to include the cost of stock based employee compensation in the financial statements  our operating results would decline based on the fair value of the stock based employee compensation 
the fair market value used to determine the amount of compensation is based on several estimates including expected stock volatility  expected life of grant and expected employee turnover 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which is the result of its efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our statements of income 
in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab no 
relating to the adoption of sfas r 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  we will adopt sfas r under the modified prospective transition method using the black scholes pricing model 
under the new standard  our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we will begin recording the fair value of our share based compensation in our financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment revised 
although the adoption of sfas r will have no adverse impact to our balance sheet and cash flows  it will adversely affect our net profit loss and earnings loss per share 
in october  the fasb issued financial statement of position fsp fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fas r fsp r 
fsp r provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined in sfas no 
r 
in accordance with this standard a grant date of an award exists if a the award is unilateral grant and b the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval 
we will adopt this standard when we adopt fas r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
fsp r provides an elective alternative method 
table of contents that establishes a computational component to arrive at the beginning balance of the accumulated paid in capital pool related to employee compensation and simplified method to determine the subsequent impact the accumulated paid in capital pool employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are currently evaluating this transition method 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 

sfas no 
is a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
sfas no 
also addresses the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas no is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp and  which clarifies when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of the other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp and are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december  at march   we have no unrealized investment losses that had not been recognized as other than temporary impairments in our available for sale securities 
we do not anticipate that the implementation of these statements will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures our exposure to market risks is inherent in our operations  primarily to interest rates relating to our investment portfolio 
we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by managing maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
generally we hold our marketable securities until maturity 
these securities have maturity dates that do not exceed fiscal year and have predominately fixed interest rates 
we have concluded that the income on our investments would not be significantly impacted by short term changes in interest rates 
when the securities mature and the principal is reinvested  the yield will reflect the market conditions at that time 
fluctuations in short term interest rates may change the fair market value of our investments  however  as the marketable securities approach maturity  the fair value will approximate our cost basis 
in fiscal year we used forward exchange contracts to manage a portion of the foreign currency exposures arising from inventory purchases and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies 
there was no gain or loss recorded in the period from hedge ineffectiveness or from forecasted transactions no longer expected to occur 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
as of march   we had no outstanding forward contracts 

table of contents the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amount and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term marketable securities 
fiscal year total fair value in thousands cash  cash equivalents short term marketable securities weighted average interest rate long term marketable securities weighted average interest rate qualitative disclosures our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to available for sale securities will fall in value if market interest rates increase  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 
we have the ability to hold a significant portion of the fixed income investments until maturity and therefore would not expect the operating results or cash flows to be affected to a significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and long term marketable securities portfolio
