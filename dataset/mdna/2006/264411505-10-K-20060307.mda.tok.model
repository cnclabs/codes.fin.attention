item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust that began operations through a related entity in as of december   we owned or jointly controlled industrial  office and retail properties including properties under development  consisting of over million square feet primarily located in operating platforms  and owned or jointly controlled approximately  acres of land with an estimated future development potential of approximately million square feet of industrial  office and retail properties 
we provide the following services for our properties and for certain properties owned by third parties and joint ventures property leasing  property management  construction  development  and other tenant related services 
management philosophy and priorities our key business and financial strategies for the future include the following our business objective is to increase funds from operations ffo by i maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties  ii developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets  iii expanding geographically by acquiring and developing properties in new markets  iv using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis  v developing properties in our existing markets and other markets which we will sell through our merchant building development program and vi providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties 
see the year in review section below for further explanation and definition of ffo 
our financing strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure including common and preferred equity and debt to maintain a conservatively leveraged balance sheet and investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies 
this strategy provides us with the financial flexibility to fund both development and acquisition opportunities 
we seek to maintain a well balanced  conservative and flexible capital structure by i extending and sequencing the maturity dates of debt  ii borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than  iii pursuing current and future long term debt financings and refinancing on an unsecured basis  iv maintaining conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios  and v issuing attractively priced perpetual preferred stock for of our total capital structure 
year in review during  we emerged from economic and market challenges that had affected the entire real estate industry to complete a successful year that included improving our portfolio of held for investment buildings through our capital recycling program  increasing our development pipeline to over double that of  and initiating geographic expansion that we anticipate will provide future earnings growth 
as a result of these accomplishments  we achieved steady operating results while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
net income available for common shareholders for the year ended december   was million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted for the year ended the increase is primarily attributable to the sale of a portfolio of real estate properties  consisting of million square feet of primarily light distribution and service center properties the industrial portfolio sale 
the net book gain on this sale was approximately million 
see additional discussion of the transaction below 
through increased leasing activity  we achieved a growth in rental revenues in over as our in service portfolio year end occupancy increased from at the end of to at the end of we also experienced an increase in our development and construction of new properties for both owned investments and third party construction projects in as compared to as an important performance metric for us as a real estate company  ffo available to common shareholders totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in we anticipated a short term decrease in ffo as a result of the industrial portfolio sale noted above 
ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust reit 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and makes comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo assists in comparing the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
the following table summarizes the calculation of ffo for the years ended december in thousands net income available for common shareholders adjustments depreciation and amortization company share of joint venture depreciation and amortization earnings from depreciable property sales wholly owned earnings from depreciable property sales share of joint venture minority interest share of adjustments funds from operations throughout  we continued to maintain a conservative balance sheet and investment grade debt ratings from moody s baa  standard poors bbb and fitch bbb 
our debt to total market capitalization ratio total market capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding common and preferred shares and units of limited partner interest in our operating partnership plus outstanding indebtedness of at december  compared to at december  continues to provide us financial flexibility to fund new investments 
highlights of our debt financing activity in are as follows in january  we retired a million variable rate term loan 
in march  we retired million of senior unsecured debt that matured 
in may  we obtained a million variable rate term loan 
the proceeds from this term loan were used to finance a property portfolio acquisition 
the loan was paid off in september with proceeds from the industrial portfolio sale 
in september  we retired million of corporate unsecured debt that matured 
on the equity side of our balance sheet  we repurchased approximately million common shares totaling nearly million during the third and fourth quarters of with the added liquidity from the industrial portfolio sale  we pursued a prudent repurchase program to supplement our other value creation activities 
in addition to steady operating performance and prudent balance sheet management during  we continued to effectively execute our capital recycling program and began several key initiatives and projects to leverage our development and construction capabilities as follows we disposed of over billion of older  non strategic  held for investment properties and used the proceeds to help fund over million of acquisitions and pay down our operating line of credit 
most significantly  we completed the industrial portfolio sale in september receiving net proceeds of million 
this portfolio consisted of over million square feet comprised of properties across eight duke markets as well as acres of undeveloped land 
portions of the proceeds were used to pay down million of outstanding debt on our million unsecured line of credit and million term loan 
this transaction was a continuation of our long term strategy of recycling assets into higher yielding new developments 
within the industrial side of our business  it also positions our ownership focus toward newly developed bulk warehouse properties 
we completed over million of acquisitions in  including a million suburban office portfolio in our chicago market 
the portfolio consisted of five office buildings totaling million square feet 
we increased our investment in undeveloped land to provide greater opportunities to use our development and construction expertise in the improving economic cycle 
throughout  we completed land acquisitions totaling over million 
the new land positions include industrial  office and retail positions in florida where we intend to develop a retail lifestyle center with a joint venture partner and continue office and industrial development in broward county 
our national development and construction group  which was formed in to pursue development and construction opportunities with companies that have a national presence including those outside our core markets  completed a successful year that included the awarding of a  square foot office building development in buffalo  new york 
the project is pre leased to a single tenant with construction expected to be completed in mid the national development and construction group also experienced significant growth of its healthcare business 
in  we created a strategic agreement with bremner healthcare  a developer of medical office and healthcare related facilities  to jointly develop and sell medical facilities throughout the united states 
bremner develops  leases and manages the facilities while we provide construction financing and general contractor services 
we share in the profits upon sale of the projects 
in  we completed our first project in this venture  a medical office building in indianapolis  indiana that was sold in september as of december   we have six additional healthcare development projects underway  totaling nearly  square feet 
we announced our intentions to enter the phoenix  arizona and houston  texas markets 
we believe these markets provide significant growth opportunities in the future and have similar demographics and components that our existing markets provide 
finally  we will continue to develop long term investment assets to be held in our portfolio  develop assets to be sold upon completion and perform third party construction projects 
with nearly million in our development pipeline at december   we are encouraged about the long term growth opportunities in our business 
significant activity we have continued to build on our momentum from by announcing the following significant transactions in early in january  we announced the acquisition of approximately million square feet of bulk industrial properties located at the port of savannah for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the portfolio consists of buildings and is located near one of the fastest growing ports in the country 
the properties are leased with a weighted average lease term of years 
this transaction makes us the largest industrial property owner in the savannah area and complements our industrial holdings across the southeast 
in addition  we have the option to acquire future completed development projects on acres of land in the same market 
in january  we issued million of series m cumulative redeemable preferred stock  which replaced our million series i cumulative redeemable preferred stock that we redeemed in february in january  we renewed our unsecured revolving credit facility 
the new facility provides borrowing capacity up to billion and  subject to certain conditions  may be increased to billion 
under the new facility  which replaces the previous unsecured line of credit agreement  we reduced the interest rate by basis points to libor plus basis points  increased the borrowing capacity by million and extended the maturity date to january  in february  we issued million of senior notes due in february  we acquired suburban office and light industrial buildings  encompassing more than million square feet from the mark winkler company for million 
the buildings are part of a building portfolio located in three primary submarkets in northern virginia 
we will close on the remaining five buildings in the portfolio throughout the first and second quarters of in addition to the buildings we also closed on approximately acres of undeveloped land located in major business parks that can support the future development of approximately million square feet of office and industrial buildings 
in connection with the acquisition  we obtained a million secured term loan priced at libor plus basis points with a scheduled maturity date of september subject to lender s approval  the maturity date may be extended to march key performance indicators our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our office  industrial and retail properties rental operations 
the following highlights the areas of rental operations that we consider critical for future revenue growth 
all square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect both wholly owned properties and properties in joint ventures 
occupancy analysis as discussed above  our ability to maintain occupancy rates is a principal driver of our results of operations 
the following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in service portfolio of rental properties as of december  and in thousands  except percentage data total percent of square feet total square feet percent occupied type industrial service centers bulk office retail total the overall improvement in occupancy was driven by a number of factors  but the most significant factor was the volume of leasing activity for the year 
we experienced significant activity in the fourth quarter of when we signed nearly million square feet of new leases and renewals  which was the highest quarterly leasing activity in our history 
our industrial and office product types both showed improvement in occupancy and activity in our markets was strong in lease expiration and renewals our ability to maintain and grow occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re lease expiring space 
the following table reflects our in service lease expiration schedule by property type as of december  the table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents based on december rental revenue under expiring leases in thousands  except percentage data total portfolio industrial office retail square ann

our lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent at a success rate 
we do not expect this renewal percentage in to differ from that experienced in the average term of renewals increased to years in from years in the increase in the average term is due to competitive market conditions with tenants seeking longer leases at attractive rates 
future development another source of growth in earnings is the development of additional properties 
these properties should provide future earnings through service operations income upon sale or from rental operations growth as they are placed in service 
we had million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of million at december   compared to million square feet and total costs of million at december  we have increased our development pipeline significantly through as we focus on the development side of our business in we have assessed our markets and determined that between growing demand and the pricing of acquisitions  we can utilize our development expertise and achieve better returns on our own developments 
the significant leasing activity experienced in the fourth quarter of as noted above has provided momentum heading into the following table summarizes our properties under development as of december  in thousands  except percentage data anticipated anticipated in service square percent project stabilized date feet leased costs return held for rental st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter merchant buildings st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter total acquisition and disposition activity in  we continued our capital recycling program by disposing over billion of older  non strategic properties 
most significantly  we completed the industrial portfolio sale for nearly million 
the industrial portfolio sale consisted of over million square feet of primarily light distribution and service center properties comprised of properties across eight of our markets 
the industrial portfolio sale was a continuation of our strategy of recycling assets into higher yielding new developments 
within the industrial side of our business  it also positions our ownership focus toward newly developed bulk warehouse properties 
see further discussion of the industrial portfolio sale in the year in review section 
as we focus on development in  we will continue to dispose of older assets  but do not anticipate the activity to be comparable to the dispositions activity of on the acquisitions side  we completed over million of acquisitions in  including a million suburban office portfolio in our chicago market 
the portfolio consists of five office buildings totaling million square feet 
results of operations a summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended december   follows in thousands  except number of properties and per share data rental operations revenues from continuing operations service operations revenues from continuing operations earnings from continuing rental operations earnings from continuing service operations operating income net income available for common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common and dilutive potential common shares basic income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations diluted income per common share continuing operation discontinued operations number of in service properties at end of year in service square footage at end of year under development square footage at end of year comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental income from continuing operations overall  rental income from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table reconciles rental income from continuing operations by reportable segment to total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended december  and in thousands office industrial non segment total both of our reportable segments that comprise rental operations office and industrial are within the real estate industry  however  the same economic and industry conditions do not affect each segment in the same manner 
the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below in  we have acquired nine new properties and placed development projects in service 
these acquisitions and developments are the primary factor in the million overall increase in rental revenue for the year ended  compared to the nine property acquisitions provided revenues of million 
these acquisitions totaled million on million square feet and were leased at december  revenues from acquisitions that occurred in grew to million in compared to million in developments placed in service in provided revenues of million 
revenues from developments placed in service in increased million to million in our in service occupancy increased from at december   to at december  rental income includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees in continued to steadily decrease as a result of improving market conditions 
lease termination fees decreased from million in to million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
these earnings increased from million in to million in during the second quarter of  one of our ventures sold three buildings with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling million 
rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses office industrial non segment total real estate taxes office industrial non segment total rental and real estate tax expenses for  as compared to  have increased as a result of our and acquisitions as well as our increase in occupancy 
this increase in rental and real estate taxes continues to be in line with our expectations 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in  as a result of increased debt levels and higher interest rates 
since august  we had the following debt issuances and redemptions in august  we issued million of unsecured notes due in in december  we issued million of unsecured floating rate debt at basis points over libor 
in march  we paid off million of senior unsecured notes 
in may  we obtained a million term loan at basis points over libor 
this loan was used to temporarily finance the acquisition of five office properties located in our chicago market 
in september  we repaid the million term loan  as well as million of corporate unsecured debt  with proceeds from the industrial portfolio sale 
we assumed approximately million of secured debt in conjunction with property acquisitions in august and june interest expense on our unsecured line of credit totaled million in compared to million in we had million outstanding on the facility at december  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in as a result of increased capital spending associated with increased leasing  the additional basis resulting from acquisition and development activity and the application of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations sfas as described below 
the points below highlight the significant increase in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense on tenant improvements increased by approximately million 
depreciation expense on buildings increased by million 
lease commission amortization expense increased by million 
the amortization expense associated with acquired lease intangible assets increased by approximately million 
the acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with sfas  which requires the allocation of a portion of a property s purchase price to intangible assets for leases acquired and in place at the closing date of the acquisition 
these intangible assets are amortized over the remaining life of the leases generally years as compared to the building basis portion of the acquisition  which is depreciated over years 
service operations service operations primarily consist of our merchant building sales and the leasing  management  construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
these operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations 
service operations earnings increased from million in to million in the increase reflects higher construction volumes partially offset by increased staffing costs for our expanded national development and construction group in other factors impacting service operations are discussed below 
our merchant building development and sales program  whereby a building is developed by us and then sold  is a significant component of construction and development income 
during  we generated after tax gains of million from the sale of properties compared to million from the sale of six properties in profit margins on these types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold  the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale  such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market 
in  we experienced an increase in our third party construction business as evidenced by the increase in general contractor revenues in over we achieved a slight increase in our profit margins during  which reflects improved pricing in certain markets and our ability to select more profitable projects as resources are re positioned to our increasing held for investment development pipeline 
in the first quarter of  we recognized million of a deferred gain associated with the sale of our landscaping operations in the gain was deferred as a result of future performance provisions contained in the original sales agreement 
as a result of contract renegotiations effective in the first quarter of  all future performance provisions were removed and the deferred gain was recognized 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses are comprised of two components 
the first is direct expenses that are not attributable to specific assets such as legal fees  external audit fees  marketing costs  investor relations expenses and other corporate overhead 
the second component is the unallocated overhead costs associated with the operation of our owned properties and service operations  including construction  leasing and maintenance operations 
overhead costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of an increase in payroll expenses associated with long term compensation plans and an increase in the number of employees to support our growth in our national development and construction practice 
other income and expenses earnings from the sale of land and ownership interests in unconsolidated companies  net of impairment adjustments  are comprised of the following amounts in and  respectively in thousands gain on land sales gain on sale of ownership interests in unconsolidated companies impairment adjustment total gain on land sales is derived from sales of undeveloped land that we own 
we pursue opportunities to dispose of land in those markets with a high concentration of undeveloped land and in those markets where the land no longer meets our strategic development plans 
we recorded  and  of impairment charges associated with contracts to sell land parcels for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all parcels related to the  of impairment recorded in were sold during one of the parcels on which we recorded an impairment charge in was sold in the first quarter of  while all remaining parcels of the  impairment charge were sold in discontinued operations the results of operations for properties sold during the year or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues  rental expenses  real estate taxes  interest expense  depreciation expense and minority interest  as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties 
we have classified operations of buildings as discontinued operations as of december  these buildings consist of industrial  office and five retail properties 
as a result  we classified net income from operations  net of minority interest  of million  million and million as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these properties  were sold during  properties were sold during  properties were sold during and three operating properties are classified as held for sale at december  the gains on disposal of these properties  net of impairment adjustment and minority interest  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are also reported in discontinued operations 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental income from continuing operations rental income from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table reconciles rental income from continuing operations by reportable segment to total reported rental income from continuing operations for the years ended december  and in thousands office industrial non segment total both of our reportable segments that comprise rental operations office and industrial are within the real estate industry  however  the same economic and industry conditions do not affect each segment in the same manner 
the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below our in service occupancy increased from at december   to at december  during the year ended  we acquired new properties and placed development projects in service 
these acquisitions and developments are the primary factors in the overall million increase in rental revenue for the year ended  compared to the same period in the property acquisitions totaled million on million square feet and were leased at december  the two largest acquisitions were office buildings in atlanta and cincinnati 
the acquisitions provided revenues of million 
revenues from acquisitions that occurred during were million in compared to million in developments placed in service in provided revenues of million  while revenues associated with developments placed in service in totaled million in compared to million in the rental income shown above includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees totaled million in  compared to million in the decrease in termination fees corresponds with fewer corporate downsizings due to improving market conditions 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
these earnings decreased from million in to million in despite overall occupancy remaining relatively flat around 
the decrease in earnings is the result of the following a tenant filed for bankruptcy in one joint venture property resulting in occupancy for the property at the end of being versus in we sold our interest in one joint venture in december and  as a result  no earnings were recorded in rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations for the years ended december  and in thousands rental expenses office industrial non segment total real estate taxes office industrial non segment total the increased rental and real estate tax expenses for  as compared to  were primarily the result of our increase in average in service square feet and occupancy 
these increases resulted from our acquisition activities and developments placed in service as noted above 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in we issued new debt to fund debt maturities  new developments and acquisitions and to take advantage of the favorable interest rate environment 
the following is a summary of debt activities for in january  we obtained a million floating rate term loan and immediately fixed the rate at with two interest rate swaps 
we paid off this loan in the first quarter of also in january  we issued million of unsecured debt with a four year maturity at 
in august we issued million of unsecured debt with a ten year maturity at an effective rate of 
in december we issued million of unsecured floating rate debt at basis points over libor 
the debt matures in two years  but is callable at our option after six months 
in august  we paid off million of a million secured floating rate term loan 
we also assumed million of secured debt in conjunction with a property acquisition in atlanta 
the average balance and average borrowing rate of our million revolving credit facility were slightly higher in than in at the end of  we were not utilizing our credit facility 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in as a result of increased capital spending associated with increased leasing  the additional basis resulting from acquisition and development activity and the application of sfas the points below highlight the significant increase in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation expense on tenant improvements increased by million 
depreciation expense on buildings increased by million 
lease commission amortization expense increased by million 
the amortization expense associated with acquired lease intangible assets increased by approximately million 
service operations service operations earnings increased from million in to million in the increase reflects higher construction volumes partially offset by increased staffing costs for our new national development and construction group and construction jobs in certain markets 
other factors impacting service operations are discussed below 
we experienced a decrease in our overall gross profit margin percentage in our general contractor business in as compared to  due to continued competitive pricing pressure in many of our markets 
we expect margins to increase in as economic conditions improve 
however  despite this decrease  we were able to increase our net general contractor revenues from million in to million in because of an increase in volume 
this volume increase was attributable to continued low financing costs available to businesses  thereby making it more attractive for them to own instead of lease facilities 
we have a substantial backlog of million for third party construction as of december   which was carried into our merchant building development and sales program  whereby a building is developed by us and then sold  is a significant component of construction and development income 
during  we generated after tax gains of million from the sale of six properties compared to million from the sale of four properties in profit margins on these types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold  the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale  such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in the increase was a result of increased staffing and employee compensation costs to support development of our national development and construction group 
we also experienced an increase in marketing to support certain new projects 
other income and expenses earnings from sales of land and ownership interests in unconsolidated companies  net of impairment adjustments  is comprised of the following amounts in and in thousands gain on land sales gain on sale of ownership interests in unconsolidated companies impairment adjustment total in the first quarter of  we sold our interest in a joint venture that owned and operated depreciable investment property 
the joint venture developed and operated real estate assets  thus  the gain was not included in operating income 
gain on land sales are derived from sales of undeveloped land owned by us 
we pursue opportunities to dispose of land in markets with a high concentration of undeveloped land and in those markets where the land no longer meets our strategic development plans 
the increase was partially attributable to a land sale to a current corporate tenant for potential future expansion 
we recorded  and  of impairment charges associated with contracts to sell land parcels for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   only one parcel on which we recorded impairment charges was still owned by us 
we sold this parcel in the first quarter of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures we analyze our investments in joint ventures under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation 
to the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities  we further assess under the guidelines of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures  accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements and fasb no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  to determine if the venture should be consolidated 
we have equity interests ranging from in joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or substantial participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
we use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial polices 
under the equity method of accounting  our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet  however  the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated with and incremental to the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
the following discusses the significant categories of costs we incur within our rental operations  direct and indirect costs are capitalized under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects sfas  and interest costs are capitalized under the guidelines of sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost sfas 
we capitalize these project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry 
the interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt 
in addition  we capitalize costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
we cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains a occupancy 
we follow guidelines in sfas and sfas in determining the capitalization of project costs during the lease up period of a property and believe that this treatment is consistent with real estate industry standards for project cost capitalization 
all direct construction and development costs associated with the development of a new property are capitalized 
in addition  all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
a portion of our indirect costs considered directly related and incremental to construction development and leasing efforts are capitalized 
in assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized  we first allocate payroll costs  on a department by department basis  among activities for which capitalization is warranted ie  construction  development and leasing and those for which capitalization is not warranted ie  property management  maintenance  acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions 
to the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities  the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity 
once the payroll costs are allocated  the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs 
to ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized  the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed 
these standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease 
these standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity 
the use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized by us 
impairment of real estate investments we evaluate our real estate investments upon occurrence of significant changes in the operations  but not less than annually  to assess whether any impairment indications are present that affect the recovery of the recorded value 
if any real estate investment is considered to be impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we utilize the guidelines established under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  to determine if impairment conditions exist 
under sfas  we review the expected undiscounted cash flows of each property in our held for rental portfolio to determine if there are any indications of impairment of a property 
the review of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value 
in addition to reviewing anticipated cash flows  we assess other factors such as changes in business climate and legal factors that may affect the ultimate value of the property 
these assumptions are subjective and the anticipated cash flows may not ultimately be achieved 
real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value amount or the fair value less estimated cost to sell 
acquisition of real estate property in accordance with sfas  we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets buildings  tenant improvements and land is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet  both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values  based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform in house credit review and analysis on major existing tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
we have established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances we maintain a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk 
various factors such as late rent payments  lease or debt instrument defaults  and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list 
as a matter of policy  we reserve the entire receivable balance  including straight line rent  of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk  regardless of the status of rent receivables  are reviewed and reserved as necessary 
revenue recognition on construction contracts we recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes 
with regard to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting  methodology in applying  and impact on the financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies we identified 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we expect to meet our liquidity requirements over the next twelve months  including payments of dividends and distributions as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to maintaining our current real estate assets  primarily through the following working capital  and net cash provided by operating activities 
although we typically do not use other sources of funds to pay for recurring capital expenditures on our current real estate investments  we may rely on the temporary use of borrowings or property disposition proceeds to fund such expenditures during periods of high leasing volume 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities  refinancing of long term debt  preferred share redemptions  the retirement of unsecured notes and amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit facility  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements  primarily from the following sources issuance of additional notes  issuance of additional preferred shares  undistributed cash provided by operating activities  if any  and proceeds received from real estate dispositions 
rental operations we believe our principal source of liquidity  cash flows from rental operations  provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses 
we believe this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 
we are subject to risks of decreased occupancy through market conditions as well as tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
however  we believe that these risks are mitigated by our strong market presence in most of our locations and the fact that we perform in house credit review and analysis on major tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
credit facility we had one unsecured line of credit available at december   summarized as follows in thousands borrowing maturity interest outstanding description capacity date rate at december  unsecured line of credit january libor 
we use this line of credit to fund development activities  acquire additional rental properties and provide working capital 
the line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line  at rates lower than the stated interest rate  subject to certain restrictions 
the line of credit contains various financial covenants that require us to meet defined levels of performance  including variable interest indebtedness  consolidated net worth  and debt to market capitalization 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our line of credit 
in january  we renewed our unsecured revolving credit facility 
the new facility provides borrowing capacity up to billion and  subject to certain conditions  may be increased to billion 
under the new facility  which replaces the previous unsecured line of credit agreement  we reduced the interest rate by basis points to libor plus basis points  increased the borrowing capacity by million and extended the maturity date to january  debt and equity securities at december   we had on file with the sec an effective shelf registration statement that permits us to sell up to an additional million of unsecured debt securities and an additional million of common and preferred stock 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional securities under these registration statements to fund development and acquisition of additional rental properties and to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long term debt upon maturity 
the indenture governing our unsecured notes also requires us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations 
at december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
sale of real estate assets we utilize sales of real estate assets as an additional source of liquidity 
we pursue opportunities to sell real estate assets at favorable prices to capture value created by us as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio by recycling sale proceeds into new properties with greater value creation opportunities 
uses of liquidity our principal uses of liquidity include the following property investments  recurring leasing capital costs  dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders  long term debt maturities  and other contractual obligations 
property investments we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook  supply and long term growth potential 
recurring expenditures one of our principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the development  acquisition and recurring leasing capital expenditures of our real estate investments 
the following is a summary of our recurring capital expenditures for the year ended december in thousands tenant improvements leasing costs building improvements totals recurring capital expenditures remained relatively stable for as compared to our lease renewal percentage remained steady in at compared to in dividends and distributions in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must currently distribute at least of our taxable income to shareholders

currently  fitch and standard and poor s have assigned a rating of bbb and moody s investors has assigned a rating of baa to our senior notes 
we also received investment grade credit ratings from the same rating agencies on our preferred stock 
fitch and standard and poor s have assigned a preferred stock rating of bbb and moody s investors has assigned a preferred stock rating of baa to our preferred stock 
these senior notes and preferred stock ratings could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
financial instruments we are exposed to capital market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
in order to manage the volatility relating to interest rate risk  we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time
