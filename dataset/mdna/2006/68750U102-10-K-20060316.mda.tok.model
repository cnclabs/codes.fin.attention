item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  included in this report for a discussion of significant contractual arrangements relating to i our joint product development and commercialization arrangements  ii our distribution arrangements and iii our revenue sharing arrangement 
our research development we employ composite engineering  polymer science  solution chemistry and nanoparticulate ceramic glass science to create our biomaterials technology platforms 
we then utilize biomaterials  those developed on our own and jointly with kensey  to develop  synthetic  biologically active products engineered to restore the human skeleton 
patents have been issued and additional patent applications have been filed to protect our key biomaterial developments 
see patents and proprietary intellectual property below for additional information 
we incurred approximately   and  in research and development expenses in  and  respectively 
patents and proprietary intellectual property our strategy is to seek protection for our product technologies and manufacturing methods through the use of us and foreign patents 
we have filed or intend to file applications as appropriate for patents covering our 
table of contents technologies  products and processes 
as of the date of this filing  the products we have developed and marketed are covered by one or more of our eighteen issued us patents  thirteen pending us patent applications and numerous counterparts of certain of these patents and pending patent applications outside the us  including canada  europe  mexico and japan 
our patents are set to expire between and  however  certain of our patents may be extendable under united states code  which pertains to the extension of the patent term 
manufacturing and product supply the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by various regulatory bodies for compliance with current fda quality system regulations and requirements  and eu mdd international organization for standardization iso series standards and equivalent requirements 
our  square foot vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss manufacturing facilities which produce our commercial products  are leased through july and are certified as meeting the requirements of iso for the period march  through march   and european norm en for the period july  through july  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
the most recent fda inspection resulted in no corrective actions being required 
we believe our manufacturing facilities have the capacity to meet our commercial needs for the next several years 
we are manufacturing vitagel  cellpaker  imbibe  endoskeleton ta  and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our vitoss bone graft substitute is converted to vitoss foam by kensey  our development partner under a long term supply agreement 
our third party manufacturers are iso certified or otherwise meet our quality system requirements see government regulation below 
in addition to the need for cortoss us regulatory approval in order to commercialize cortoss in the us  the cortoss manufacturing facility and quality assurance system must pass inspection by the fda 
angiotech decided to cease to manufacture vitagel by november  therefore  in october  we purchased all available existing products  accessories and work in process from angiotech for  which is expected to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through mid additionally  on november   we submitted a duplicate pma for vitagel to the fda through a grant of license from angiotech to reference their pma 
fda approval of the pma submitted by us  if obtained  will allow us to sell vitagel product that is manufactured on site in our malvern  pennsylvania facility 
as of december   we had included in inventory vitagel valued at  that was manufactured on site at our malvern facility 
we have no assurance that we will obtain fda approval to sell vitagel manufactured by us prior to our current supply of vitagel being exhausted 
we may not have sufficient inventory of vitagel during the second half of to support customer demand 
our ability to manufacture our products is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
we have a long term supply agreement which provides bovine collagen for the manufacture of vitagel  however  we do not have any other long term supply agreements for raw materials 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to continue to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with royalty securitization trust i royalty trust and successor in interest to paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp  which is described below in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue interests 

table of contents sales and marketing in june  we began to assemble a us field sales network of direct sales representatives and independent sales agencies in order to market vitoss bone graft substitute  vitagel and imbibe bone marrow aspirate and delivery device 
we continually seek to strengthen our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us sales territories where either we do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are under served 
outside of the us  we primarily utilize a network of independent  stocking distributors to market vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss  and aliquot micro delivery system 
competition extensive research efforts and rapid technological change characterize the market for products in the orthopedic market 
we face intense competition from medical device  biomedical technology  and medical products companies 
our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete by competitors technological advances 
we may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
these competitors may also be in the process of seeking fda or other regulatory approvals  or patent protection  for new products 
our competitors could  therefore  commercialize new competing products in advance of our products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe vitoss bone graft substitute faces competition from numerous synthetic and cadaver based products currently on the market as well as other products and technologies that may enter the market in the future 
in  total disk replacement devices tdr s were introduced in the spinal market as a treatment alternative for degenerative disk disease designed to preserve the motion of the vertebrae of the spine 
we believe that several factors mitigate against the broad use of tdr s  including the need for surgeon training  the high level of surgeon technical skills required  surgeon concern regarding the challenges of tdr revision surgery should that become necessary due to loosening or subsidence of the device over time  and procedure reimbursement 
it is too early to estimate the rate at which the market will ultimately adopt this or comparable technology as a treatment alternative or its resulting impact on our products 
vitagel is approved by the fda as a surgical hemostat where bleeding may be a significant complication for many routine surgeries 
as such  vitagel can be marketed broadly to general surgeons and is applicable in the spine  hip and knee replacement surgery markets 
vitagel faces competition from several more established surgical hemostat products marketed by other companies with substantially greater resources than us 
however  we believe vitagel offers unique advantages in comparison to these other products in terms of vitagel s quick and easy preparation for use  as well as its use of the patient s autologous plasma  instead of pooled donated human plasma as is the case with the leading products in the market 
cortoss is under clinical development in the us for use in the vertebral augmentation of vcfs and has received a ce certification for use in the vertebral augmentation of vcfs and in screw augmentation 
if cortoss is approved by the fda for use in the vertebral augmentation of vcfs  it will face competition from the several pmma bone cement products that have been k cleared by the fda since for this indication 
outside the us  cortoss is facing competition from several other pmma bone cement products that have received ce certification since for this indication 
we do not know of any products that have received fda approval or a ce certification for use in screw augmentation or for which such approval is being sought 

table of contents government regulation in order to market our products  we must apply for  be granted and maintain all necessary regulatory approvals  clearances  and certifications 
in addition  we must comply with all regulatory requirements in each applicable jurisdiction 
to date  we have received k regulatory clearance  as described below  for vitoss bone graft substitute in the us from the fda in december and the ce certification in the eu from our notified body in july in march  we also received regulatory approval to sell vitoss bone graft substitute in australia  and in june  we received regulatory approval to sell vitoss bone graft substitute in canada 
the ce certification permits us to sell our approved products in all of the countries of the eu as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel  that have adopted the eu s regulatory standards 
we received k regulatory clearance for vitoss canisters and vitoss foam in november and december  respectively  in the us from the fda 
in september  we received k regulatory clearance in the us from the fda to market our imbibe product for use as a bone marrow aspiration syringe 
we received ce certification for cortoss in october in the eu and regulatory approval in march in australia  which enables us to sell cortoss in these territories for use in securing the fixation of bone screws in patients with weak bone caused by osteoporosis 
in addition  during january our ce certification was extended to enable us to market cortoss in the eu for vertebral augmentation of vcfs  including compression fractures of the spine caused by osteoporosis and invasive tumors 
during the second quarter of  we received ce certification from our notified body for aliquot 
during and  we completed patient enrollment of two fda approved ide pilot clinical studies in the us for the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation of vcfs using the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty surgical techniques  respectively 
both surgical techniques involve the injection of a self setting material into the vertebral body to provide internal fixation of the vcf 
upon fda review of the vertebroplasty pilot clinical data  we received approval from fda to begin patient enrollment in a patient prospective  randomized control pivotal phase of that clinical study 
the study design was subsequently amended and approved by the fda in august to allow the comparison of cortoss to a treatment arm using pmma bone cement instead of a non treatment arm consisting of conservative care and pain management 
in november  the study design was further amended and approved by the fda to lower the waiting period from six to four weeks for patients experiencing pain before enrolling in our clinical study and to allow for an exception to this criterion if the treating surgeon has determined that the patient has experienced a progression of vertebral collapse that exceeds 
we do not expect to receive fda approval for the sale of cortoss in the us for at least the next couple of years  if at all 
in december  we received k regulatory clearance for our endoskeleton ta product platform in the us from the fda 
the following discussion summarizes the regulatory requirements applicable to our products 
united states the medical devices that we manufacture and market  or intend to market  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
pursuant to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act ffd c act and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals clearances and criminal prosecution 

table of contents in the us  medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i  ii or iii on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably assure their safety and effectiveness 
under fda regulations  class i devices  the least regulated category  are subject to general controls and class ii devices are subject to general and special controls 
generally  class iii devices are those that must receive premarket approval by the fda to ensure their safety and effectiveness 
before we can introduce a new device into the market  we must generally obtain market clearance through a k notification or premarket approval through a premarket approval application pma 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or ii medical device  or to a class iii medical device for which the fda has not required a pma 
the fda may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
a request for additional data may require that clinical studies be performed to establish the device s substantial equivalence 
commercial distribution of a device for which a k notification is required can begin only after the fda issues a letter finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a predicate device 
pursuant to the ffd c act  the fda must make a determination with respect to a k submission within days of its receipt 
the fda may  and often does  extend this time frame by requesting additional data or information 
a not substantially equivalent determination  or a request for additional information  could delay or prevent the market introduction of new products for which we file such notifications 
for any of our products that are cleared through the k process  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new k submissions 
the fda has implemented a policy under which certain device modifications may be submitted as a special k  which will require only a day review 
special k s are limited to those device modifications that do not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device and for which substantial equivalence can be demonstrated through design controls 
we must file a pma if our proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or if it is a class iii preamendment device on the market since prior to may  for which fda has called for pmas 
a pma must be supported by valid scientific evidence that typically includes extensive data  including pre clinical and clinical trial data  to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device  as well as extensive manufacturing information 
fda review of a pma generally takes one to two years from the date the pma is accepted for filing  but may take significantly longer 
the review time is often significantly extended should the fda ask for more information or clarification of information already provided in the submission 
during the pma review period  an advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  will likely be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to whether the device should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory panel 
toward the end of the pma review process  the fda generally will conduct an inspection of the manufacturer s facilities to ensure that they are in compliance with quality system regulation qsr requirements 
if the fda s evaluations of both the pma and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the pma 
when  and if  those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the fda  the agency will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications 
if the fda s evaluation of the pma or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda will deny approval of the pma or issue a not approvable letter 
the fda may also determine that 
table of contents additional clinical trials are necessary  in which case pma approval may be delayed up to several years while we conduct additional clinical trials and submit an amendment to the pma 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and a number of devices for which other companies have sought fda approval have never been approved for marketing 
modifications to a device that is the subject of an approved pma including modifications to its labeling or manufacturing process may require approval by the fda of pma supplements or new pmas 
supplements to a pma often require the submission of the same type of information required for an initial pma  except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original pma 
if clinical trials of a device are required in connection with either a k notification or a pma and the device presents a significant risk  we will be required to file an ide application prior to commencing clinical trials 
the ide application must be supported by data  typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing 
if the ide application is reviewed and approved by the fda and one or more appropriate institutional review boards irbs  clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients  as approved by the fda 
if the device presents a non significant risk to the patient  we may begin the clinical trials after obtaining approval for the study by one or more appropriate irbs  but not the fda 
for significant risk devices  we must submit an ide supplement to the fda and receive approval from the fda before we  or our investigator  may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness or the rights  safety or welfare of human subjects 
irb approval may be required for changes in the investigational plan for both non significant risk and significant risk devices 
any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  including reporting and record keeping requirements 
device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
the most recent fda inspection resulted with no corrective actions being required 
the ffd c act requires devices to be manufactured in accordance with quality system regulation requirements that impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
medical devices are also subject to post market reporting requirements for deaths or serious injuries when the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury  and for certain device malfunctions that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of any approved or cleared product 
our labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved or uncleared uses 
we  as well as our products  are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed 
any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities 
we are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant the pre market clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals  clearances and criminal prosecution 

table of contents europe in order to sell our products within the eu  we are required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the mdd and affix a ce mark on our products to attest such compliance 
to achieve this  our products must meet the essential requirements defined under the mdd relating to safety and performance and we must successfully undergo a verification of our regulatory compliance conformity assessment by an independent notified body 
we have selected tno  the netherlands organization for applied science research  as our notified body 
the nature of the conformity assessment will depend on the regulatory class of our products 
under european law  our products  other than imbibe and aliquot which are class i sterile and class ii a  respectively  are likely to be in class iii 
in the case of class iii products  we must as a result of the regulatory structure which we have elected to follow establish and maintain a complete quality system for design and manufacture as described in annex ii of the mdd and demonstrated by compliance with the iso and en standards for 
we are certified as meeting the requirements of iso for the period march  through march   and en for the period july  through july  our notified body has audited our quality system and determined that it meets the requirements of the mdd 
in addition  the notified body must approve the specific design of each device in class iii and iia 
as part of the design approval process  the notified body must also verify that the products comply with the essential requirements of the mdd 
in order to comply with these requirements  we must  among other things  complete a risk analysis and may be required to present clinical data 
the clinical data presented by us must provide evidence that the products meet the performance specifications claimed by us  provide sufficient evidence of adequate assessment of unwanted side effects and demonstrate that the benefits to the patient outweigh the risks associated with the device 
we are subject to continued surveillance by the notified body and will be required to report any serious adverse incidents to the appropriate authorities 
we also will be required to comply with additional national requirements that are beyond the scope of the mdd 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 
third party reimbursement successful sales of our products in the us and other markets will depend on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payers relative to our products 
in the us  health care providers  such as hospitals and physicians that purchase or utilize our products for treatment of their patients  generally rely on independent third party payers  such as private insurance companies or hmos  and governmental payers  such as medicare and medicaid to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the provision of items and services using our products 
physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these payers for the cost of procedures using our products 
each payer has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product 
private payers often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations 
therefore  achieving favorable medicare coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product 
medicare is a federally funded program managed by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers  that administers coverage and reimbursement for certain health care items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled 
medicaid is an insurance program for the poor that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state 
the federal government sets general guidelines for medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern their individual program 
medicare provides  among other things  health care benefits that cover  within prescribed limits  the major costs of most medically necessary care for such individuals  subject to certain deductibles and co payments 
the medicare program has established  and continues to establish  standards and guidelines for the coverage and 
table of contents reimbursement of certain procedures  equipment  supplies and other items and services 
generally  in order to be covered and reimbursed by medicare  a health care item or service furnished to a medicare beneficiary must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body part 
the methodology for determining the coverage status of our products  and the amount of medicare reimbursement for our products  varies based upon  among other factors  the setting in which a medicare beneficiary received health care items and services 
acute care hospitals are generally reimbursed by medicare for inpatient operating costs based upon prospectively determined rates 
under the prospective payment system pps  acute care hospitals receive a predetermined payment rate based upon the diagnosis related group  or drg  into which each medicare beneficiary stay is assigned  regardless of the actual cost of the services provided 
certain additional or outlier payments may be made to a hospital for cases involving unusually high costs 
accordingly  acute care hospitals generally do not receive direct medicare reimbursement under pps for the distinct costs incurred in purchasing the company s products 
rather  reimbursement for these costs is deemed to be included within the drg based payments made to hospitals for the services furnished to medicare eligible inpatients in which our products are utilized 
because pps payments are based on predetermined rates and may be less than a hospital s actual costs in furnishing care  acute care hospitals have incentives to lower their inpatient operating costs by utilizing equipment  devices and supplies  including those sold by us  that will reduce the length of inpatient stays  decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs 
our product revenue could be affected negatively if acute care hospitals discontinue product use due to insufficient reimbursement  or if other treatment options are perceived to be more cost effective 
medicare also reimburses most outpatient services based on a prospective or predetermined payment basis  subject to certain exceptions and limitations 
similarly  some states reimburse certain health care providers for inpatient services under their medicaid programs by using prospective rates for diagnosis related groups of illnesses 
therefore  health care providers may refuse to use our products if coverage or reimbursement is inadequate 
also  any changes in federal legislation  regulations and policy affecting medicare coverage and reimbursement relative to our products could have a material effect on our results of operations 
inadequate coverage or reimbursement by private insurance companies and government programs could significantly reduce usage of our products 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the us has placed  and we believe will continue to place  greater pressure on medical device pricing 
such pressures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products profitably 
failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain favorable coverage or reimbursement from third party payers or changes in governmental and private third party payers policies toward coverage or reimbursement for procedures employing our products could reduce demand for our products 
member countries of the eu operate various combinations of centrally financed health care systems and private health insurance systems 
the relative importance of government and private systems varies from country to country 
the choice of devices is subject to constraints imposed by the availability of funds within the purchasing institution 
medical devices are most commonly sold to hospitals or health care facilities at a price set by negotiation between the buyer and the seller 
a contract to purchase products may result from an individual initiative or as a result of a competitive bidding process 
in either case  the purchaser pays the supplier  and payment terms vary widely throughout the eu 
failure to obtain favorable negotiated prices with hospitals or health care facilities could adversely affect sales of our products 
health care fraud and abuse laws to the extent our products receive government reimbursements  we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback laws and false claims laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal  civil and or administrative sanctions  including  in some instances  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs  including medicare  
table of contents medicaid and veterans health programs 
because of the far reaching nature of these laws  there can be no assurance that the occurrence of one or more violations of these laws would not result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
anti kickback laws 
to the extent that our products receive government reimbursement  our operations are subject to federal and state anti kickback laws 
certain provisions of the social security act prohibit entities such as us from knowingly and willingly offering  paying  soliciting or receiving any form of remuneration including any kickbacks  bribe or rebate in return for the referral of items or services for which payment may be made under a federal health care program  or in return for the recommendation  arrangement  purchase  lease or order of items or services for which payment may be made under a federal health care program 
violation of the federal anti kickback law is a felony  punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment for up to five years or both 
in addition  the department of health and human services may impose civil penalties and exclude violators from participation in federal health care programs such as medicare and medicaid 
many states have adopted similar prohibitions against payments intended to induce referrals of products or services paid by medicaid or other third party payors 
false claims 
the federal false claims act imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities who submit or cause the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government 
violations of the federal false claims act may result in penalties equal to three times the damages which the government sustained  an assessment of between  and  per claim  civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the federal false claims act also allows a private individual to bring a qui tam suit on behalf of the government against an individual or entity for violations of the false claims act 
in a qui tam suit  the private plaintiff is responsible for initiating a lawsuit that may eventually lead to the government recovering money of which it was defrauded 
after the private plaintiff has initiated the lawsuit  the government must decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and become the primary prosecutor 
in the event the government declines to join the lawsuit  the private plaintiff may choose to pursue the case alone  in which case the private plaintiff s counsel will have primary control over the prosecution although the government must be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit 
in return for bringing the suit on the government s behalf  the statute provides that the private plaintiff is entitled to receive up to of the recovered amount from the litigation proceeds if the litigation is successful plus reasonable expenses and attorneys fees 
recently  the number of qui tam suits brought against entities in the health care industry has increased dramatically 
in addition  a number of states have enacted laws modeled after the false claims act that allow those states to recover money which was fraudulently obtained from the state 
other fraud and abuse laws 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of created  in part  two new federal crimes health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters 
the health care fraud statute prohibits the knowing and willful execution of a scheme or artifice to defraud any health care benefit program 
a violation of the statute is a felony and may result in fines and or imprisonment 
the false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying  concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick  scheme or device or making any materially false  fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits  items or services 
a violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and or imprisonment 
product liability and insurance we manufacture medical devices used on patients in surgery  and we may be subject to product liability lawsuits 
we have experienced one product liability claim to date  which we have successfully defended 
there can be no assurance that other product liability claims will not be asserted against us in the future 
under certain of our agreements with our independent sales agencies and stocking distributors  we provide indemnification 
table of contents from product liability claims 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we would have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
we maintain product liability insurance in the annual aggregate amount of up to  although our insurance policies have various exclusions 
thus  we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no insurance coverage  in which case we may have to pay the entire amount of any award 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  with employees at our malvern  pennsylvania headquarters  employees throughout the us and employees in europe 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors if vitoss is not commercially successful in the united states or if cortoss and vitoss are not commercially successful in the european union  our operating results will be impaired 
we are highly dependent on successfully selling our products for which we have received regulatory approval or clearance 
we expect regulatory approvals or clearances in the united states for our products under development  if obtained at all  to take several years 
to date  we have received regulatory approval to market vitoss  cortoss and aliquot for specified uses in the european union  australia and countries adhering to the regulatory standards of the european union 
we have also received regulatory clearance to market vitoss and imbibe in the united states 
for these reasons  we are dependent upon vitoss and cortoss and their ancillary products  imbibe and aliquot  in their respective approved markets to generate sufficient revenues to sustain operations in the future 
these products have only been recently approved or cleared and launched  and the markets for our products are evolving 
accordingly  we cannot accurately predict either the future growth rate of product sales  if any  or the ultimate size of these markets 
certain factors that may limit our ability to increase sales include our dependence on the efforts of independent agents and distributors to promote the use of our products  over which we have limited control  the introduction of new products into the market by competing orthopedic companies based upon other competing technologies  our dependence on the continued publication of independent pre clinical and clinical data to support the use of our products  our need to train a sufficient number of surgeons to create demand for our products  and the need for payors to authorize insurance reimbursement for procedures using our products 
market acceptance of our products will largely depend on our ability to demonstrate their relative safety  efficacy  cost effectiveness and ease of use 
surgeons will not use our products unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and recommendations from prominent surgeons and mentors that our products are safe and effective 
our products are based on new technologies that have not been previously used and must compete with more established treatments currently accepted as the standards of care 
the attributes of some of our products may require some changes in surgical techniques that have become standard within the medical community  and there may be resistance to change 
therefore  for these products  we must be able to convince surgeons who currently favor existing techniques to switch to new procedures that would use our products 
many surgeons will not purchase our products until there is sufficient  long term clinical evidence to convince them to alter their existing treatment methods 
in addition  surgeons may be slow to change their medical treatment practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty 
table of contents of third party reimbursement for our products 
any failure to gain market acceptance of our products could result in lower sales and the inability to become profitable 
our plan to assume manufacturing of vitagel and its related products may not be successful or timely 
pursuant to our exclusive sales distribution agreement with angiotech  as amended  we expect to assume full manufacturing for the vitagel product upon approval from the fda of the pma we submitted in december there can be no assurance that we will receive fda approval to manufacture vitagel or that  even if approved  we will be able to comply with fda regulatory requirements to continue to manufacture vitagel  which could result in delay or inability to manufacture and sell the products 
there can be no assurance that we will receive any such approval prior to running out of the limited product we purchased to sell that was manufactured by angiotech prior to their shutting down their manufacturing facility in november if we are unable to operate an effective sales and distribution network  our ability to generate sales and become profitable will be impaired 
we have assembled a field sales network of independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives in the us in order to market vitoss bone graft substitute  vitagel and imbibe 
outside of the us  we utilize a network of independent stocking distributors to market vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and aliquot 
we seek to strengthen our field sales network through the addition of direct sales representatives in those us territories where we either do not have independent sales agency coverage or the territories are underserved 
we are dependent upon our distributors  sales agencies and direct sales representatives for the sale of our products 
any failure to maintain and effectively manage our distribution network will impair our ability to generate additional sales and become profitable 
there can be no assurance that the distributors and agencies will perform their obligations in their respective territories as expected  or that we will continue to derive any revenue from these arrangements 
we cannot assure that our interests will continue to coincide with those of our distributors and agencies 
in addition  we cannot assure that our distributors and agencies will not develop independently  or with other companies  other competitive products 
the independent us agencies selling vitoss bone graft substitute generally sell products from other orthopedic companies 
a single agency may sell vitoss bone graft substitute  as well as hardware manufactured by other orthopedic companies consisting of metal plates  screws and titanium spinal cages  to end user hospitals 
our sales could be adversely affected if  for any reason  one or more of our successful agencies lost their hardware product line provided by other orthopedic companies 
additionally  our independent agencies may be unable or unwilling to carry or effectively sell vitoss bone graft substitute as a result of the introduction of new products into the market based upon other technologies that could compete with vitoss bone graft substitute 
our sales could be adversely affected if one or more of our successful agencies eliminated vitoss bone graft substitute from their product line for any other reason and terminated their agency arrangement with us 
our sales could also be adversely affected if our independent agencies become concerned that their agency arrangement with us could be eliminated as a result of another company s offer or threat to acquire us 
the complete product line represented by the distributors and agencies  including our products  is an important factor in the distributors or agencies ability to penetrate the market 
accordingly  our ability to penetrate the markets that we intend to serve is highly dependent upon the quality and breadth of the other product lines carried by our distribution network  the components of which may change from time to time  and over which we have little or no control 

table of contents in an effort to further accelerate the growth of sales  we continue to build our sales management team and add direct sales representatives to our organization for certain open or underserved territories in the us the addition of direct sales representatives will increase our operating expenses 
furthermore  there is no assurance that adding direct sales representatives will improve sales or that our direct sales representatives will be successful in generating sufficient sales to cover the cost of supporting their sales activities 
there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to market or sell our products or that we will successfully implement this type of sales and distribution method 
the unapproved or off label use of our products could adversely affect the reputation of our products 
the medical devices that we manufacture and market  or intend to market  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda  the european union medical devices directive and other worldwide regulatory agencies 
in order to market our products  we must apply for  receive and maintain all necessary regulatory approvals or clearances in each applicable jurisdiction for specified uses of the products 
under fda regulations  we are only permitted to commercially distribute our products for approved indication s or use s  failure to comply with these regulations may subject us to fda enforcement action 
cortoss received ce certification  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives  in january for use in repairing vertebral compression fractures 
however  surgeons may have attempted to use cortoss off label in procedures to repair vertebral compression fractures performed prior to the european union s approval of cortoss for this type of procedure 
furthermore  all surgeons have not been trained in the proper use of cortoss to repair vertebral compression fractures since the european union only recently approved the use of cortoss for that type of procedure 
a surgeon who has not been properly trained to use cortoss in a procedure to repair vertebral compression fractures could pose a risk to the reputation of our cortoss product 
in addition  the occurrence of an adverse event while using our product off label in procedures other than the repair of vertebral compression fractures or screw augmentation could adversely affect the reputation of cortoss or any of our other products as well as us 
if we do not successfully train a sufficient number of surgeons  demand for our products could be adversely affected 
it is critical to the commercial success of our products that our independent distributors  agents and direct sales representatives succeed in training a sufficient number of surgeons and in providing them adequate instruction in the use of our products 
this training requires a commitment of time and money by surgeons that they may be unwilling to give 
even if surgeons are willing  if they are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
this may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury  negative publicity or lawsuits against us  any of which could damage our business and reduce product sales 
if health care providers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for procedures using our products  or if such reimbursement is inadequate  we may never become profitable 
successful sales of our products in the united states and other markets will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
healthcare providers  such as hospitals and surgeons that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients  generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
both public and private insurance reimbursement plans are central to new product acceptance 
healthcare providers may refuse to use our products if reimbursement is inadequate 
we do not yet know how reimbursement will be handled for all of our products because some procedures that use our products are new and reimbursement policies regarding these procedures have not been finalized 
inadequate reimbursement by private insurance companies and government programs could significantly reduce usage of our products 

table of contents in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has placed  and we believe will continue to place  greater pressure on medical device pricing 
such pressures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products profitably 
we could be negatively impacted by future interpretation or implementation of federal and state fraud and abuse laws  including anti kickback laws and false claims laws 
to the extent that our products receive government reimbursement  we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse  including anti kickback laws and false claims laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions  including  in some instances  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs  including medicare  medicaid  and veterans health programs 
we have not been challenged by a governmental authority under any of these laws and believe that our operations are in compliance with such laws 
health care fraud and abuse regulations are complex  and even minor  inadvertent irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that the law has been violated 
any violations of these laws could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if there is a change in law  regulation or administrative or judicial interpretations  we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could become subject to false claims litigation under federal or state statutes  which can lead to civil money penalties  criminal fines and imprisonment  and or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs 
these false claims statutes include the federal false claims act  which allows any person to bring suit alleging the false or fraudulent submission of claims for payment under federal programs or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement 
such suits  known as qui tam actions  have increased significantly in recent years and have increased the risk that companies like us may have to defend a false claim action 
we could also become subject to similar false claims litigation under state statutes 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any such action  such action may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need to raise additional capital 
if we are unable to raise additional capital in the future  our product development could be limited and our long term viability may be threatened  however  if we raise additional capital  your percentage ownership as a shareholder of orthovita will decrease and constraints could be placed on the operation of our business 
we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financings  or strategic alliances with third parties either alone or in combination with equity or debt financing investments 
there are factors that may cause our future capital requirements to be greater than anticipated or could accelerate our need for funds including  without limitation unforeseen developments during our pre clinical and clinical trials  delays in the timing of receipt of required regulatory approvals or clearances to make or sell products  unforeseen difficulties in operating an effective direct sales and distribution network  unanticipated expenditures in research and product development or manufacturing activities  delayed  insufficient or lack of market acceptance of our products  unanticipated expenditures in the acquisition and defense of intellectual property rights  the failure to develop strategic alliances for the marketing of some of our products  unforeseen changes in healthcare reimbursement for procedures using our products  
table of contents inability to increase sales of our approved or cleared products  inability to train a sufficient number of surgeons to create demand for our products  lack of financial resources to adequately support our operations  difficulties in maintaining commercial scale manufacturing capacity and capability  unforeseen problems with our third party manufacturers and service providers or with our specialty suppliers of certain raw materials  unanticipated difficulties in operating in international markets  inability to meet our obligations under our revenue sharing agreement  the need to respond to technological changes and increased competition  unforeseen problems in attracting and retaining qualified personnel to market our products  enactment of new legislation or administrative regulation  the application to our business of new court decisions and regulatory interpretations  claims that might be brought in excess of our insurance coverage  any imposition of penalties for failure to comply with regulatory guidelines  or management s perception that uncertainties relating to these factors may be increasing 
in addition  although we have no present commitments or understandings to do so  we may seek to expand our operations and product line through acquisitions or joint ventures 
any such acquisitions or joint ventures may increase our capital requirements 
if we fail to obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals or clearances necessary to make or sell our products  sales could be delayed or never realized 
the jurisdictions in which we seek to market our products will regulate these products as medical devices 
in most circumstances  we and our distributors and agents must obtain regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications and otherwise comply with extensive regulations regarding safety  quality and efficacy standards 
these regulations vary from country to country  and the regulatory review can be lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
we may not obtain or maintain the regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications necessary to make or market our products in our targeted markets 
moreover  regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications that are obtained may involve significant restrictions on the anatomic sites and types of procedures for which our products can be used 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications 
if we do not obtain or maintain regulatory clearances  approvals and certifications to enable us to make or market our products in the us or elsewhere  or if the clearances  approvals and certifications are subject to significant restrictions  we may never generate significant revenues 
the regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we currently market or intend to market our products are summarized below 
united states regulation by fda 
the fda regulates the clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
to date  we have received k clearance from the fda to market our vitoss bone graft substitute and imbibe labels 
during and  we received approval from the fda to conduct two pilot clinical studies in the us to study the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation 
the two pilot clinical studies are fully enrolled and we expect those trials to be completed by the end of during  we received approval from the fda to conduct a pivotal clinical study in the us to further study the use of cortoss in vertebral augmentation using the vertebroplasty surgical technique 
we are still in the process of completing enrollment of the pivotal clinical study 
there can be no assurance that the data from these clinical trials will support fda clearance or approval to market this product for the designated use 
we are currently manufacturing vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss in the us  distributing vitoss bone graft substitute  vitagel and imbibe in the us  and distributing vitoss bone graft 
table of contents substitute  cortoss and aliquot outside the us we are manufacturing imbibe and aliquot in the us through outside third party contract manufacturers 
in addition  under our agreement  kensey has the exclusive right to manufacture any approved or cleared jointly developed products under the agreement  including the vitoss foam product platform 
in march  the initial term of the agreement was extended by amendment for an additional three years to vitagel and cellpaker will be manufactured by us following fda approval 
vitoss bone graft substitute  as well as any other products that we manufacture or distribute following their approval or clearance by the fda  including vitagel if we are approved as a manufacturer  will be subject to extensive regulation by the fda 
if safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market  the fda may impose severe limitations on the use of the product 
moreover  modifications to the approved or cleared product may require the submission of a new k notification or premarket approval application or premarket application supplement 
we may not be successful in obtaining approval to market the modified product in a timely manner  if at all 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
european union and other international markets general 
international sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are sold 
accordingly  the introduction of our products in markets outside the united states will be subject to regulatory approvals or clearances in those jurisdictions 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging and labeling requirements and import restrictions on medical devices 
in addition  each country has its own tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the approval or clearance by foreign government authorities is uncertain and can be expensive 
our ability to market our products could be substantially limited due to delays in receipt of  or failure to receive  the necessary approvals or clearances 
requirement of ce certification in the european union 
to market a product in the european union  we must be entitled to affix a ce certification  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
a ce certification enables us to market a product in all of the countries of the european union  as well as in other countries  such as switzerland and israel  that have adopted the european union s regulatory standards 
to date  we have received a ce certification for the use of vitoss bone graft substitute as a bone void filler and for the use of cortoss in screw augmentation and vertebral augmentation procedures 
there can be no assurance that we will receive ce certifications for cortoss for any other indications for use or that we will receive ce certifications for other products 
if we do not manage commercial scale manufacturing capability and capacity for our products in compliance with regulatory requirements and in a cost effective manner  our product sales may suffer 
our vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss synthetic cortical bone manufacturing facilities produce commercial products and are currently certified as meeting the requirements of iso for the period march  through march  and european norm for the period july  through july   and are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
in addition to the need for regulatory approval in the us for cortoss  in order to commercialize cortoss in the us  its manufacturing facility and quality assurance system must first pass inspection by the fda 
on november   we submitted a duplicate pma for vitagel to the fda through a grant of license from angiotech to reference their pma 
fda approval of the pma submitted by us  if obtained  will allow us to sell vitagel product that is manufactured on site in our malvern  pennsylvania facility 
as of december   we had included in inventory vitagel valued at  that was manufactured on site at our malvern facility 
we have no 
table of contents assurance that we will obtain fda approval to sell vitagel manufactured by us prior to our current supply of vitagel being exhausted 
we may not have sufficient inventory of vitagel during the second half of to support customer demand 
our product sales depend upon  among other things  our ability to manufacture our products in commercial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements and in a cost effective manner 
the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by the fda and other regulatory bodies for compliance with quality standards 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will not  during the course of an inspection of existing or new facilities  identify what they consider to be deficiencies in meeting the applicable standards and request or seek remedial action 
failure to comply with such regulations or a delay in attaining compliance may result in warning letters  injunctions suspending our manufacture of products  civil and criminal penalties  refusal to grant premarket approvals or clearances  ce certifications or clearances to products that are subject to future or pending submissions  product recalls or seizures of products  and total or partial suspensions of production 
we are dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
our ability to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss and to have vitoss foam and vitagel manufactured for us is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with royalty trust 
although we believe that we maintain good relationships with our suppliers  there can be no guarantee that such supplies and services will continue to be available with respect to our current and future commercialized products 
we are dependent on kensey and other third party manufacturers for the supply of products that we may sell 
the manufacture of our products is subject to regulation and periodic inspection by various regulatory bodies for compliance with current fda quality system regulation and requirements  and eu mdd international organization for standardization iso series standards and equivalent requirements 
our  square foot vitoss bone graft substitute and cortoss manufacturing facilities which produce our commercial products  are leased through july and are certified as meeting the requirements of iso for the period march  through march   and european norm en for the period july  through july  these facilities are subject to inspection by the fda for compliance with fda device manufacture requirements 
the most recent fda inspection resulted with no corrective actions being required 

table of contents we believe our manufacturing facilities have the capacity to meet our commercial needs for the next several years 
we are manufacturing vitagel  cellpaker  imbibe  endoskeleton ta  and aliquot through outside third party contract manufacturers 
our vitoss bone graft substitute is converted to vitoss foam by kensey  our development partner 
our third party manufacturers are iso certified or otherwise meet our quality system requirements 
in addition to the need for cortoss us regulatory approval in order to commercialize cortoss in the us  the cortoss manufacturing facility and quality assurance system must pass inspection by the fda 
angiotech decided to cease to manufacture vitagel by november  therefore  in october  we purchased all available existing products  accessories and work in process from angiotech for  which is expected to be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through mid additionally  on november   we submitted a duplicate pma for vitagel to the fda through a grant of license from angiotech to reference their pma 
fda approval of the pma submitted by us  if obtained  will allow us to sell vitagel product that is manufactured on site in our malvern  pennsylvania facility 
as of december   we had included in inventory vitagel valued at  that was manufactured on site at our malvern facility 
we have no assurance that we will obtain fda approval to sell vitagel manufactured by us prior to our current supply of vitagel being exhausted 
we may not have sufficient inventory of vitagel during the second half of to support customer demand 
our ability to manufacture our products is dependent on a limited number of specialty suppliers of certain raw materials 
we have a long term supply agreement which provides bovine collagen for the manufacture of vitagel  however  we do not have any other long term supply agreements for raw materials 
the failure of a supplier to continue to provide us with these materials at a price or quality acceptable to us  or at all  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture these products 
moreover  our failure to continue to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single sourced material used to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with royalty trust

the difficulties of operating in international markets may harm sales of our products 
the international nature of our business subjects us and our representatives  agents and distributors to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they operate  and in which our products are sold 
the types of risks that we face in international operations include the imposition of governmental controls  
table of contents logistical difficulties in managing international operations  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales and operations may be limited or disrupted if we cannot successfully meet the challenges of operating internationally 
if losses continue in the long term  it could limit our growth in the orthopedic industry and jeopardize our viability 
we have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and have funded our operations primarily from proceeds received from sales of our stock 
in july  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock to angiotech and  in december  we raised an aggregate of approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock to institutional investors 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  and investments of  as of december  will be sufficient to meet our currently estimated operating and investing requirements for at least the next twelve months 
to date  we have not been profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and at december   had an accumulated deficit of  these losses have resulted principally from the development and patenting of our technologies  pre clinical and clinical studies  preparation of submissions to the fda and foreign regulatory bodies  and the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses in the future as we continue our product development efforts  expand our marketing and sales activities and further develop our manufacturing capabilities 
we may not ever successfully commercialize our products in development 
we may never be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future and our products may never be commercially accepted or generate sufficient product sales to fund operations 
if we fail to meet our obligations under a revenue sharing agreement  we may be required to repurchase from an investor its right to receive revenues on certain of our product sales  and the investor could foreclose on certain assets that are essential to our operations 
during october  we completed a  product development and equity financing with paul capital royalty acquisition fund  lp  which was subsequently assigned to royalty trust 
in this financing  we sold royalty trust a revenue interest and shares of our common stock 
the revenue interest provides for royalty trust to receive on the first  of annual sales plus of annual sales in excess of  of certain of our products  including vitoss  cortoss and any structural bioactive device developed  in north america and europe through  subject to certain adjustments 
this revenue interest percentage can increase if we fail to meet contractually specified levels of annual net sales of products for which royalty trust is entitled to receive its revenue interest 
we do not currently expect that changes in the revenue interest percentage resulting from fluctuations in sales of products subject to the revenue interest will have a material effect on operating results for a period when considered relative to sales of the products for that period 
throughout the term of the royalty trust revenue interest agreement  we are required to make advance payments on the revenue interest obligation at the beginning of each year 
in january  the revenue interest assignment agreement with royalty trust was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  of the  paid to royalty trust   was earned in and the balance of  was included in prepaid revenue interest expense on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   and was repaid to us during the first quarter of in 
table of contents february  the revenue interest assignment agreement with royalty trust was amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  of the  paid to royalty trust   was earned in and the balance of  was included in prepaid revenue interest expense on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   and is scheduled to be repaid to us in april of in december  the revenue interest assignment agreement with royalty trust was again amended by mutual agreement to reduce the advance payment for from  to  which was paid to royalty trust during january the amount of the advance payment remains  in each of the years through while we believe that we will have sufficient cash at the end of to make the required  advance payments to royalty trust during  we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient cash to meet our advance payment obligations for the years through advance payments impact cash flow when made  and they affect earnings only as the advance payments are credited within each period against the revenue interest actually earned by royalty trust during that year  with any excess advance payments refunded to us shortly after the end of the year 
our obligation to pay the revenue interest is secured by our licenses  patents and trademarks relating to certain of our products  including vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and any structural bioactive device developed  in north america and europe  and the revenue interest we pay to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  on the sales of our products collectively  the pledged assets 
we are also required to maintain cash  cash equivalent and investment balances equal to or greater than the product of i and ii total operating losses  net of non cash charges  for the preceding fiscal quarter  and total shareholders equity of at least  provided  however  that under the provisions of the agreement with royalty trust  when calculating shareholders equity for the purposes of the financial covenants  the revenue interest obligation is included in shareholders equity at its carrying value 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
however  if we fail to maintain such balances and shareholders equity  royalty trust can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 
in addition to the failure to comply with the financial covenants described above  the occurrence of certain events  including those set forth below  triggers royalty trust s right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest a judicial decision that has a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  the acceleration of our obligations or the exercise of default remedies by a secured lender under certain debt instruments  a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy that involves us or our wholly owned subsidiary  vita special purpose corp  our insolvency  a change in control of our company  and the breach of a representation  warranty or certification made by us in the agreements with royalty trust that  individually or in the aggregate  would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  assets or financial condition  and such breach is not cured within days after notice thereof from royalty trust 
in addition  our failure to maintain strategic reserve supplies of each significant single source material used to manufacture vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and certain products that we may develop in the future may result in a breach of our material financing agreement with royalty trust 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event 
the exact amount of the repurchase price is dependent upon certain factors  including when the repurchase event occurs 
if a repurchase event had been 
table of contents triggered and royalty trust exercised its right to require us to repurchase its revenue interest as of december   we would have owed royalty trust  the repurchase price for royalty trust s revenue interest as of a given date is calculated in three steps 
first  a specified annual rate of return effective october  is applied to royalty trust s  original purchase price from october  to the date of determination of the repurchase price 
second  the result obtained from the first step of the calculation is added to the original  purchase price 
third  the sum obtained from the second step of the calculation is reduced by both  and the actual amount of revenue interest paid during the specified period 
if we were unable to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event  royalty trust could foreclose on the pledged assets  and we could be forced into bankruptcy 
royalty trust could also foreclose on the pledged assets if we became insolvent or involved in a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding 
no repurchase events or foreclosures have occurred as of december  in the event that we repurchased royalty trust s revenue interest  royalty trust would have no obligation to surrender the shares of our common stock that it had purchased as part of the revenue interests assignment transaction 
our results of operations may fluctuate due to factors out of our control  which could cause volatility in our stock price 
vitoss bone graft substitute  imbibe  cortoss and aliquot are currently our only products for which we have received regulatory approvals for sale 
vitoss bone graft substitute is cleared for sale in the us and the european union 
imbibe is cleared for sale in the us cortoss and aliquot are cleared for sale in the european union 
in addition  we obtained distribution rights to vitagel and cellpaker in june and launched that product in the us in january future levels of vitoss bone graft substitute  vitagel  cortoss  aliquot  cellpaker and imbibe product sales are difficult to predict 
vitoss bone graft substitute product sales to date may not be indicative of future sales levels 
vitoss bone graft substitute  cortoss and aliquot sales levels in europe may fluctuate due to seasonality of elective surgeries and the timing of any distributor stocking orders and vitoss bone graft substitute  vitagel  imbibe and cellpaker sales levels may fluctuate in the us due to seasonality of elective surgeries and the timing of orders from hospitals 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a number of additional factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the timing of governmental approvals or clearances for our products and our competitors products  unanticipated events associated with clinical and pre clinical trials of our products  the medical community s acceptance of our products  the timing in obtaining adequate third party reimbursement of our products  the success of competitive products  our ability to enter into strategic alliances with other companies  expenses associated with development and protection of intellectual property matters  establishment of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities  events affecting logistics and elective surgery trends  the timing of expenses related to commercialization of new products  competitive disruptions to our distribution channels  the adequate training of a sufficient number of surgeons in the use of our products  pending or threatened offers to acquire us  and timing of governmental approvals or clearances for us to manufacture the products we sell 
the results of our operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may not meet expectations of securities analysts and investors 
this may cause our stock price to be volatile 

table of contents our business will be damaged if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to our products  and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by others 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these measures afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights 
for example  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by third parties 
as of december   we own or control eighteen issued us patents and thirteen pending patent applications in the us  and several counterparts of certain of these patents and pending patent applications worldwide  including canada  europe  mexico and japan 
there can be no assurance that patents will issue from any of the pending patent applications 
moreover  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or we were the first to file patent applications for the relevant inventions for the following reasons patent applications filed prior to december in the us are maintained in secrecy until issued  patent applications filed after november in the us are maintained in secrecy until eighteen months from the date of filing  and the publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries 
if we do receive a patent  it may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary position in the technology or to be commercially useful to us 
in addition  if we lose any key personnel  we may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by those former employees 
furthermore  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us finally  even if our intellectual property rights are adequately protected  litigation or other proceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  which could result in substantial costs to us and result in a diversion of management attention 
if our intellectual property is not adequately protected  our competitors could use the intellectual property that we have developed to enhance their products and compete more directly with us  which could damage our business 
in addition to the risk of failing to adequately protect our proprietary rights  there is a risk that we may become subject to a claim that we infringe upon the proprietary rights of others 
although we do not believe that we are infringing the rights of others  third parties may claim that we are doing so 
there is a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry generally  and in the spinal market segments particularly 
if the holder of patents brought an infringement action against us  the cost of litigating the claim could be substantial and divert management attention 
in addition  if a court determined that one of our products infringed a patent  we could be prevented from selling that product unless we could obtain a license from the owner of the patent 
a license may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
modification of our products or development of new products to avoid infringement may require us to conduct additional clinical trials for these new or modified products and to revise our filings with the fda  which is time consuming and expensive 
if we were not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our product  our business could suffer 
if we cannot keep up with technological changes and marketing initiatives of competitors  sales of our products may be harmed 
extensive research efforts and rapid technological change characterize the market for products in the orthopedic market 
we anticipate that we will face intense competition from medical device  medical products and pharmaceutical companies 
for instance  several pmma bone cement received k clearance in for vertebral augmentation of vcfs 
further  in  the spinal bone grafting market saw the introduction of total 
table of contents disk replacement devices tdrs as treatment alternative for degenerative disk disease designed to preserve the motion of the vertebrae of the spine 
our products could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete by these and other competitors technological advances 
we may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products 
moreover  many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
these competitors may be in the process of seeking fda or other regulatory approvals or clearances  or patent protection  for competitive products 
our competitors could  therefore  commercialize competing products in advance of our products 
they may also enjoy substantial advantages over us in terms of research and development expertise  experience in conducting clinical trials  experience in regulatory matters  manufacturing efficiency  name recognition  sales and marketing expertise  established distribution channels  and established relationships with health care providers and payors 
these advantages may adversely affect our plans for market acceptance of our products 
we may acquire technologies or companies in the future  and these acquisitions could result in dilution to our shareholders and disruption of our business 
entering into an acquisition could divert management attention 
we also could fail to assimilate the acquired company  which could lead to higher operating expenses 
finally  our shareholders could be diluted if we issue shares of our stock to acquire another company or technology 

table of contents provisions of pennsylvania law or our articles of incorporation may deter a third party from seeking to obtain control of us or may affect your rights as a shareholder 
certain provisions of pennsylvania law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire us 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable and inventories 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  which have been reviewed with the audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is not recognized until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in the us  product sales revenue is recognized upon either receipt of documentation from the customer indicating their consumption of product from consigned inventory or shipment of purchased product to the customer 
outside the us  revenue from product sales is primarily recognized upon receipt of our product by our independent stocking distributors 
we do not allow product returns or exchanges 
we have no post shipment obligations to our customers 
both our us customers and our independent stocking distributor customers outside of the us are generally required to pay on a net day basis and sales discounts are not offered 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an accounts receivable allowance for an estimated amount of losses that may result from a customer s failure to pay for product purchased 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts

 sales of future revenues eitf 
on march   we amended the original financing  which resulted in a one time increase to the revenue interest obligation of  increasing the balance of the revenue interest obligation to  as of december  and the products that are subject to the revenue interest have only been approved or cleared and marketed for several years or are still under development 
for these reasons  as of december  and for the foreseeable future  we cannot currently make a reasonable estimate of future revenues and payments that may become due to royalty trust under this financing 
therefore  it is premature to estimate the expected impact of this financing on our results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
accordingly  given these uncertainties  we have charged and  for the foreseeable future  we will continue to charge revenue interest expense for the revenue interest due to royalty trust as revenues subject to the revenue interest obligation are recognized 
revenue interest expense of   and  has been recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the revenue interest under this agreement is treated as interest expense in accordance with eitf  sales of future revenues 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with an asset and liability approach requiring the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded without consideration as to their ability to be realized 
the deferred tax asset includes net operating loss carry forwards  and the cumulative temporary differences related to certain research and patent costs  which have been charged to expense in our consolidated statements of operations but have been recorded as assets for tax return purposes 
these tax assets are amortized over periods generally ranging from to years for tax purposes

under sfas no 
r  we will be required to expense stock options in our consolidated statements of operations when they are granted 
the actual effect on net loss and loss per share will vary depending upon the number of grants of options in and future periods as compared to prior years 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model  on a modified prospective transition method  as the most appropriate fair value method for our awards and will recognize compensation costs over the vesting periods of the awards

the company s board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting for all out of the money unvested stock options held by current employees  officers or directors on november  under the company s stock option plan and amended and restated equity compensation plan 
an option was considered out of the money if the stated exercise price was greater than per share  the closing sale price of the company s common stock on november  as a result of this action  options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock were subject to this acceleration 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that might be recorded in future periods following our adoption of sfas no

there may be future quarterly fluctuations in spending 
prior to the launch of each new product line configuration  significant inventory levels must be manufactured 
the inventory may be manufactured in anticipation of the receipt of regulatory approval or clearance and may be initially built with one year shelf life  so as to accelerate the commercial launch of the product  once approved or cleared  to our field sales network of independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives

however  if we fail to maintain certain specified balances and shareholders equity  royalty trust can demand that we repurchase its revenue interest 
we may not have sufficient cash funds to repurchase the revenue interest upon a repurchase event
