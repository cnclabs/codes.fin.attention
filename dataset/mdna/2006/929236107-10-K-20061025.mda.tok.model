the company continues to face significant competition and challenges within the household products categories 
however  we were encouraged by the performance of our household products during the current fiscal year 
for fiscal year  sales of us household products were up versus the prior fiscal year as a result of increases in distribution  increases in promotions and new products introduced throughout fiscal year the rising cost of products sold negatively affected gross margins during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we continue to be concerned about rising costs of components and raw materials 
we began to incur increased costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and have continued to see further cost increases 
to combat these cost increases  the company implemented price increases on certain products during the third quarter of fiscal year since that time  the company has continued to experience increases in product costs 
as a result  the company implemented additional price increases on certain products during the third quarter of fiscal year we continue to be focused on and committed to innovation

gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales in fiscal year  compared to million  or of sales in fiscal year the decrease in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the increase in cost of products sold 
the increase in cost of products negatively affected gross margins in all of the company s regions 
this increase was primarily due to the significant rise in costs for components and raw materials  including aerosol cans and petroleum based products 
as a result of the general upward trend of costs in the market  we are concerned about the possibility of continued rising costs of components  raw materials and finished goods 
gross margin percentage was also negatively impacted during the current fiscal year as the company incurred costs associated with impaired  slow moving and reworked inventory 
as a result  the company focused on reducing excess inventory of certain products and offered significant discounts  which reduced the gross margin percentage 
the discounts and costs associated with the impaired  slow moving and reworked inventory negatively impacted the gross margin percentage by in fiscal year the increase in cost of products sold and the costs associated with impaired  slow moving and reworked inventory were partially offset by a decrease in advertising and promotional discounts and other discounts  which positively impacted gross margin percentage by 
this decrease resulted from both timing and reductions in certain traditional advertising and promotional activities that have experienced declines in consumer response 
advertising and promotional discounts  which are recorded as a reduction to sales  include coupon redemptions  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in retailers stores and co operative advertising and promotional activity 
the timing of these promotional activities  as well as shifts in product mix  may cause fluctuations in gross margin percentage from period to period 
as the result of the continued trend of rising costs  the company has implemented price increases on certain products 
the company began to experience rising costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and has continued to experience further cost increases 
to reduce the impact of these cost increases  the company implemented price increases on certain products during the third quarter of fiscal year however  costs of components  raw materials and finished goods have continued to rise since last fiscal year s third quarter 
as a result  the company implemented additional price increases during the third quarter of fiscal year the increase in pricing of certain products worldwide added approximately to gross margin percentage in fiscal year compared to fiscal year although the price increases helped reduce the current effect of rising costs on gross margin percentage  further rises in the cost of products could offset the benefits of the price increases 
the company is also examining supply chain cost savings initiatives in an effort to further reduce the impact of increased costs on gross margin percentage 
additionally  the company believes that innovation will be a key factor in improving gross margin percentage in the long term 
note that the company s gross margins may not be comparable to those of other reporting entities  since some entities include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for distribution to our customers from our contract packagers  and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal year increased to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sg a was largely attributable to increases in bonus expense  employee related costs  stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement  research and development costs  freight costs and professional services 
bonus expense increased million versus the prior fiscal year  as many regions did not achieve profit and other performance expectations in the prior fiscal year  which resulted in a lower prior fiscal year bonus expense 
employee related costs  which include salaries  profit sharing and other fringe benefits  increased million versus the prior fiscal year as a result of annual compensation increases and additional staffing 
beginning in fiscal year  the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the expensing of stock options 
the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement resulted in a million incremental increase in compensation expense during fiscal year research and development costs increased million due to increased new product development activity 
freight costs increased million due to sales growth and increased fuel surcharges 
the million increase in professional services costs related to information technology  marketing  legal and tax related consulting 
also contributing to the increase in sg a was million of increased miscellaneous expenses such as depreciation and amortization  overhead expenses  insurance expenses  travel expenses and meeting expenses 
these increases were partially offset by million of decreased bad debt expense primarily related to recoveries of bad debt  including a preference claim  million of decreased sales commissions and million of decreased investor relations costs  as well as million of foreign currency translation impact

in fiscal year  the company began to increase marketing investment in the second quarter and continued during the remainder of the fiscal year  as the company aligned its advertising and sales promotion activities with the distribution of its current and new products 
as a percentage of sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities employed by the company  as the costs of certain promotional activities are required to be recorded as reductions to sales  and others remain in advertising and sales promotion expenses 
in fiscal year  the total promotional costs recorded as reductions to sales were million versus million in fiscal year therefore  the company s total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled million in fiscal year versus million in fiscal year amortization of intangible asset expense amortization of intangible asset expense was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year the amortization relates to the non contractual customer relationships intangible asset acquired in the acquisition  which was completed in april this intangible asset is being amortized over its estimated eight year life

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes for fiscal  a decrease from in fiscal year the decrease in tax rate is due to the benefits of irc section related to qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  as well as foreign tax credits and the tax benefit of municipal bond interest 
these tax benefits were partially offset by the impact of reduced low income housing credits  the growth of worldwide income and non deductible stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to some non us taxpayers 
net income net income was million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis for the fiscal year ended august   compared to million  or per common share for the prior fiscal year

the increase in lubricant sales in the americas during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year was the result of wd sales growth in canada and latin america as sales increased by and  respectively 
growth in canada was due to the launch of the wd smart straw and the wd no mess pen 
the wd smart straw and the wd no mess pen were introduced in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  respectively

spot shot sales increased in the us during the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year due to increased promotional activities with key customers and sales from new products  spot shot pro and spot shot with a trigger format 
additionally  during most of the prior fiscal year  spot shot experienced decreased sales as a result of a key us customer temporarily replacing spot shot with competitor products as it performed competitor sales testing 
although spot shot was successful and maintained distribution  these tests caused sales to be lower in the prior fiscal year 
overall  spot shot continues to outperform new entrants as well as established products on the shelf 
the company has committed research and development resources to create meaningful innovation for the spot shot brand  including spot shot pro and spot shot with a trigger format 
spot shot pro is an aerosol carpet stain remover targeted to frequent and commercial users  and the new spot shot product with a trigger delivery format is a liquid carpet stain remover 
both of these new products also provide innovation through an odor neutralizing formula 
over the past two years  retailers have reduced shelf space for traditional rug and room deodorizers for reallocation to other air care products 
as a result  the rug and room deodorizer category as a whole has declined in the mass retail and grocery trade channels

us sales of flushes x automatic toilet bowl cleaners were up in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due to increased promotional activities performed by the company  as well as promotional activities performed by a key customer 
however  sales of the automatic toilet bowl cleaning category are being pressured overall due to competition from the manual bowl cleaning category 
to address the challenges and opportunities that exist within the competitive environments of the household products categories  the company continues to focus on innovation through product  packaging and promotional strategies 
sales of heavy duty hand cleaners for the americas decreased in fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
although sales of heavy duty hand cleaners decreased slightly  distribution remains consistent through the grocery trade and other classes of trade

valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the potential impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for goodwill and intangibles determined to have indefinite lives  impairment is tested at least annually under the guidance of sfas no 
 during our second fiscal quarter of each year unless there are indicators during an interim period that assets may have become impaired 
the company s impairment test is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment and estimates  such as forecasted revenue  advertising and promotional expenses  cost of products sold  gross margins  operating margins  the success of product innovations and introductions  customer retention and the selection of appropriate discount and royalty rates 
management judgments and estimates are based on assumptions that are most reasonably likely to occur 
for goodwill  impairment occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit 
for intangible assets  impairment occurs when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value 
in addition  intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated quarterly to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
events and circumstances that we consider important which could trigger impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period decreased market capitalization relative to net book value unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key distribution loss of key personnel acts by government and courts when there is indication that the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
when there is an indication of impairment of goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company tested its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment based on future discounted cash flows compared to related book values 
based on this review  the company determined that there were no instances of impairment
