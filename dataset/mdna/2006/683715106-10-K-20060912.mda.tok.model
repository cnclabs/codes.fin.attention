quarterly overview the following table summarizes selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the past eight fiscal quarters fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter in thousands total revenues gross profit net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter in thousands total revenues gross profit net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted quarterly revenues and expenses are impacted by a number of external factors including the timing of large transactions  timing of budget approvals of our customers  acquisitions  seasonality of economic activity and to some degree the timing of capital spend by our customers 
historically  our second quarter which coincides with the fourth quarter of a number of our customers has been our strongest quarter and we expect this trend to continue in fiscal 
table of contents results of operations the following table presents an overview of our selected financial data 
fiscal year change from fiscal year in thousands to to total revenue cost of revenue gross profit amortization of acquired intangible assets special charges recoveries    n a n a other operating expenses income from operations gross margin operating margin net income our focus in fiscal was on increasing near term profitability by streamlining our operations 
to achieve this we announced a significant restructuring of our operations in july which resulted in a charge of million 
this restructuring primarily included work force reductions and abandonment of excess real estate facilities 
absent the impact of this charge our operational income was million in fiscal which was a substantial improvement over our operational income absent the impact of a restructuring recovery in fiscal  which was million 
going forward we expect to generate annualized savings of approximately to million as a result of this restructuring initiative 
in addition  we rationalized our product portfolio and made significant progress with our global partner program  particularly with microsoft  oracle and sap 
we received microsoft s global isv independent software vendor of the year award and launched a program with oracle which will include the joint selling of oracle and open text products 
this reinforces our belief that our global partner program is strong and we expect this momentum to continue in fiscal we are positive on the overall outlook for ecm in fiscal our objective in fiscal is to increase our market share and we expect our level of partner sales to increase to or more from our current level of approximately 
we will continue to adapt to market changes in the ecm sector by developing new solutions  leveraging our existing solutions and utilizing our partner programs to reach new customers  and to serve existing customers more effectively 
we also expect to announce the formal release of livelink ecm version  our next major product release  within the first six months of fiscal livelink is a higher value added application that will offer the ability to connect with or interact with various platforms from other vendors 
finally  we expect contingent upon the successful closure of the hummingbird acquisition to focus our efforts on the operational integration of hummingbird into our operations and to realize the synergies in our combined product offerings 
an analysis of each of the components of our results of operations follows revenues revenue by product type the following tables set forth our revenues by product and as a percentage of the related product revenue for the periods indicated in thousands change in change in license customer support services total 
table of contents of total revenue license customer support services total license revenue license revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing of software products to customers 
license revenue decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the drop was primarily due to structural re alignment of certain sales forces around the world  which decreased license revenue by approximately million  as we continued to focus on streamlining our operations and to focus on future profitability 
this decrease was offset by improved results in north america  where license revenue increased by approximately million compared with fiscal we believe the increased license revenue in north america was the result of a greater demand in north america for our ecm and sap solutions 
the remaining decrease in license revenue is attributable to a negative foreign exchange impact of million 
license revenue increased in fiscal  compared to fiscal  by million 
we generated approximately million in revenue from acquisitions and approximately million related to the positive impact of foreign exchange rates 
this increase was offset by the discontinuance of unprofitable revenue streams obtained through acquisitions 
in addition  fiscal revenue was negatively impacted by a shift in our business model that saw customers increasingly interested in buying  substantially  a full ecm platform  which had the impact of lengthening the sales cycle and close process for new deals and deals in the pipeline 
further  sales were impacted due to our need to partially rebuild our north american sales force  during the year  to meet the needs of our evolving business model 
finally  the large drop in the euro during the fourth quarter had the effect of delaying purchase decisions with respect to several of our large european customers 
for these reasons  our organic growth decreased in fiscal customer support revenue customer support revenue consists of revenue from our customer support and maintenance agreements 
these agreements allow our customers to receive technical support  enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available 
customer support revenue is generated from such support and maintenance agreements relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
as our installed base grows  the renewal rate has a larger influence on customer support revenue than the current software revenue growth 
therefore changes in customer support revenue do not necessarily correlate directly to the changes in license revenue in a given period 
typically the term of these support and maintenance agreements is twelve months  with customer renewal options 
we have historically experienced a renewal rate over but continue to encounter pricing pressure from our customers during contract negotiation and renewal 
new license sales create additional customer support agreements which contribute substantially to the increase in our customer support revenue 
customer support revenue increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal all geographic regions contributed to the increase in customer support revenue from fiscal to fiscal north american customer support revenue rose by in fiscal european customer support revenue rose by in fiscal  and customer support revenue in other regions increased by in fiscal customer support revenues increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in customer support revenues resulted from several factors 
customer support revenues related to the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions accounted for approximately and  respectively  of 
table of contents the revenue growth 
the increase in the number of licenses granted in fiscal  which resulted in an increased number of maintenance contracts  contributed to the growth in customer support revenues in fiscal moreover  we continued to experience very strong service support contract renewal rates for all of our products  which also contributed to the growth in customer support revenue 
service revenue service revenue consists of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide training and integration services 
service revenue remained relatively stable in fiscal albeit dropping very slightly by million compared to fiscal service revenue was strong in north america  with revenues increasing by million from fiscal to fiscal the increase in north american service revenue was due in part to its close relationship to license revenue 
we believe this growth was the result of a strong market demand for our ecm solutions  namely our livelink platform  as well as our strategic shift in focus towards deployment solutions and services consulting 
this increase in service revenue for north america was offset by a decrease in fiscal service revenue of million in europe compared to fiscal approximately million of this decrease was the result of lower license revenue in europe 
the remaining decrease was primarily the result of the cancellation through negotiation of several over run legacy projects  and the cancellation of these projects forced us to lose short term revenue 
although these projects resulted in less revenue for fiscal  we believe the cancellation of these projects will avert unprofitable long term problems in the future 
service revenue from countries other than north america and europe resulted in a decrease of million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease of license revenue in fiscal overall  the foreign exchange impact on our service revenue was favorable by approximately  service revenues increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal service revenues related to fiscal acquisitions represented of the growth while fiscal acquisitions represented approximately of the growth 
in fiscal  we completed the integration of the fiscal acquisitions most notably ixos  aligning services with the sales verticals for consistent teaming on strategic accounts as well as delivering repeatable services solutions as opposed to trying to deliver unique consulting solutions to each customer  which resulted in the growth in these revenues 
revenue and operating margin by geography the following table sets forth information regarding our revenue by geography revenue by geography in thousands north america europe other total of total revenue north america europe other total 
table of contents the overall increase in north america revenues in fiscal versus fiscal and fiscal is reflective of our strengthened sales management  improved focus on sales process management  enhancement of lead generation processes and a focus on our key partnerships and verticals that represent our greatest opportunities 
decreases in european revenues reflect the weakening of european currencies and a structural re alignment of our european sales force 
north america the north america geographic segment includes canada  the united states and mexico 
revenues in north america increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is the result of the north american market showing greater interest in our ecm and sap solutions 
in fiscal  north america saw an increase of new customers  ranging from fortune companies  major government organizations and financial institutions 
europe the europe geographic segment includes austria  belgium  denmark  finland  france  germany  italy  netherlands  norway  spain  sweden  switzerland and the united kingdom 
revenues in europe decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease can be attributed to the structural realignment of certain sales forces in fiscal in fiscal  we focused on profitability which resulted in us having to give up growth in certain areas 
other the other geographic segment includes australia  japan  malaysia  and the middle east region 
revenues from our other segments decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the reorganization of our operating model in certain areas  such as the middle east 
by leveraging our partner programs in these areas  we can enhance our sales force coverage and expect to see increased cost effectiveness in the future 
adjusted operating margin by significant segment the following table provides a summary of the company s adjusted operating margins by significant segment 
north america europe our adjusted operating margins have increased in all geographies in fiscal compared to fiscal on account of our customers being increasingly interested in purchasing a complete ecm platform which generally involves a larger dollar value transaction 
this has the effect of lengthening lead times for new and existing opportunities 
the decrease in adjusted operating margins in europe in fiscal versus fiscal is due to the fact that fiscal included the results of ixos from march  this resulted in a higher adjusted operating margin from ixos than would have been realized on an annual basis due to the timing seasonality of revenue and expenses 
in addition  the rapid devaluation of the euro in late fiscal triggered deferrals of customer purchases late into the year 

table of contents the increase in margins in north america is due to a substantial realignment of our sales management efforts 
adjusted operating margin is a non gaap financial measure 
such non gaap financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus our definition may be different from similar non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
we use this financial measure to supplement the information provided in our consolidated financial statements  which are presented in accordance with us gaap 
the presentation of adjusted operating margin is not meant to be a substitute for net income presented in accordance with us gaap  but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such us gaap measures 
adjusted operating margin is calculated based on net income before including the impact of amortization of acquired intangibles  special charges  other income expense  share based compensation expenses and the provision for taxes 
these items are excluded based upon the manner in which our management evaluates our business 
we believe the provision of this non gaap measure allows our investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of our core business using the same evaluation measures that we use to make decisions 
as such we believe this non gaap measure is a useful indication of our performance or expected performance of recurring operations and may facilitate period to period comparisons of operating performance

amortization of acquired intangible assets increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is due to the impact of the fiscal acquisitions and a full year s amortization of the ixos intangible assets  versus four months amortization in the prior year 
because the amortization of acquired intangible assets is only included from the date of acquisition  this expense continued to increase substantially in fiscal when a full year amortization was recorded for the fiscal acquisitions 

table of contents special charges recoveries in fiscal  we recorded special charges of million 
this charge is primarily comprised of million  relating to the fiscal restructuring  million related to the impairment of capital assets  and million related to the impairment of intangible assets

fair value was determined based on our estimate of disposal proceeds  net of anticipated costs to sell 
impairment of intangible assets during fiscal  impairment charges of million were recorded relating to a write down of intellectual property in north america 
the intellectual property represents the fair value of acquired technology from the corechange acquisition which closed in the fiscal year 
the triggering event that gave rise to the impairment was a shift in the marketing and development strategy associated with this acquired technology and 
table of contents an assessment of where the technology is in terms of our assessment of the product lifecycle 
the impairment was measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the discounted projected future net cash flows 
income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal compared to million during fiscal and million in fiscal this equates to an effective tax rate of in fiscal versus an effective tax rate of and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal versus the two preceding fiscal years is in part due to the fact that the corresponding tax benefit has not been realized on losses that resulted from our fiscal restructuring charge 
our deferred tax assets totaling million are based upon available income tax losses and future income tax deductions 
our ability to use these income tax losses and future income tax deductions is dependent upon us generating income in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arose 
the recognized deferred tax liability of million is primarily made up of three components 
the first component relates to million arising from the amortization of timing differences relating to acquired intangible assets and future income inclusions 
the second component of million relates primarily to deferred credits arising from non capital losses and undeducted scientific research and development experimental expenditures acquired at a discount on asset acquisitions  which will be included in income as they are utilized 
the third component of million relates to deferred tax liability arising from investment tax credits 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
based on the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies  we have determined that a valuation allowance of million is required in respect of our deferred income tax assets as at june  a valuation allowance of million was required for the deferred income tax assets as at june  
this valuation allowance is primarily attributable to valuation allowances set up based on losses incurred in the year in certain foreign jurisdictions 
in order to fully utilize the recognized deferred income tax assets of million  we will need to generate aggregate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions of approximately million 
based on our current projection of taxable income for the periods in the jurisdictions in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the recognized deferred income tax assets as of june  liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the changes in our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows over the periods indicated in thousands june  june  change in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of an increase in non cash adjustments of approximately million and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was offset by a decrease in net income of approximately million 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the overall decrease in investing expenditures was primarily due to the fact that we did not make any business acquisitions in fiscal which represented approximately million in spending in fiscal and our acquisition related costs were lower by million 
in addition  we also spent million less in fiscal than fiscal purchasing ixos and gauss shares 
these savings in investment were offset by our increased capital spending of million  million on prior period acquisitions and an investment of million in the shares of hummingbird 
we currently own approximately of ixos 
based on current estimates we anticipate the additional cost of acquiring ixos shares to be approximately million 
net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by financing increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the fact that we did not repurchase any of our common shares in fiscal  which represented million in spending in fiscal and as a result of the mortgage financing we secured on our waterloo building  which represented approximately million in fiscal in fiscal we secured a demand operating facility of cdn million with a canadian chartered bank 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at varying rates depending upon the nature of the borrowing 
we have pledged certain of our assets as collateral for this demand operating facility 
there are no stand by fees for this facility 
as of june   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
we intend to finance the offer to purchase hummingbird shares through loan facilities that are currently being negotiated with a canadian chartered bank 
the loan facilities were not finalized as of the date of the filing of this annual report under form k 
the facilities will potentially include a term loan facility and a revolving facility 
we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  available credit facilities and committed loan facilities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  contractual commitments and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
commitments and contractual obligations we have entered into the following contractual obligations with minimum annual payments for the indicated fiscal periods as follows payments due by fiscal year ended june  total to and beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations net of million of non cancelable sublease income we are to receive from properties which we have subleased to other parties

ixos domination agreements based on the number of minority ixos shareholders as of june   the estimated amount of annual compensation payable to ixos minority shareholder was approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  because we are unable to predict  with reasonable accuracy  the number of ixos minority shareholders that will be on record in future periods  we are unable to predict the amount of annual compensation that will be payable in future years 
certain ixos shareholders have filed for a procedure granted under german law at the district court of munich  germany  asking the court to reassess the amount of the annual compensation and the purchase price for the amounts offered under the ixos da 
it cannot be predicted at this stage  whether the court will increase the annual compensation and or the purchase price 
the costs associated with the above mentioned procedure are direct incremental costs associated with the ongoing step acquisitions of shares held by the minority shareholders 
these disputes are a normal and probable part of the process of acquiring minority shares in germany 
we are unable to predict the future costs associated with these activities that will be payable in future periods 
for further details relating to the ixos domination agreement refer to note commitments and contingencies in our notes to consolidated financial statements under item to this annual report on form k 
gauss squeeze out we have recorded our best estimate of the amount payable to the minority shareholders of gauss under the squeeze out 
as of june   we had accrued  for such payments 
we are currently not able to determine the final amount payable and we are unable to predict the date on which the resolutions will be registered in the commercial register 
we continue to incur direct and incremental costs associated with the squeeze out procedures and registration thereof 
we are unable to predict the future costs associated with these activities that will be payable in future periods 
for further details relating to the gauss squeeze out refer to note commitments and contingencies in our notes to consolidated financial statements under item  to this annual report on form k 
litigation we are subject from time to time to legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty  our management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not enter into off balance sheet financing as a matter of practice except for the use of operating leases for office space  computer equipment  and vehicles 
in accordance with us gaap  neither the lease liability nor the underlying asset is carried on the balance sheet  as the terms of the leases do not meet the criteria for capitalization 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap necessarily requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed at the time to be reasonable under the circumstances 
under different assumptions or conditions  the actual results will differ  potentially materially  from those previously estimated 
many of the conditions impacting these assumptions and estimates are outside of our control 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements business combinations we account for acquisitions of companies in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets  intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition with the excess of purchase price  if any  being allocated to goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
we test long lived assets or asset groups  such as capital assets and definite lived intangible assets  for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group 
an impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds 
table of contents discounted projected future cash flows 
we recorded an impairment charge of million during the year ended june  see note special charges recoveries under item on this form k 
acquired intangibles this category consists of acquired technology and contractual relationships associated with various acquisitions  as well as trademarks and patents 
acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income producing capabilities of software products acquired on acquisitions 
acquired technology is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
contractual relationships represent relationships that we have with certain customers on contractual or legal rights and are considered separable 
we acquired these contractual relationships through business combinations and they were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
contractual relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
we continually evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
goodwill fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas  we do not amortize goodwill 
we performed  in accordance with sfas  our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of april  historically  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test coincident with our year end of june in fiscal  the date of the test was moved to the first day of the fourth quarter  in order to provide us with more adequate time to complete the analysis given the acceleration of public company reporting requirements 
we believe that the accounting change described above is an alternative accounting principle that is preferable under the circumstances and that the change was not intended to delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge 
the analysis in all years indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the reporting units 
if estimates change  a materially different impairment conclusion could result 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments 
we evaluate the credit worthiness of our customers prior to order fulfillment and based on these evaluations  adjust credit limits to the respective customers 
in addition to these evaluations  we conduct on going credit evaluations of our customers payment history and current credit worthiness 
the allowance is maintained for of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible and  for those receivables not specifically identified as uncollectible  an allowance is maintained for a specific percentage of those receivables based upon the aging of accounts  our historical collection experience and current economic expectations 
to date  the actual losses have been within management expectations 
no single customer accounted for more than of the accounts receivable balance as of june  and asset retirement obligations we account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which applies to certain obligations associated with the retirement 
table of contents of tangible long lived assets 
sfas requires that a liability be initially recognized for the estimated fair value of the obligation when it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset and the associated liability is accreted to the estimated fair value of the obligation at the settlement date through periodic accretion charges recorded within general and administrative expenses 
when the obligation is settled  any difference between the final cost and the recorded amount is recognized as income or loss on settlement 
revenue recognition a license revenues we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa in october as amended by sop issued in december we record product revenue from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue on delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element 
our multiple element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support pcs are sold together 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered pcs element based on the contracted price for renewal pcs included in the original multiple element sales arrangement  as substantiated by contractual terms and our significant pcs renewal experience  from our existing worldwide base 
our multiple element sales arrangements generally include rights for the customer to renew pcs after the bundled term ends 
these rights are irrevocable to the customer s benefit  are for specified prices and the customer is not subject to any economic or other penalty for failure to renew 
further  the renewal pcs options are for services comparable to the bundled pcs and cover similar terms 
it is our experience that customers generally exercise their renewal pcs option 
in the renewal transaction  pcs is sold on a stand alone basis to the licensees one year or more after the original multiple element sales arrangement 
the renewal pcs price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple element sales arrangement although an adjustment to reflect consumer price changes is not uncommon 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we assess whether payment terms are customary or extended in accordance with normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is occurring 
our sales arrangements generally include standard payment terms 
these terms effectively relate to all customers  products  and arrangements regardless of customer type  product mix or arrangement size 
the only time exceptions are made to these standard terms is on certain sales in parts of the world where local practice differs 
in these jurisdictions  our customary payment terms are in line with local practice 
b service revenues service revenues consist of revenues from consulting  implementation  training and integration services 
these services are set forth separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of these services 
for 
table of contents those contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of any other element of the transaction  we determine vsoe of fair value for these services based upon normal pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
these consulting and implementation services contracts are primarily time and materials based contracts that are  on average  less than six months in length 
revenue from these services is recognized at the time such services are rendered as the time is incurred by us 
we also enter into contracts that are primarily fixed fee arrangements to render specific consulting services 
the percentage of completion method is applied to these more complex contracts that involve the provision of services relating to the design or building of complex systems  because these services are essential to the functionality of other elements in the arrangement 
under this method  the percentage of completion is calculated based on actual hours incurred compared to the estimated total hours for the services under the arrangement 
for those fixed fee contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of a software element  the proportional performance method is applied to recognize revenue 
revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which these services are performed 
c customer support revenues customer support revenues consist of revenue derived from contracts to provide pcs to license holders 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
advance billings of pcs are not recorded to the extent that the term of the pcs has not commenced or payment has not been received 
research and development costs research and development costs internally incurred in creating computer software to be sold  licensed or otherwise marketed  are expensed as incurred unless they meet the criteria for deferral and amortization  described in fasb sfas no 
accounting for the costs of corporate software to be sold  released  or otherwise marketed sfas 
in accordance with sfas  costs related to research  design and development of products are charged to expenses as incurred and capitalized between the dates that the product is considered to be technologically feasible and is considered to be ready for general release to customers 
in our historical experience  the dates relating to the achievement of technological feasibility and general release of the product have substantially coincided 
in addition  no significant costs are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
as a result we do not capitalize any research and development costs relating to internally developed software to be sold  licensed or otherwise marketed 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
these temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that management considers it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the valuation allowance  management considers factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
in addition  we are subject to examinations by taxation authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the normal course of operations 
we regularly assess the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other taxes 

table of contents restructuring charges we record restructuring charges relating to contractual lease obligations and other exit costs in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires recognition of costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
we record restructuring charges relating to employee termination costs in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for post employment benefits sfas 
sfas applies to post employment benefits provided to employees under on going benefit arrangements 
in accordance with sfas  we record such charges when the termination benefits are capable of being determined or estimated in advance  from either the provisions of our policy or from past practices  the benefits are attributable to services already rendered and the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires management to make certain judgments regarding the nature  timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities  including estimating sublease income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the appropriateness of the remaining accrued balances 
litigation we are a party  from time to time  in legal proceedings 
in these cases  management assesses the likelihood that a loss will result  as well as the amount of such loss and the financial statements provide for our best estimate of such losses 
to the extent that any of these legal proceedings are resolved and the result is that we are required to pay an amount in excess of what has been provided for in the financial statements  we would be required to record  against earnings  such excess at that time 
if the resolution resulted in a gain to us  or a loss less than that provided for  such gain is recognized when received or receivable 
new accounting standards adoption of sfas r on july   we adopted the fair value based method for measurement and cost recognition of employee share based compensation under the provisions of fasb sfas r  using the modified prospective transitional method 
previously  we had been accounting for employee share based compensation using the intrinsic value method  which generally did not result in any compensation cost being recorded for stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
our stock options are now accounted for under sfas r 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
for the year ended june   the weighted average fair value of options granted  as of the grant date  was  using the following weighted average assumptions expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  and expected life of years 
for the year ended june   the weighted average fair value of options granted  as of the grant date  during the periods was  using the following weighted average assumptions expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  and expected life of years 
for the year ended june   the weighted average fair value of options granted  as of the grant date  during the periods was  using the following weighted average assumptions expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  and expected life of years 

table of contents share based compensation cost included in the statement of income for the year ended june  was approximately million 
additionally  deferred tax assets of  were recorded  as of june  in relation to the tax effect of certain stock options that are eligible for a tax deduction when exercised 
as of june  the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized is million which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
we made no modifications to the terms of our outstanding share options in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r 
also  we made no changes in either the quantity or type of instruments used in our share option plans or the terms of our share option plans 
additionally  effective july   we amended the terms of our employee share purchase plan espp to set the amount at which common shares may be purchased by employees to of the average market price on the toronto stock exchange tsx or the nasdaq on the last day of the purchase period 
as a result of the amendments  the espp is no longer considered a compensatory plan under the provisions of sfas r  and as a result no compensation cost is recorded related to the espp 
in order to calculate the fair value of share based payment awards  we use the black scholes model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility  the expected exercise behavior and forfeiture rate 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of options granted is based on historical experience and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option are determined by the us treasury yields and the government of canada benchmark bond yields for us dollar and canadian dollar options  respectively  in effect at the time of the grant 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change or we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
we are also required to estimate the forfeiture rate and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the period such determination is made

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign currency risk businesses generally conduct transactions in their local currency which is also known as their functional currency 
additionally  balances that are denominated in a currency other than the entity s reporting currency must be adjusted to reflect changes in foreign exchange rates during the reporting period 
as we operate internationally  a substantial portion of our business is also conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  our results are affected  and may be affected in the future  by exchange rate 
table of contents fluctuations of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  to various european currencies  and  to a lesser extent  other foreign currencies 
revenues and expenses generated in foreign currencies are translated at exchange rates during the month in which the transaction occurs 
we cannot predict the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future  however  if significant foreign exchange losses are experienced  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
moreover  in any given quarter  exchange rates can impact revenue adversely 
we have net monetary asset and liability balances in foreign currencies other than the us dollar  including primarily the euro eur  the pound sterling gbp  the canadian dollar cdn  and the swiss franc chf 
our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in us dollars 
we do not currently use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in foreign currencies 
the following tables provide a sensitivity analysis on our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
for foreign currencies where we engage in material transactions  the following table quantifies the absolute impact that a increase decrease against the us dollar would have had on our total revenues  operating expenses  and net income for the year ended june  this analysis is presented in both functional and transactional currency 
functional currency represents the currency of measurement for each of an entity s domestic and foreign operations 
transactional currency represents the currency in which the underlying transactions take place
