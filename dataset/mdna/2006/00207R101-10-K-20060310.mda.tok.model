item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing in item of this annual report 
overview atmi believes it is a leading supplier of materials  materials delivery systems and high purity materials packaging and dispensing products used worldwide in the manufacture of microelectronic devices 
atmi specifically targets semiconductor manufacturers  whose silicon chips form the foundation of microelectronics technology proliferating through information technology  automotive  communication and consumer products industries 
the market for semiconductor chips or devices is growing and continually changing  which drives demand for new products and technologies at lower cost 
atmi s objective is to meet the demands of semiconductor and other microelectronic manufacturers with solutions that maximize the efficiency of their manufacturing processes and minimize the time to ramp new processes and deliver new products 
atmi s customers include many of the leading semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers in the world  targeting leading edge technologies in semiconductor manufacturing 
during  atmi significantly reduced its exposure to the capital equipment cycles of the semiconductor industry by selling non core product lines 
the non core product lines that we exited by sale included the following environmental abatement equipment  materials sensing and monitoring equipment  specialty thin film deposition services  outsourced parts cleaning and tool maintenance services  our smartcard device venture and gallium nitride materials 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional details about the discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of atmi s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have determined that our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  inventories  marketable securities and investments  depreciation and amortization  goodwill  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon delivery to a common carrier when terms are fob origin and upon receipt by a customer when terms are fob destination 
in instances where final acceptance of equipment is specified by the purchase agreement  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been satisfied 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we accrue for sales returns  warranty costs and other allowances based on a current evaluation of our experience based on stated terms of the transactions 
should actual product failure rates or customer return experience differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated accruals would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established to represent our best estimate of the net realizable value of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors surrounding the credit risk of the specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends  we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and ongoing account balance reviews and agings of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within the time frame of the credit terms extended 
write offs are charged directly against the allowance for doubtful accounts and occur only after all collection efforts have been exhausted 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates due to unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks surrounding specific customers 
inventories we value inventories using the first in  first out fifo cost method 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and we write down the value of inventories for estimated obsolescence and excess quantities on hand and for known adverse conditions and circumstances 
each quarter  we make estimates of future demand by using the latest forecasts and known market conditions available to us 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
marketable securities we account for marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities as amended by fasb staff position fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  fsp 
fsp provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of other than temporary impairment losses and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
all of the company s marketable securities are classified as available for sale as of the balance sheet date and are reported at fair value  based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
marketable securities that are in a temporarily impaired position  where management has the ability and intent to hold until anticipated recovery or maturity  are classified as either current or non current based on the remaining contractual maturity of the security 
those securities in a temporarily impaired position with contractual maturities greater than one year are classified as non current 
cost basis investments we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within or related to our strategic focus  which are in private companies whose value is difficult to determine 
investments in private companies are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other long term assets 
we review investments in private companies for impairment based upon the financial health and specific prospects for the issuer 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate our property  plant and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
the depreciation periods used are as follows buildings  to years  machinery and equipment  to years  furniture and fixtures  years  and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life 
we amortize our patents and other amortizable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
all amortizable intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  ranging from to years 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   the company had million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units  as defined by sfas no 
management completed this annual assessment during the fourth quarter of based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporated management s assumptions about expected future cash flows 
based on this assessment  there is no goodwill impairment as of december  future cash flows can be affected by changes in the global economy and local economies  changes in the semiconductor industry  changes in technology  and the execution of management s plans 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairment of goodwill 
we review the carrying values of intangible assets and long lived assets for impairment when facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets or other assets may be impaired 
an impairment review consists of a specific evaluation of the assets or groups of assets to determine whether any impairment exists  by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount 
if the review indicates that the asset is impaired  then an impairment loss representing the difference between the asset s fair value and its carrying value is recognized 
stock based compensation we currently account for our stock based awards under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations 
all options granted under our plans had exercise prices equal to market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
all stock based compensation expense included in the statements of operations is calculated using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb no 
unvested restricted share grants awarded to employees are included in earnings as an expense over the vesting period of the award 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date or later modification 
in addition  sfas no 
r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining requisite service period 
we have elected to adopt sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective approach 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of sfas no 
r 
income taxes we estimate and use our expected annual effective income tax rate to accrue income taxes on an interim basis 
we update these estimates quarterly 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred income tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we determine that we will not realize all or part of our deferred income tax assets in the future  we will make an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred income tax assets  which would be reflected as an income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will realize a deferred income tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we will reverse the valuation allowance  which would be reflected as an income tax benefit in our financial statements 
we take tax positions in our worldwide corporate income tax filings based on careful interpretations of local statutes  rules  regulations and court decisions 
taxing jurisdictions may or may not challenge our application and interpretation of various tax laws 
however  we do not anticipate that any sustained challenge by any taxing jurisdiction will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or net income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities included money market securities  corporate and municipal bond obligations and commercial paper 
as of december   an increase of basis points in interest rates would reduce the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of bais points in interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and as a result  the company has relatively minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
approximately of the company s sales are denominated in japanese yen jpy  but the product is sourced in us dollars 
management periodically reviews the company s exposure to currency fluctuations 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company currently utilizes forward exchange contracts to hedge certain jpy exposures  but does not use any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   atmi had million notional amount of foreign exchange contracts  which are being used to hedge recorded foreign denominated assets in jpy 
holding other variables constant  if there were a adverse change in foreign exchange rates for the jpy  the fair market value of the contracts outstanding at december  would decrease by approximately million 
the effect of an immediate change in other foreign exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows 
changes in market risk there have been no material quantitative changes in market risk exposure between the fiscal years ended december  and december
