item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an asp that provides edc and other services to companies in the clinical pharmaceutical  biotechnology  cro and medical device research industries 
we assist our customers in accelerating the completion of clinical trials by streamlining the collection of data relating to clinical trials  and improving the overall quality of the clinical trial data collected 
the discussion that follows highlights our business conditions and certain financial information 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
approximately of our assets  or  is held in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
during and  we recorded operating income for the first time since commencing edc operations in we are continuing to develop and commercialize our business  and anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we use a technology platform that consists of windows compatible software and internet hardware to provide edc and other services to clinical trial sponsors and cros 
our future success is dependent on market acceptance of edc in general  as an alternative to the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  and acceptance of our datrak edc and datatrak eclinical software products specifically 
at december   our backlog was  compared to backlog of  at december  our december  backlog consisted of contracts with an average remaining value of  at december   our backlog consisted of contracts with an average remaining value of  our contracts in backlog at december  generated  of revenue during if we have no delays or cancellations to the contracts in backlog at december   we expect to convert approximately  of our december  backlog into revenue during our contracts can be cancelled or delayed at anytime and  therefore  our backlog  at any point in time  is not an accurate predictor of future levels of revenue 
as a result of our transactional and service based business model combined with the dynamic nature of the clinical trials market where changes in scope are common  backlog has historically been an imprecise predictor of short term revenue 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies were identified to be those related to revenue recognition  software development costs and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition our contracts provide a fixed price for each component or service to be delivered  and revenue is recognized as these components or services are delivered 
we recognize revenue based on the performance or delivery of the following specified services or components of our edc contracts in the manner described below project management and data management design  report and export services are recorded as revenue proportionally over the life of a contract as services are performed  based on the contractual billing rate per hour for those services 
data items revenue is earned based on a price per data unit as data items are entered into our hosting facility 
classroom training services revenue is recognized as classroom training is completed  at rates based on the length of the training program 
internet based training services revenue is recognized on a per user basis as self study courses are completed 
help desk revenue is recognized based on a monthly price per registered user under the contract 
services provided by us that are in addition to those provided for in our contracts are billed on a fee for service basis as services are completed 
costs associated with contract revenue are recognized as incurred 
costs that are paid directly by our clients  and for which we do not bear the risk of economic loss  are excluded from revenue 
the termination of a standard contract will not result in a material adjustment to the revenue or costs previously recognized 
in some instances  we offer volume discounts to customers over multiple contracts 
we estimate the volume discounts to be earned over the life the contracts to which the discount applies 
as a contract progresses  revenues are recorded using rates that reflect the anticipated volume discount to be achieved by the customer 
the termination of a contract subject to a volume discount could result in a material adjustment to revenue previously recognized  in order to reflect the true economic value of the contract at the time of cancellation 
for the years ended december  and december   we deferred  and  of revenue  respectively  as a result of our contracts subject to volume discounts 
no revenue was deferred in as a result of volume discounts 
software development costs development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs are capitalized in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
such costs are amortized over the lesser of three years or the economic life of the related product 
we perform an annual review of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are expensed 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees for stock options granted to employees and directors 
we follow the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation for stock options granted to non employees 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  requires disclosure of compensation expense under both apb no 
and sfas no 
the following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value for these options using the black scholes option pricing model 
year ended december weighted average risk free interest rate weighted average volatility of the expected market price of the common shares dividend yield weighted average expected life of the option years years years weighted average fair value per share of options granted for purposes of pro forma disclosures  the estimated value of the options is amortized to expense over the options vesting period 
the following table sets forth stock based compensation and pro forma information for each period presented 
year ended december  net income loss recorded plus stock compensation expense recognized less stock compensation expense that would have been recognized under sfas no 
pro forma net income loss pro forma basic income loss per share pro forma diluted income loss per share on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
on april   the us securities and exchange commission sec announced a deferral of the effective date of sfas r for calendar year end companies until january  as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
 and as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method may have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on january  we will adopt sfas no 
using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning january  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested at the effective date 
we have chosen to use the black scholes option valuation model in valuing stock options granted prior to january   and will continue to use this valuation model for options granted after the effective date of sfas no 
r 
the adoption of sfas r will increase our operating expenses by approximately  in the aggregate over the four year period beginning in january through december for options that remain unvested as of january  during the year ending december   we expect to record approximately  of stock compensation expense  as a result of the adoption sfas no 
r 
the full impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments in the future  however  at this time we do not anticipate granting any additional stock options 
income taxes the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this accounting standard requires that the liability method be used in accounting for income taxes 
under this accounting method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that apply in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for which realization currently is not certain 
quarterly income taxes are recorded at the statutory rate  based on annual forecasted income 
the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards from prior years 
until  the existence of operating losses provided sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
 requiring a full valuation allowance against datatrak s deferred tax assets 
this situation changed in  as the company realized taxable income of approximately  on a cumulative basis over the past three years 
given datatrak s ability to generate these profits  management now believes that a full valuation allowance on datatrak s deferred tax assets is no longer necessary 
however  because the edc market is still developing  it is difficult to predict taxable income very far into the future 
therefore  the reduction in the valuation allowance of  recorded in reflects estimates of the next three year s taxable income based on actual results  with adjustments for known changes and no assumptions for growth 
the reduction in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is based on historical results and should not be viewed as an estimate of future earnings 
beginning in the first quarter of  datatrak will record a tax provision at the statutory rate against quarterly pre tax income 
an evaluation will be made at each annual reporting period regarding the continuing need for a valuation allowance  and appropriate adjustments to the valuation allowance will be made at such time 
results of operations despite the slow growth of the edc market  our revenue has grown from  in to  in and  in in conjunction with the growth in revenue  our operating expenses increased to  in and  in personnel costs represented approximately  or  of our operating costs during and approximately  or  of our operating costs during we had approximately employees at december  and approximately employees at december  our continued growth in revenue allowed us to record operating income in the amount of  and  for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
during the second half of  we took steps to reduce our annual operating costs  primarily through reductions in personnel costs 
these cost cutting measures enabled us to reduce our personnel costs to  and our total operating expenses to  during at december  we had approximately employees 
our growth in revenue together with the decrease in our operating expenses allowed us to reduce our net operating loss to  in compared to  in the following table shows  for the periods indicated  selected items from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  revenue direct costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income loss from operations other income  net net income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded revenue related to contracts compared to contracts during for the year ended december    of revenue was the result of contracts that were in backlog at december  and  was the result of new business 
for the year ended december    of revenue was generated from contracts that were in backlog at december  and  of revenue was the result of new business 
direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
additional staff and other payroll cost increases accounted for  of the  increase in third party license fees  as a result of our license agreements with microsoft and sas increased by  during other direct costs  which are primarily travel and other costs billed directly to our customers  increased by  during the year ended december  the increase in staff was necessitated by the growth in revenue and the increase in the number of contracts we have been managing over the past year 
our gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include all administrative personnel costs  business and software development costs  and all other expenses not directly chargeable to a specific contract 
these expenses increased by to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additional staff  other payroll cost increases and our sales incentive and operational performance bonus plans accounted for  of the  increase 
expenses related to equipment maintenance and software licensing increased  compared to the prior year 
the increase in these expenses is related to the growth of our information technology infrastructure  and is necessary to ensure that our it infrastructure is properly maintained and licensed 
outside professional service fees  consisting of accounting and auditing  legal and consulting costs  increased by  during of this  increase   was related to our sarbanes oxley compliance efforts   was due to non capitalized software development costs associated with development and modification of internal operating systems and the remainder was due to initiatives related to enhancing our sales and marketing efforts and other corporate initiatives 
during the year ended december    of expense was recorded as a result of our previously disclosed new director compensation program 
cost increases in all other areas  primarily related to our overall growth  resulted in additional expenses of  during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense increased to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the increase is due to our increased level of capital spending over the past fifteen months 
from october  through december   we had capital expenditures totaling  this compares to  of capital expenditures in the period from june  through september  other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  other income includes interest income  which increased by  the increase in interest income was the result of the our increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily due to our december private placement of common shares and positive cash flow during along with increasing interest rates on its investments 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of  this was the result of a  decrease in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the decrease in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was offset by us federal alternative minimum tax of  due to our net loss carryforwards  we had no state or local income tax expense in at december  we had a net operating loss carryforward of  for united states income tax purposes 
an equity transaction completed on january  has limited our net operating loss carryforwards  incurred prior to that date  to a maximum amount of  per year  under section of the internal revenue code 
all of our united states net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in the year and will be fully expired in the year the company also has a net operating loss carryforward of approximately  euro for german income tax purposes with no expiration date 
for the three years ended december   we realized taxable income of approximately  on a cumulative basis 
given our ability to generate profits over the past three years  we believe that a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets is no longer necessary 
however  because the edc market is still developing  it is difficult to predict taxable income very far into the future 
therefore  the reduction in the valuation allowance of  recorded in reflects estimates of the next three year s taxable income based on actual results  with adjustments for known changes and no assumptions for growth  and therefore should not be viewed as an estimate of future earnings 
at december   a valuation allowance of approximately  remains against our deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards for both us and non u 
s income taxes 
of the  total allowance  approximately  is recorded against the portion of our deferred tax assets that represent net operating loss carryforwards for u 
s income taxes  and approximately  is recorded against the portion of our deferred tax assets that represent net operating loss carryforwards for german income taxes 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  for the year ended december  included in revenue for the year ended december   is a one time fee of  the  fee relates to consulting work performed for a current customer that was outside of a traditional edc contract 
during the year ended december   we recorded revenue related to contracts compared to contracts during for the year ended december    of revenue was the result of contracts that were in backlog at december  and  was the result of new business 
for the year ended december    of revenue was generated from contracts that were in backlog at december  and  was the result of new business 
direct costs of revenue were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
additional staff and other payroll cost increases accounted for  of the  increase in third party license fees  as a result of our license agreements with microsoft and sas  increased by  during other direct costs  which are primarily travel and other costs billed directly to our customers  increased by  during the year ended december  the increase in staff was necessitated by the growth in revenue and the increase in the number of contracts being managed 
our gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the  one time revenue item caused a increase in gross margin in sg a expenses increased by to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additional staff  other payroll cost increases and our new sales incentive and operational and corporate performance bonus plans accounted for  of the  increase 
expenses related to equipment maintenance and software licensing increased  compared to the prior year 
the increase in these expenses is related to the growth of our information technology infrastructure  and is necessary to ensure that our it infrastructure is properly maintained 
consulting costs  primarily associated with non capitalized software development and testing  increased by  during cost increases in other areas  primarily due to the increased marketing of datatrak edc  and development of the company s corporate infrastructure  resulted in additional expenses of  during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense fell to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the decrease was the result of aging assets  whose replacement was deferred to future periods  not being replaced as indicated by the low level of capital expenditures during of  during  we increased capital expenditures to a total of  other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  other income includes interest income  which increased  for the year ended december  compared to december   primarily due to increasing interest rates during the year 
during  we provided for us federal alternative minimum tax of  due to our net loss carryforwards  we had no other federal  state or local income tax expense in liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash have been cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
our investing activities primarily reflect capital expenditures and purchases and maturities of short term investments 
in december  we received approximately  in net proceeds from the completion of a private placement of our common shares 
contracts with our customers usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at the time the contract is initiated 
additional payments are generally received monthly as work on the contract progresses 
we record all amounts received as a liability deferred revenue until work has been completed and revenue is recognized 
cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred or revenue recognized 
we typically receive a low volume of large dollar receipts 
our accounts receivable will fluctuate due to the timing and size of cash receipts 
our contracting and collection practices are designed to maintain an average collection period for accounts receivable of one to three months 
any increase in our normal collection period for accounts receivable could negatively impact our cash flow from operations and our working capital 
at december   our average collection period for accounts receivable was days compared to days at december  accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  and  at december  deferred revenue was  at december  compared to  at december  cash and cash equivalents increased  during the year ended december  this was the result of  provided by operating activities   used in investing activities and  provided by financing activities 
foreign currency fluctuations caused a  decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
cash provided by operating activities was the result of the company s net income of  plus non cash operating items of  this  increase along with the  increase in deferred revenue was offset by the  increase in accounts receivable  which was caused by our growth in revenue during  and the  increase in deferred tax assets 
changes in other current assets and liabilities caused cash from operating activities to increase by  investing activities included net cash proceeds of  from purchases and maturities of short term investments and  used to purchase property and equipment 
financing activities consist of net proceeds from the issuance of common shares resulting from exercises of common share options offset by costs associated with the company s private placement of common shares and warrants to purchase its common shares 
at december   we had working capital of  and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  our working capital has increased by  since december  the increase was the result of the  increase in our cash  cash equivalents  due to our cash flow from operations and sales of common shares as a result of the exercise of common share options and warrants 
the current portion of our deferred tax assets increased by  changes in other current assets and liabilities caused working capital to decrease by we are party to a lease agreement that requires us to maintain a restricted cash balance 
our restricted cash balance was  at december  we have established a line of credit  with a bank  that allows us to borrow up to a certain percentage of our investments  as determined by the type of investment  held at the bank 
the line of credit bears interest at rates based on the prime rate  and is payable on demand 
we had no amounts outstanding against this line of credit at december  the terms of our recently completed acquisition of clickfind required us to pay approximately  of cash to the former shareholders of clickfind in february we also issued notes payable to the former shareholders of clickfind in the amount of  that bear interest at prime plus  and are payable in installments of   and  on february   and  respectively 
we are responsible for the costs of integrating clickfind s operations with our current operations  and all future operating costs of clickfind 
during the twelve months ended december   click find recorded revenue of  and incurred operating costs of  we intend to fund these additional costs with our cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments  cash flow from operations and borrowings against our line of credit 
we intend to continue to fund the enhancement and testing of the datatrak edc software  as well invest in the development  enhancement and testing of datatrak eclinical 
our operations and the edc market are still in a developmental stage 
we have experienced revenue growth  and anticipate positive cash flow from operations during as we continue to build our customer base  increase our backlog and convert our current backlog into revenue 
we anticipate capital and related expenditures of approximately  for the twelve months ending december   for the continued commercialization and enhancement of our two clinical trial product offerings as well as improvements to our internal operating systems 
of the  total   is required to maintain and upgrade current systems 
the remaining  is in conjunction with the anticipated growth of our business  and is to some extent discretionary 
additionally  we anticipate spending approximately  for maintenance of our information technology infrastructure during our research and development expenditures have historically been for the continued enhancement of and modifications to our datatrak edc software 
for the twelve months ended december   we expensed approximately  for research and development 
during  we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase by approximately  to  compared to our research and development expenditures will be for the continued enhancement and modifications to our datatrak edc and datatrak eclinical software solutions  the integration with sas drug development software and the development of our dataunifyer product 
we expect to fund our working capital requirements from existing cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments  cash flow from operations and borrowings against our line of credit 
we believe that  with the continued anticipated growth in revenue  our cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to offset delays or cancellations of contacts  support expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technology or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we may raise additional funds by selling debt or equity securities  by entering into strategic relationships or through other arrangements 
additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional equity capital is raised  it could have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders 
contractual obligations the table below shows our contractual cash obligations  expressed in thousands  at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations our purchase obligations consist of the final  payment  which was made in january  to sas for access to the sas drug development software 
our recent acquisition of clickfind resulted in a  purchase obligation that was paid in february  and  in debt obligations that will be paid in installments of   and  on february   and  respectively 
these obligations are not included in our contractual obligations as of december  inflation to date  we believe that the effects of inflation have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates since we fund our operations through short term investments and have business transactions in euros 
a summary of our primary market risk exposures is presented below 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
a change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in an  change in our interest income during the year 
foreign currency risk our foreign results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations through both foreign currency transaction and foreign currency translation adjustments 
we manage our risk to foreign currency transaction adjustments by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our financial position and results of operations are impacted by translation adjustments caused by the conversion of foreign currency accounts and operating results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro at december  would have resulted in a  change in the foreign currency translation amount recorded on our balance sheet  due to foreign currency translations 
a fluctuation in the average exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro for the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in our net income for the year ended december   due to foreign currency translations 
during the average exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar increased by approximately 
the conversion of our foreign operations into us dollars upon consolidation resulted in net income that was approximately  lower than would have been recorded had the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar remained consistent with rates
