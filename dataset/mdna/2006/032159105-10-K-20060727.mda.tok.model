item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction for a description of the company s business  refer to item i of part i of this annual report on form k 
as indicated in item i  the company is primarily engaged in three business segments the real estate business operated by amrep southwest and the fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses operated by kable 
data concerning industry segments is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s foreign sales and activities are not significant 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended april   and critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include i the determination of revenue recognition for the newsstand distribution services business  which is based on estimates of allowances for magazine returns to the company from wholesalers and the offsetting return of magazines by the company to publishers for credit  ii allowances for doubtful accounts  iii real estate cost of sales calculations  which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete  iv the determination of revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method for certain construction contracts  which is determined based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the project  v cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets and assets held for sale  vi pension plan accounting  and vii legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
certain of the most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following i newsstand distribution services revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers that are recorded by the company at the time the publications go on sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the publications generally are sold on a fully returnable basis  which is in accordance with prevailing trade practice 
accordingly  the company provides for estimated returns by charges to income that are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing historical experience and current sales information 
the financial impact to the company of a change in the sales estimate for magazine returns to it from its wholesalers is substantially offset by the simultaneous change in the company s estimate of its cost of purchases since it passes on the returns to publishers for credit 
as a result  the effect of a difference between the actual and estimated return rates on the company s commission revenues is the amount of the commission attributable to the difference 
the effect of an increase or decrease in the company s estimated rate of returns of during any period would be dependent upon the mix of magazines involved and the related selling prices and commission rates  but would generally result in a change in that period s net commission revenues of approximately  ii management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  iii real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred  iv percentage of completion revenue recognition for certain construction contracts is based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  changes in the costs of subcontractors  materials and equipment  productivity and scheduling  v asset impairment determinations including that of goodwill are based upon the intended use of assets and expected future cash flows  vi pension plan accounting and disclosure is based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities the discount rate  and certain employee related factors such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
the effect of every change in the investment rate of return on retirement plan assets would increase or decrease the pension expense by approximately  per year  and a change in the discount rate of at a fiscal year end would result in an increase or decrease in the subsequent year s pension cost of approximately  and vii the company is currently involved in one significant legal proceeding which is described in item of this annual report on form k  and several routine matters 
if the summary judgment in favor of the defendants  including the company  were reversed upon appeal in the significant proceeding and if the plaintiffs were then to prevail in the case  the result could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an outcome of other litigation that is significantly different from our assumptions 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  results of operations net income in was  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share  in the results consisted of net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and net income from discontinued operations of  or per share  versus net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and a net loss from discontinued operations of  or per share  in the substantial increase in net income from continuing operations in was attributable to significant revenue growth and the resulting gross profits achieved in the company s real estate operations 
consolidated revenues increased to  in from  in as a result of the increased real estate revenues  partially offset by decreased revenues from the company s media services operations as described below 
net income from discontinued operations in reflected the gain from the disposition of the primary assets of the company s el dorado  new mexico water utility subsidiary  which were taken through condemnation proceedings 
the company began accounting for this subsidiary as a discontinued operation in the quarter ended january  accordingly  financial information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
revenues from land sales at the company s amrep southwest subsidiary increased approximately  from  in to  in  resulting in significantly higher gross profits in compared to the prior year 
this substantial revenue increase was due to increased sales of both developed and undeveloped lots in the company s principal market of rio rancho  new mexico 
an increase in revenues from the sale of developed lots to homebuilders from  in to  in demonstrated the continuing strength of the rio rancho market  while revenues from the sale of undeveloped builder lots increased from  in to  in principally due to one large transaction that was part of a redevelopment project being undertaken by another company 
revenues from sales of commercial and industrial properties decreased slightly in  from  in to  in  as the prior year included one large sale that represented a major component of the revenues whereas activity consisted of numerous smaller transactions 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales decreased to in from in  reflecting the relative mix of lots sold in each year 
revenues and related gross profits from land sales can vary significantly from period to period as a result of many factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
revenues from kable s fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses collectively  media services operations decreased approximately  from  in to  in this revenue decline was due to a decrease in fulfillment services revenues of  offset in part by a  increase in newsstand distribution services revenues 
although there are multiple revenue streams in the fulfillment services business  including revenues from the maintenance of customer computer files and the performance of other fulfillment related activities  including telephone call center support and graphic arts and lettershop services  a customer generally contracts for and utilizes all available services as a total package  and the company would not provide its ancillary services to a customer unless it was also providing the core service of maintaining a data base of names 
thus  variations in fulfillment revenues are the result of fluctuations in the number and sizes of customers rather than in the demand for a particular service 
this is also true in the newsstand distribution services business where there is only one primary service provided which results in one revenue source  the commissions earned on the distribution of magazines 
the company competes with other companies  including three much larger companies in the newsstand distribution services business and one much larger company in the fulfillment services business  and the competition for new customers is intense in both segments  which results in a price sensitive industry which may restrict the company s ability to increase its prices 
the revenue decline in fulfillment services in was principally caused by customer losses that occurred in earlier periods at kable s colorado fulfillment services business that was acquired from electronic data systems corporation eds in fiscal  while revenues of newsstand distribution services increased primarily because decreases in gross billings to existing customers were offset by additional revenues generated by new business 
total operating expenses of the media services operation decreased by  in compared to  with the operating expenses of fulfillment services decreasing  compared to the prior year principally due to decreases in payroll and other variable expenses resulting from the fulfillment services revenue decrease as well as the non recurrence of certain consulting expenses incurred in the prior year 
fulfillment operating expenses amounted to of related revenues in compared to in operating expenses for newsstand distribution services decreased  in compared to principally as a result of certain one time marketing costs  and these expenses amounted to of related revenues in compared to in real estate commissions and selling expenses decreased from  in to  in  representing approximately and of related revenues in each year  the higher rate in was primarily due to legal and other closing costs associated with condemnation proceedings related to the company s last parcel of land in florida 
such costs generally vary depending upon the terms of specific sale transactions 
real estate and corporate general and administrative expenses increased by  in as a result of an increase in the company s stock price which is used to value the portion of director compensation that is paid in stock  the addition of a corporate general counsel and the presence in the prior year of a sublease on certain corporate office space which offset a portion of the company s rental expense 
general and administrative costs of media services operations decreased by approximately  from to  and remained at approximately of kable s total revenues in both years 
interest and other revenues  which consist primarily of interest on real estate mortgage loans and rental income  increased from  in to  in as a result of higher average balances of invested cash and cash equivalents during other expenses primarily consist of expenses associated with rental operations and real estate taxes on land parcels not under development  and these expenses decreased from approximately  in to  in  principally due to costs incurred in to settle certain warranty claims related to the company s previously discontinued homebuilding operations 
the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared to in the decrease from the statutory rate in both years was primarily due to tax benefits associated with charitable contributions of land 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  results of operations consolidated revenues increased from  in to  in  or  as a result of revenue growth in the company s real estate operations that was partially offset by decreased revenues from kable s media services operations 
net income from continuing operations increased from  or per share  in to  or per share  in  primarily as a result of the increased revenues and higher gross margins on land sales in the real estate operations 
revenues from land sales increased approximately  from  in to  in this improvement was the result of an increased volume of sales of both developed and undeveloped lots in the company s principal market of rio rancho  new mexico  including the sales of several large parcels for commercial development in rio rancho 
the gross profit percentages on land sales were and in and as previously noted  revenues and related gross profits from land sales can vary significantly from period to period as a result of many factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
revenues from media services operations decreased from  in to  in this decrease of was the net result of a decline in the fulfillment services segment offset in part by a increase in the newsstand distribution services segment 
the decline in fulfillment services revenues was anticipated and principally the result of customer losses at the company s colorado fulfillment business which had been identified and known prior to kable s acquisition of that business from eds in  while the increase in revenues of newsstand distribution services resulted from additional business obtained in connection with the purchase of certain distribution contracts in the third quarter of total operating expenses decreased in compared to  with the operating expenses of fulfillment services decreasing compared to the prior year due in part to decreases in payroll and other variable expenses resulting from the revenue decrease  reduced third party charges for outsourced computer processing and the inclusion in the prior year of approximately  of costs of relocating and centralizing certain fulfillment operations 
fulfillment operating expenses amounted to of related revenues in compared to in operating costs for newsstand distribution services increased in compared to as a result of costs related to the increased revenues acquired in  including additional market study costs incurred in the third and fourth quarters of  and amounted to of related revenues in compared to in real estate commissions and selling expenses increased as a percentage of related revenues  from in to in  due to the closing of a higher mix of land sales in the prior year without the involvement of a broker 
such costs generally vary depending upon the terms of specific sale transactions 
real estate and corporate general and administrative expenses increased in versus  principally due to the effect of an actuarial gain that occurred in the prior year resulting from the curtailment of future service benefits under the company s pension plan  as discussed below 
media services general and administrative costs decreased by approximately  from to  and remained at approximately of total revenues in both years 
interest and other revenues consist primarily of interest on real estate mortgage loans and rental income  and was approximately  in compared to  in other expenses primarily consist of expenses associated with rental operations and real estate taxes on land parcels not under development  and these expenses increased from approximately  in to  in  principally due to costs incurred in to settle certain warranty claims related to the company s previously discontinued homebuilding operations 
results for included the recognition in the third quarter of a pretax gain of approximately  equivalent to per share from the accelerated recognition of a deferred actuarial gain resulting from the curtailment of future service benefits under the company s pension plan 
this transaction resulted in consolidated pension income of  in compared to pension expense of  in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared to in the decrease in was primarily due to tax benefits associated with the charitable contribution of land

the loan agreement requires the maintenance or achievement of certain financial ratios and contains certain other covenants  the most significant of which limit the amount of dividends and other payments that may be made by the borrowers to their parent or other affiliates  as well as capital expenditures and other borrowings 
an additional  is available under this credit arrangement for capital expenditures 
in may   the media services operations loan agreement was amended to provide for an additional  revolving facility to a subsidiary of the newsstand distribution services business on the same terms except for the amount borrowable and the use of proceeds as provided in the existing credit agreement 
the proceeds of borrowings under this arrangement may be used only to pay accounts payable under a magazine distribution agreement with one of the borrower s publisher customers

also  sfas no 
requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds 
the standard is effective for fiscal years ending after september   and does not effect the current presentation of the company s reportable operating segments 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the fsp provides guidance regarding when an investment is impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary and measurement of the impairment loss 
the fsp applies to debt and equity securities  except equity securities accounted for under the equity method 
the fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the application of this fsp to determine its potential impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in addition to these recently issued accounting standards  there are several emerging accounting issues that could potentially impact the company s consolidated financial statements in the future  including i a proposed sfas on fair value measurements exposure draft  ii a proposed interpretation on accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement no 
exposure draft  and iii a proposed sfas accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits preliminary views 
the company will monitor these emerging issues to assess any potential future impact on its consolidated financial statements 
segment information information by industry segment is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this information has been prepared in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related disclosures  which requires that industry segment information be prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which financial information is prepared and evaluated by management for making operating decisions 
a number of assumptions and estimations are required to be made in the determination of segment data  including the need to make certain allocations of common costs and expenses among segments 
on an annual basis  management has evaluated the basis upon which costs are allocated  and has periodically made revisions to these methods of allocation 
accordingly  the determination of pretax income loss contribution of each segment as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements is presented for informational purposes  and is not necessarily the amount that would be reported if the segment were an independent company 
impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to finance the purchase of a new home or sell their existing home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in its real estate or media services operations businesses
