government regulation and legislation the company is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses 
rail operations are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the surface transportation board stb of the united states department of transportation dot  the federal railroad administration of the dot  the occupational safety and health administration osha  as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies 
the stb has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates  routes and services  the sale or abandonment of rail lines  applications for line extensions and construction  and consolidation or merger with  or acquisition of control of  rail common carriers 
the outcome of stb proceedings can affect the profitability of bnsf s business 

table of contents dot and osha have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations  including the transportation of hazardous materials 
state agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law 
bnsf railway s rail operations  as well as those of its competitors  are also subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
these laws cover discharges to water  air emissions  toxic substances  and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
this regulation has the effect of increasing the cost and liabilities associated with rail operations 
environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations  which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
many of bnsf railway s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf railway is now subject to  and will from time to time continue to be subject to  environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
accordingly  bnsf railway may be responsible under cercla and other federal and state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which certain substances may have been released by bnsf railway  its current lessees  former owners or lessees of properties  or other third parties 
further discussion is incorporated by reference from note of the consolidated financial statements 
railroad retirement railroad industry personnel are covered by the railroad retirement system instead of social security 
bnsf railway s contributions under the railroad retirement system have been approximately triple those in industries covered by social security 
the railroad retirement system  funded primarily by payroll taxes on covered employers and employees  includes a benefit roughly equivalent to social security tier i  an additional benefit similar to that allowed in some private defined benefit plans tier ii  and other benefits 
for  the railroad retirement system required up to a percent contribution by railroad employers on eligible wages  while the social security and medicare acts only required a percent contribution on similar wage bases 
competition the business environment in which bnsf railway operates is highly competitive 
depending on the specific market  deregulated motor carriers  other railroads and river barges may exert pressure on price and service levels 
the presence of advanced  high service truck lines with expedited delivery  subsidized infrastructure and minimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non bulk  time sensitive freight 
the potential expansion of longer combination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads 
in order to remain competitive  bnsf railway and other railroads continue to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity 
as railroads streamline  rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises  competition among rail carriers intensifies 
bnsf railway s primary rail competitor in the western region of the united states is the union pacific railroad company up 
other class i railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by bnsf railway 
based on weekly reporting to the association of american railroads  bnsf s share of the western united states rail traffic in was approximately percent

district court of tarrant county  texas  th judicial district is a state court action filed on october  the plaintiffs causes of action include alleged breach of contract  negligence  and breach of fiduciary duties with respect to a special dividend that was paid in by a bnsf predecessor  santa fe southern pacific corporation sfsp 
the complaint alleges that sfsp erroneously informed shareholders as to the tax treatment of the dividend specifically  the apportionment of the dividend as either a distribution of earnings and profits or a return of capital which allegedly caused some shareholders to overpay their income taxes 
the plaintiffs assert  through their expert s report  that sfsp had essentially no accumulated earnings and profits and that the entire dividend distribution should have been treated as a return of capital  rather than the approximately percent that sfsp determined was a return of capital 
on july   the court entered an order denying the plaintiffs requests to certify a class action  and the plaintiffs subsequently filed an appeal of this ruling to the texas court of appeals

table of contents long term debt and other obligations the company s business is capital intensive 
bnsf has historically generated a significant amount of cash from operating activities  which it uses to fund capital additions  service debt  repurchase shares and pay dividends 
additionally  the company relies on access to the debt and leasing markets to finance a portion of capital additions on a long term basis 
bnsf has agreed to acquire locomotives by as of december   bnsf has taken delivery of of the locomotives 
during  bnsf took delivery of locomotives  which were primarily financed through operating leases 
in the first quarter of  bnsf entered into a contractual obligation to acquire  grain cars over the course of the following four years 
through december   bnsf has taken delivery of  of the hoppers  which were primarily financed through operating leases 
the locomotives and grain cars under these agreements have been or are expected to be financed through one or a combination of sources including  but not limited to  cash from operations  capital or operating leases and debt issuances 
the decision on the method used for a particular acquisition financing will depend on market conditions and other factors at that time 
the company also utilizes a commercial paper program backed by a bank revolving credit agreement to manage liquidity needs 
for and the foreseeable future  the company expects that cash from operating activities  access to capital markets  the accounts receivable sales program and the bank revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to enable the company to meet its obligations when due 
the company believes these sources of funds will also be sufficient to fund capital additions that are necessary to maintain its competitiveness and position the company for future revenue growth

in the normal course of business  the company enters into long term contractual requirements for future goods and services needed for the operations of the business 
such commitments are not in excess of expected requirements and are not reasonably likely to result in performance penalties or payments that would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
credit agreement commercial paper and the revolving credit agreement are discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the revolving credit agreement includes covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility  including a minimum consolidated tangible net worth test  a maximum debt to capital test  and a million cross default provision 
at december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
bnsf s tangible net worth is billion greater than the minimum consolidated tangible net worth required under the agreement  and the maximum debt to capital test provides approximately billion of debt capacity above bnsf s outstanding debt as of december   before an event of default would occur under these covenants 
with the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency  any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the agreement 
a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency would be considered an immediate termination event 
off balance sheet arrangements sale of accounts receivable the accounts receivable sales program of santa fe receivables corporation sfrc  as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  includes various provisions that  if triggered  would allow the investors participating in this program  at their option  to cancel the program 
these provisions include a minimum consolidated tangible net worth test and a maximum debt to capital test  which are the same as in the bnsf revolving credit agreements described above 
bnsf s tangible net worth is approximately billion greater than the minimum consolidated tangible net worth required under the agreement  and the maximum debt to capital test provides approximately billion of debt capacity above bnsf s outstanding debt as of december  the company s capacity to sell undivided interests to investors under the accounts receivable sales program was million at december   which was comprised of two million  day accounts receivable facilities 
the company amended these facilities on october   modifying their expiration dates to october management expects to be able to either extend the commitment of the current investors under the accounts receivable sales program past october or to find additional investors in the accounts receivable sales program who will be committed to purchase undivided interests after october the accounts receivable sales program provides efficient financing at a competitive interest rate as compared with traditional borrowing arrangements and provides diversification of funding sources 
since the funding is collateralized by bnsf receivables  the risk of exposure is only as great as the risk of default on these receivables see note of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents guarantees the company acts as guarantor for certain debt and lease obligations of others 
during the past few years the company has primarily utilized guarantees to allow third party entities to obtain favorable terms to finance the construction of assets that will benefit the company 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  bnsf enters into agreements with third parties that include indemnification clauses 
the company does not expect performance under these guarantees or indemnities to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity in the foreseeable future see note of the consolidated financial statements 
inflation due to the capital intensive nature of bnsf s business  the full effect of inflation is not reflected in operating expenses because depreciation is based on historical cost 
an assumption that all operating assets were depreciated at current price levels would result in substantially greater expense than historically reported amounts

critical accounting estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company makes a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting estimates 

table of contents management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates described below with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to them in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
legal bnsf s most significant legal claims relate to personal injury claims and environmental matters 
these claims are discussed in more detail below 
during  bnsf recorded a million pre tax charge to reflect changes in its estimate of unasserted asbestos liabilities and environmental liabilities 
of this amount  million and million were related to unasserted asbestos and environmental liabilities  respectively 
the million pre tax charge was recorded in materials and other expense and reduced net income by million  or per share during personal injury personal injury claims  including asbestos claims and employee work related injuries and third party injuries collectively  other personal injury  are a significant expense for the railroad industry 
personal injury claims by bnsf railway employees are subject to the provisions of the federal employers liability act fela rather than state workers compensation laws 
fela s system of requiring the finding of fault  coupled with unscheduled awards and reliance on the jury system  contributed to increased expenses in past years 
other proceedings include claims by non employees for punitive as well as compensatory damages 
a few proceedings purport to be class actions 
the variability present in settling these claims  including non employee personal injury and matters in which punitive damages are alleged  could result in increased expenses in future years 
bnsf has implemented a number of safety programs designed to reduce the number of personal injuries as well as the associated claims and personal injury expense 
bnsf records a liability for personal injury claims when the expected loss is both probable and reasonably estimable 
the liability and ultimate expense projections are estimated using standard actuarial methodologies 
liabilities recorded for unasserted personal injury claims are based on information currently available 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in projecting future events such as the number of claims filed each year  developments in judicial and legislative standards and the average costs to settle projected claims  actual costs may differ from amounts recorded 
asbestos the company is party to a number of personal injury claims by employees and non employees who may have been exposed to asbestos 
the heaviest exposure for bnsf employees was due to work conducted in and around the use of steam locomotive engines that were phased out between the years of and however  other types of exposures  including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials  continued after  until it was substantially eliminated by 
table of contents prior to  claim filings against the company for asbestos were not numerous and were sporadic 
accordingly  while the company had concluded that a probable loss had occurred  it did not believe it could estimate the range of reasonably possible loss because of the lack of experience with such claims and the lack of detailed employment records for the population of exposed employees 
the company believed  however  that the low end of the range of reasonably possible loss  as that term is used in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss  was immaterial 
subsequent to this period  claim filings increased and  when they continued into  the company concluded that the low end of the range of reasonably possible loss would be material and that an estimate for unasserted asbestos exposure liability needed to be recorded 
bnsf then engaged a third party with extensive experience in performing asbestos studies to assist in assessing the unasserted liability exposure 
the objective of the assessment was to determine the number of estimated unasserted asbestos claims and the estimated average cost per claim 
the company  with the assistance of the third party  first determined its exposed population from which it was able to derive the estimated number of unasserted claims 
the estimated average cost per claim was then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data 
based on the assessment  the company recorded an undiscounted million pre tax charge for unasserted asbestos claims in the third quarter of the million pre tax charge was recorded in materials and other expense and reduced net income by million  or per share  for the year ended december  
table of contents key elements of the assessment included because bnsf did not have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of potentially exposed employees  it computed an estimate using company employee data from forward and estimated the bnsf employee base from using railroad industry historical census data and estimating bnsf s representation in the total railroad population 
the projected incidence of disease was estimated based on epidemiological studies using employees age  duration and intensity of exposure while employed 
an estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease non malignant  cancer and mesothelioma was computed using the company s average historical claim filing rates for the period the years in which the number of claims were more significant 
an estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim was computed using the company s historical average dismissal rates observed in an estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease was computed using the company s historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of incidence observed during from these assumptions bnsf projected the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to arrive at an estimate of the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim 
historical claim filing rates were applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type 
historical dismissal rates  which represent claims that are closed without payment  were then applied to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the company 
finally  the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate bnsf s future liability for unasserted asbestos claims 
the most sensitive assumptions for this accrual are the estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values 
asbestos claim filings are typically sporadic and may include large batches of claims solicited by law firms 
to reflect these factors  bnsf used a multi year calibration period ie  the average historical filing rate for the period because it believed it would be most representative of its future claim experience 
in addition  for non malignant claims  the number of future claims to be filed against bnsf declines at a rate consistent with both mortality and age as there is a decreasing propensity to file a claim as the population ages 
bnsf believes the average claim values by type of disease from the historical period are most representative of future claim values 
non malignant claims  which represent approximately percent of the total number and percent of the cost of estimated future asbestos claims  were priced by age of the projected claimants 
historically  the ultimate settlement value of these types of claims is most sensitive to the age of the claimant 
a percent increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of unasserted claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims 
during the third quarter of  the company obtained an update of this study  which concluded that the original september study continues to represent a reasonable estimate of bnsf s future asbestos exposure 
therefore  management recorded no additional expense as a result of this update 
the company plans to update the study in the third quarter of on a quarterly basis  bnsf monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted claims and expected claim payments 
adjustments to the company s estimates will be recorded when necessary see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents the following table summarizes the activity in the company s accrued obligations for both asserted and unasserted asbestos matters in millions beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december  of the obligations at december   million is related to unasserted claims and million is related to asserted claims 
at december  and  and million are included in current liabilities  respectively 
the recorded liability is not discounted 
in addition  defense and processing costs  which are recorded on an as reported basis  are not included in the recorded liability 
the company is presently self insured for asbestos related claims 
the following table summarizes information regarding the number of asserted asbestos claims filed against bnsf claims unresolved at january  claims filed claims settled  dismissed or otherwise resolved claims unresolved at december  based on bnsf s estimate of the potentially exposed employees and related mortality assumptions  it is anticipated that unasserted claims will continue to be filed through the year the company recorded an amount for the full estimated filing period through because it had a relatively finite exposed population former and current employees hired prior to which it was able to identify and reasonably estimate and about which it had obtained reliable demographic data including age  hire date and occupation derived from industry or bnsf specific data that was the basis for the study 
bnsf projects that approximately   and percent of the future unasserted asbestos claims will be incurred within the next   and years  respectively 
because of the uncertainty surrounding the factors used in the study  it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle asbestos claims may range from approximately million to million 
however  bnsf believes that the million recorded at december   is the best estimate of the company s future obligation for the settlement of asbestos claims 
the amounts recorded by bnsf for the asbestos related liability were based upon currently known facts 
future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of claims  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than projected 
while the final outcome of asbestos related matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded  it is the opinion of bnsf that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity 
however  should a number of these items occur in the same period  it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year 

table of contents other personal injury bnsf uses a third party actuary to assist the company in estimating its other personal injury liability claims and expense 
these estimates are based on the covered population  activity levels and trends in frequency  and the costs of covered injuries 
these actuarial estimates include unasserted claims except for certain repetitive stress and other occupational trauma claims that result from prolonged repeated events or exposure 
such claims are estimated on an as reported basis because  while the company has concluded that a probable loss has occurred  it cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible loss due to other contributing causes of such injuries and the fact that continued exposure is required for the potential injury to manifest itself as a claim 
the company believes that the low end of the range of reasonably possible loss  as that term is used in fin  is immaterial for these other occupational trauma claims 
key elements of the actuarial assessment include size and demographics employee age and craft of the workforce 
activity levels manhours by employee craft and carloadings 
expected claim frequency rates by type of claim employee fela or third party liability based on historical claim frequency trends 
expected dismissal rates by type of claim based on historical dismissal rates 
expected average paid amounts by type of claim for open and incurred but not reported claims that eventually close with payment 
from these assumptions  bnsf estimates the number of open claims by accident year that will likely require payment by the company 
the projected number of open claims by accident year that will require payment is multiplied by the expected average cost per claim by accident year and type to determine bnsf s estimated liability for all asserted claims 
additionally  bnsf estimates the number of its incurred but not reported claims that will likely result in payment based upon historical emergence patterns by type of claim 
the estimated number of projected claims by accident year requiring payment is multiplied by the expected average cost per claim by accident year and type to determine bnsf s estimated liability for incurred but not reported claims 
the most sensitive assumptions for this accrual are the expected average cost per claim and the projected frequency rates for the number of claims that will ultimately result in payment 
a percent increase or decrease in either the expected average cost per claim or the frequency rate for claims with payment would result in an approximate million increase or decrease in bnsf s recorded other personal injury reserves see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
bnsf obtains quarterly actuarial updates for other personal injury liabilities and monitors actual experience against the number of forecasted claims to be received  the forecasted number of claims closing with payment and expected claims payments 
adjustments to the company s estimates are recorded quarterly as necessary or more frequently as new events or revised estimates develop 
the following table summarizes the activity in the company s accrued obligations for other personal injury matters in millions beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december  
table of contents at december  and  million and million are included in current liabilities  respectively 
bnsf s liabilities for other personal injury claims are undiscounted 
in addition  defense and processing costs  which are recorded on an as reported basis  are not included in the recorded liability 
the company is substantially self insured for other personal injury claims 
the following table summarizes information regarding the number of personal injury claims  other than asbestos  filed against bnsf claims unresolved at january  claims filed claims settled  dismissed or otherwise resolved claims unresolved at december  because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of other personal injury claims  it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle other personal injury claims may range from approximately million to million 
however  bnsf believes that the million recorded at december   is the best estimate of the company s future obligation for the settlement of other personal injury claims 
the amounts recorded by bnsf for other personal injury claims were based upon currently known facts 
future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of claims  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding personal injury litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs to be higher or lower than projected 
while the final outcome of these other personal injury matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded  it is the opinion of bnsf that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity 
however  should a number of these items occur in the same period  it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year 

table of contents environmental the company s operations  as well as those of its competitors  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental regulation 
bnsf s operating procedures include practices to protect the environment from the risks inherent in railroad operations  which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials 
additionally  many of bnsf s land holdings are and have been used for industrial or transportation related purposes or leased to commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property 
as a result  bnsf is subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions 
in particular  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  also known as the superfund law  as well as similar state laws generally impose joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct 
bnsf has been notified that it is a potentially responsible party prp for study and cleanup costs at superfund sites for which investigation and remediation payments are or will be made or are yet to be determined the superfund sites and  in many instances  is one of several prps 
in addition  bnsf may be considered a prp under certain other laws 
accordingly  under cercla and other federal and state statutes  bnsf may be held jointly and severally liable for all environmental costs associated with a particular site 
if there are other prps  bnsf generally participates in the cleanup of these sites through cost sharing agreements with terms that vary from site to site 
costs are typically allocated based on such factors as relative volumetric contribution of material  the amount of time the site was owned or operated  and or the portion of the total site owned or operated by each prp 
liabilities for environmental cleanup costs are recorded when bnsf s liability for environmental cleanup is both probable and reasonably estimable 
subsequent adjustments to initial estimates are recorded as necessary based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies as well as costs for remediation of sites determined to be contaminated 
during the first half of  the company experienced a significant increase in expense relating to environmental remediation developments at known sites for which the majority of the contamination occurred decades ago 
because of these and other developments  the company performed an assessment in to determine if it was feasible to better estimate developments at its known sites 
the company determined that a third party actuary had proprietary data that included information from the environmental protection agency epa and other governmental agencies as well as information accumulated from public sources and work performed for other clients 
because of its determination that a better estimate of future development could be made with this data  bnsf engaged this third party actuary  which has an extensive background in performing various studies for large companies  including environmental matters  to assist bnsf in determining the company s potential future environmental exposure at known sites 
as a result of this study  the company revised its estimate of its probable environmental losses and its accrued liabilities 
consequently  during the third quarter of  bnsf recorded an undiscounted million pre tax charge related to its change in estimated environmental liabilities on a site by site basis 
the million pre tax charge was recorded in materials and other expense and reduced net income by million  or per share  for the charge did not include i contaminated sites of which the company is not aware  or ii additional amounts for third party claims  which arise out of contaminants allegedly migrating from bnsf property  due to a limited number of sites 
bnsf continues to estimate third party claims on a site by site basis when the liability for such claims is probable and reasonably estimable 
bnsf s recorded liability for third party claims as of december  is approximately million 

table of contents during the third quarter of  the company obtained an update of this study 
based on the results of the study  management recorded additional expense of approximately million 
the company plans to update the study in the third quarter of on a quarterly basis  bnsf monitors actual experience against the forecasted remediation and related payments made on existing sites 
adjustments to the company s estimates will continue to be recorded when necessary based on developments in subsequent periods 
additionally  environmental accruals include amounts for newly identified sites or contaminants  third party claims and legal fees incurred for defense of third party claims and recovery efforts see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company s estimate of ultimate cost for cleanup efforts at its known environmental sites utilizes bnsf s historical payment patterns  its current estimated percentage to closure ratios  and the actuary s proprietary benchmark patterns developed from data accumulated from public sources and work performed by it for other clients  including the epa and other governmental agencies 
these factors incorporate experience gained from cleanup efforts at other similar sites into the estimates for which remediation and restoration efforts are still in progress 
the most significant assumptions are as follows i historical payment patterns of site development  and ii variance from benchmark costs 
a percent change in any of these individual assumptions could result in an increase of up to million or a decrease of up to million in bnsf s estimated environmental liability 
bnsf also conducts an ongoing environmental contingency analysis  which considers a combination of factors including independent consulting reports  site visits  legal reviews and analysis of the likelihood of participation in  and the ability to pay for  cleanup of other prps 
bnsf is involved in a number of administrative and judicial proceedings and other mandatory cleanup efforts for sites  including superfund sites  at which it is participating in the study or cleanup  or both  of alleged environmental contamination 
the following table summarizes the activity in the company s accrued obligations for environmental matters in millions beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december  at december  and  million and million are included in current liabilities  respectively 
bnsf s environmental liabilities are not discounted 
bnsf anticipates that the majority of the accrued costs at december  will be paid over the next ten years and no individual site is considered to be material 
the following table summarizes the environmental sites bnsf sites superfund sites number of sites at january  sites added during the period sites closed during the period number of sites at december  
table of contents liabilities recorded for environmental costs represent bnsf s best estimate of its probable future obligation for the remediation and settlement of these sites and include both asserted and unasserted claims 
unasserted claims are not a material component of the liability 
although recorded liabilities include bnsf s best estimate of all probable costs  without reduction for anticipated recoveries from third parties  bnsf s total cleanup costs at these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to various factors such as the extent of corrective actions that may be required  evolving environmental laws and regulations  advances in environmental technology  the extent of other parties participation in cleanup efforts  developments in ongoing environmental analyses related to sites determined to be contaminated  and developments in environmental surveys and studies of contaminated sites 
because of the uncertainty surrounding these factors  it is reasonably possible that future costs for environmental liabilities may range from approximately million to million 
however  bnsf believes that the million recorded at december   is the best estimate of the company s future obligation for environmental costs 
while the final outcome of these environmental matters cannot be predicted with certainty  it is the opinion of bnsf that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity 
however  an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year 

table of contents other claims and litigation in addition to asbestos  other personal injury  and environmental matters discussed above  bnsf and its subsidiaries are also parties to a number of other legal actions and claims  various governmental proceedings and private civil suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including those related to disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges including complaints seeking refunds of prior charges paid for coal transportation and the prescription of future rates for such movements 
some of the legal proceedings include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages  and a few proceedings purport to be class actions 
while the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty  considering among other things the meritorious legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance  it is the opinion of bnsf that none of these items  when finally resolved  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or liquidity 
however  an unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in a particular quarter or fiscal year 
income taxes bnsf is subject to various federal  state and local income taxes in the taxing jurisdictions where the company operates 
bnsf accounts for income taxes by providing for taxes payable or refundable in the current year and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns 
bnsf recorded total income tax expense  including federal  state and other income taxes  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
bnsf s consolidated balance sheets reflect million and million of net current deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively 
also included in bnsf s consolidated balance sheets are  million and  million of net non current deferred tax liabilities at december  and  respectively 
classification of deferred tax assets and liabilities as current or non current is determined by the financial statement classification of the asset or liability to which the temporary difference is related 
if a temporary difference is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  it is classified according to the expected reversal date of the temporary difference 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
bnsf has not recorded a valuation allowance  as it believes that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized in the future 
all federal income tax returns of bnsf s predecessor companies  burlington northern inc and santa fe pacific corporation are closed through and the business combination date of september   respectively 
internal revenue service examination of the years through for bnsf is completed  and the unagreed issues are pending before internal revenue service irs appeals 
bnsf is currently under examination for years through in addition  bnsf and its subsidiaries have various state income tax returns in the process of examination  administrative appeal or litigation 
due to the capital intensive nature of bnsf s business  a significant portion of the audit issues with the irs and other taxing authorities relate to whether expenditures are classified as maintenance or capital and whether certain asset valuations are appropriate 
a provision for taxes resulting from ongoing and future federal and state audits is based on an estimation of aggregate adjustments that may be required as a result of the audits 
the company believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustment that might be assessed for open years through bnsf makes estimates of the potential liability based on its assessment of all potential tax exposures 
in addition  the company uses factors such as applicable law  current information and past experience with similar issues to make these judgments 

table of contents deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that apply to taxable income in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or paid 
changes in the company s estimates regarding the statutory tax rate to be applied to the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially affect the effective tax rate 
the company has not significantly changed its methodology for calculating income tax expense for the years presented  and there are currently no known trends  demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to occur and materially affect the methodology or assumptions described above 
pensions and other post employment benefits bnsf sponsors a funded  noncontributory qualified bnsf retirement plan  which covers substantially all non union employees  and an unfunded bnsf supplemental retirement plan  which covers certain officers and other employees 
the benefits under these pension plans are based on years of credited service and the highest consecutive sixty months of compensation for the last ten years of salaried employment with bnsf 
bnsf s funding policy is to contribute annually not less than the regulatory minimum and not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes with respect to the funded plan 
certain salaried employees of bnsf that have met age and years of service requirements are eligible for life insurance coverage and medical benefits  including prescription drug coverage  during retirement 
the retiree medical plan is contributory and provides benefits to retirees  their covered dependents and beneficiaries 
retiree contributions are adjusted annually 
the plan also contains fixed deductibles  coinsurance and out of pocket limitations 
the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory and covers retirees only 
optional life insurance coverage is available for some retirees  however  the retiree is responsible for the full cost 
bnsf s policy is to fund benefits payable under the medical and life insurance plans as they come due 
generally  employees beginning salaried employment with bnsf subsequent to september   are not eligible for medical benefits during retirement 
the amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of income for pensions and other post employment benefits opeb were as follows in millions year ended december  estimate net pension cost benefit net other post employment benefits cost the increased pension cost in   and is primarily the result of recognition of previously unrecognized losses as well as a decrease in both the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions 
other post employment benefits costs are expected to increase in due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate and an increase in the assumed cost of future health care benefits 
at december   bnsf had unrecognized net losses of million and million related to the pension and health and welfare benefits plans  respectively 
these net losses are comprised of gains and losses from changes in discount rates  actuarial assumptions  and census data as well as market gains and losses 
the company will recognize the portion of these net losses that exceeds percent of the benefit obligation as a component of compensation and benefits expense 
the table below outlines the net losses expected to be recognized over the next years 

table of contents deferred losses to be recognized in millions fiscal year pension health and welfare benefits thereafter bnsf uses a third party actuary to assist the company in estimating liabilities and expenses for pension and opeb 
estimated amounts are based on historical information  current information and estimates about future events and circumstances 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of pension or opeb obligations include expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels and the health care cost trend rate 

table of contents from time to time  the company will change pension and opeb assumptions to better approximate current conditions and expected future experience 
significant assumptions for the past three years are as follows pension benefits health and welfare benefits assumptions used to determine net benefit cost for fiscal years ended december  discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumed health care cost trend rate rate of compensation increase b pension benefits health and welfare benefits assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at september a  discount rate assumed health care cost trend rate rate of compensation increase b a the company s pension and opeb plans use a measurement date of september b determined based on historical experience the discount rate is a key assumption used in the estimates of both the pension and opeb expense and liability 
bnsf determined the discount rate by adjusting the moody s aa corporate bond yield to reflect the difference between the duration of the future estimated cash flows of the company s pension and health and welfare plans and the duration of the moody s aa index 
the expected return on plan assets  which reflects the expected long term rates of return on those assets  is also a key assumption 
finally  the health care cost trend rates are also considered a significant assumption and only impact the opeb related estimates 
the discount rate used for the calculation of net benefit cost was lowered to percent to reflect current market conditions 
the expected rate of return on plan assets remained consistent from to  and the company does not expect any significant changes to the current investment allocation of assets 
however  unforeseen changes in the investment markets or other external factors could prompt changes in these estimates in future years 
the following table is an estimate of the impact on future net benefit cost that could result from hypothetical changes to the most sensitive assumptions  the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets sensitivity analysis change in net benefit cost hypothetical discount rate change pension opeb basis point decrease million increase million increase basis point increase million decrease million decrease hypothetical rate of return on plan assets change pension basis point decrease million increase basis point increase million decrease 
table of contents the company contributed million to the bnsf retirement plan in december the company is not required to make any contributions to this plan in the company determines this required funding by amortizing asset gains and losses over a period of five years 
additionally  the company expects to make benefit payments in of approximately million and million to its opeb plan and the bnsf supplemental retirement plan  respectively 
if the company was required to fully fund the unfunded portion of its projected benefit obligation  which was million at december  for the pension plans and million for the health and welfare plan  the company s management believes that it would have sufficient liquidity  and it could fund the balance without a significant impact to the company s financial position 
further information on pensions and other post employment benefits is incorporated by reference from note of the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation due to the capital intensive nature of the railroad industry  depreciation expense is a significant component of the company s operating expense 
the company recorded depreciation and amortization expenses of  million   million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had property and equipment  net balances of  million and  million  which include  million and  million  respectively  of accumulated depreciation 
the company uses the group method of depreciation under which a single depreciation rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property  despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class 
the company conducts studies of depreciation rates and the required accumulated depreciation balance as required by the federal surface transportation board stb  which is generally every three years for equipment property and every six years for track structure and other roadway property 
the company uses external consultants to assist management with these studies 
the consultants rely on statistical analysis  historical retirement data  industry knowledge and discussions with management to assess the impact of new technologies and maintenance practices 
changes in the estimated service lives of the assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively  and the difference between the calculated accumulated depreciation and the amount recorded is amortized over the average remaining service lives of the assets 
a study conducted in resulted in the company adopting new depreciation rates for track structure that resulted in a net decrease in depreciation expense of million and approximately million on an ongoing annual basis  as calculated using the asset base at the time of the rate change 
a study conducted in resulted in the company adopting new depreciation rates for locomotives  other assets  as well as hardware and software that resulted in a net decrease in annual depreciation expense of million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  bnsf utilizes various financial instruments that inherently have some degree of market risk 
the following table summarizes the impact of these hedging activities on the company s results of operations in millions december  fuel hedge benefit including ineffective portion of unexpired hedges interest rate hedge benefit total hedge benefit tax effect hedge benefit  net of tax the company s fuel hedge benefit is due to increases in fuel prices subsequent to the initiation of various hedges 
the interest rate hedge benefit is the result of the conversion of fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt coupled with lower interest rates 
the information presented in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and notes and of the consolidated financial statements describes significant aspects of bnsf s financial instrument activities  which have a material market risk 
additionally  the company uses fuel surcharges to mitigate the risk of fuel price volatility 
commodity price sensitivity bnsf engages in hedging activities to partially mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel purchases 
existing hedge transactions as of december   are based on the front month settlement prices of new york mercantile exchange nymex heating oil ho  west texas intermediate crude oil wti  or the ho refining spread ho wti  which is defined as the difference between ho and wti 
a wti hedge combined with a ho wti hedge will result in the equivalent of a ho hedge 
for swaps  bnsf either pays or receives the difference between the hedge price and the actual average price of the hedge commodity during a specified determination period for a specified number of gallons 
for costless collars  if the average hedge commodity price for a specified determination period is greater than the cap price  bnsf receives the difference for a specified number of gallons 
if the average commodity price is less than the floor price  bnsf pays the difference for a specified number of gallons 
if the commodity price is between the floor price and the cap price  bnsf neither makes nor receives a payment 
hedge transactions are generally settled with the counterparty in cash 
based on historical information  bnsf believes there is a significant correlation between the market prices for diesel fuel  wti  and ho 
at december   bnsf had recorded in the consolidated balance sheet a fuel hedging asset of million for fuel hedges covering and the following table is an estimate of the impact to earnings that could result from hypothetical price changes during the twelve month period ending december  and the balance sheet impact from the hypothetical price changes  both based on hedge position at december  sensitivity analysis hedged commodity price change fuel hedge annual pre tax earnings impact balance sheet impact of change in fuel hedge fair value percent increase million increase million increase percent decrease million decrease million decrease

at december   bnsf maintained fuel inventories for use in normal operations  which were not material to bnsf s overall financial position and  therefore  represent no significant market exposure 
further information on fuel hedges is incorporated by reference from note of the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate sensitivity from time to time  bnsf enters into various interest rate hedging transactions for purposes of managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and establishing rates in anticipation of future debt issuances as well as to convert a portion of its fixed rate long term debt to floating rate debt 
these interest rate hedges are accounted for either as cash flow or fair value hedges 
bnsf s measurement of the fair value of these hedges is based on estimates of the mid market values for the transactions provided by the counterparties to these agreements 
at december   the fair value of bnsf s debt  excluding capital leases  was  million  and the interest rate hedging asset was less than million for fair value hedges and million for cash flow hedges
