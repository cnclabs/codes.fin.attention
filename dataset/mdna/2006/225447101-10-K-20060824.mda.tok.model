item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
overview we develop and manufacture semiconductor materials and electronic devices made from silicon carbide  or sic  gallium nitride  or gan  and related compounds 
the majority of our products are manufactured at our main production facility in durham  north carolina 
we also use subcontractors in asia to perform some of our manufacturing steps for certain led and power products 
we generate revenues from the following product lines led chips and packaged products 
we derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue  green and near uv led chips 
materials products 
our customers purchase our sic and gan wafers for use in manufacturing leds  radio frequency  or rf devices  and power devices or for research and development 
we also sell sic material in bulk crystal form for use in gemstone applications 
high power products 
these products include power switching devices made from sic or gan and wide bandgap rf and microwave devices 
contracts with government agencies 
government agencies assist us in the development of new technology by funding a portion of our research and development efforts 
industry dynamics our business is primarily selling high brightness led products  which is affected by a number of industry factors  including design trends in mobile products  overall demand in products using high brightness leds  a constantly changing competitive environment and intellectual property issues 
currently  the most significant market for our led chips is for illumination purposes in mobile products  including lcd  backlighting  keypad illumination and flash units for camera phones 
led sales for mobile products are impacted by the number of leds used in a product  which varies depending on design trends and the brightness of the leds used in an application 
average led sales prices generally decline each year as market players implement pricing strategies to gain or protect market share 
to remain competitive  led producers generally must increase product performance and reduce costs to support lower average sales prices 
finally  vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights characterize the semiconductor industry 
customers purchasing decisions can be influenced by whether a product may infringe valid intellectual property rights 
fiscal highlights the following is a summary of our financial results for fiscal our revenue from continuing operations increased to million  the highest annual revenue in the company s history  primarily due to growth in high brightness leds  material and high power products 
our gross margin from continuing operations decreased to of revenue from continuing operations primarily driven by lower margins on the sale of leds 
our net income in fiscal included million in stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
we reported consolidated net income of million and net income per diluted share of 
we generated positive cash flow from operations of million 

table of contents outlook for fiscal in fiscal  we are working to increase the brightness of our led chips and help our customers improve their white package performance for mobile white applications 
if we are successful in achieving these goals  we believe that we will have an opportunity to increase sales in the mobile lcd backlight and camera flash markets 
this includes working through the qualification process with our customers for our new ezbright led chips  which are targeted to begin volume shipments in the first quarter of fiscal we target to accelerate cost reductions for both our led and sic based high power products by starting the conversion to four inch wafer production 
additionally  we plan to increase production at our subcontractors to lower our product costs 
we plan to expand the product offerings of our xlamp family of high power packaged led products by incorporating our new ezbright power chips 
we are aiming to introduce higher performance xlamp products to increase sales for specialty lighting  architectural lighting  outdoor lighting street lights and high bay lighting  emergency lighting and personal lighting flashlights markets 
we plan to increase sales of our schottky diode products through expansion of our product line and continued penetration into the power supply markets in computer servers and other applications 
we target to continue expanding our sales  marketing and distribution teams to build a global presence and brand that can deliver enabling products and solutions to the key customers who are driving the emerging applications in led lighting and sic based high power products 
we are targeting to continue to invest in research and development for leds  larger wafers and improved high power devices and expanding our global sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
during fiscal  we plan on investing million to million in capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capacity to support unit volume growth and reduce overall product costs in our led and high power product lines 
the capital expenditures will primarily be in our north carolina locations  but also in asia to support increased production overseas 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic investments and relationships to expand and strengthen our technology  product portfolio and increase access to our targeted markets 
for example  we acquired intrinsic semiconductor corporation intrinsic on july  we believe the technology we acquired in the acquisition will enable us to accelerate the commercialization of low defect inch and inch substrates 
these substrates should not only support our cost roadmap for leds  but more importantly  they should enable us to more rapidly commercialize higher power devices for motor control applications and hybrid vehicles 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews our accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material
