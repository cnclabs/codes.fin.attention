the company sought and received an extension of time to submit its rebuttal until october  and timely submitted the rebuttal on october  in the thirty day letter  the irs proposed several alternative theories as a basis for its argument that alico should have reported additional taxable income in the years under audit 
these theories principally relate to the formation and capitalization of the company s agri insurance subsidiary and its tax exempt status during the years under audit 
under the theories proposed  the irs has calculated additional taxes and penalties due ranging from a minimum of million dollars to a maximum of million dollars 
the letter does not quantify the interest on the proposed taxes  however based on company estimates  as of august  the interest on the additional taxes and penalties ranges from million to million on the proposed adjustments 
the company does not accept the irs position and intends to continue to oppose vigorously any attempt by the irs to impose such assessment in connection with the agri insurance matter

this caused plant world to reduce its inventory by million to its net realizable value and experience unused capacity within its facility  driving the unit costs of plants higher 
a further complication arose as fuel prices continued to rise 
plant world had made commitments to deliver at set prices and in some cases  at very low margins 
the increased delivery costs reduced margins to below cost in many cases 
although plant world was eventually able to exceed its prior year volume  the additional plants were spring vegetable varieties which traditionally have lower margins than fall varieties 
the operations of plant world also suffered from uninsurable hurricane damage and pricing below cost per unit 
beginning in fiscal year  plant world is expanding into several ornamental varieties with higher profit margins per unit

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates the estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
the following critical accounting policies have been identified that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
net realizable value the company records inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
management regularly assesses estimated inventory valuations based on current and forecasted usage of the related commodity and any other relevant factors that may affect the net realizable value 
revenue recognition based on fruit buyers and processors advances to growers  stated cash and futures markets combined with experience in the industry  management reviews the reasonableness of the citrus revenue accrual 
adjustments are made throughout the year to these estimates as more current relevant information regarding the citrus market becomes available 
differences between the estimates and the final realization of revenues can be significant  and the differences between estimated and final results can be either positive or negative 
fluctuation in the market prices for citrus fruit has caused the company to recognize additional revenue from prior years crop totaling thousand  thousand  and thousand during fiscal year   and  respectively 
income from sugarcane under a pooled agreement is recognized at the time the crop is harvested 
based on the processor s advance payment  past sugarcane prices and its experience in the industry  management reviews the reasonableness of the sugarcane revenue accrual 
adjustments are made as additional relevant information regarding the sugar market becomes available 
market price changes to the sugar pool have caused the company to adjust revenue from the prior year s crop by thousand  thousand  and thousand during the fiscal year   and  respectively 
for sales made through bowen  the company applies the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company s application of eitf includes evaluation of the terms of each major customer contract relative to a number of criteria that management considers in making its determination with respect to gross versus net reporting of revenue for transactions with its customers 
management s criteria for making these judgments place particular emphasis on determining the primary obligor in a transaction and which party bears general inventory risk 
bowen purchases and resells citrus fruit  in these transactions  bowen i acts as principal  ii takes title to the products  and iii has the risks and rewards of ownership  including the risk of loss for collection  delivery or returns 
for these transactions  bowen recognizes revenues based on the gross amounts due from customers 
in recognizing revenue from land sales  the company follows the provisions in financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  to record these sales 
sfas no 
provides specific sales recognition criteria to determine when land sales revenue can be recorded 
for example  sfas no 
requires a land sale must be consummated with a sufficient down payment of at least to of the sales price depending upon the type and timeframe for development of the property sold  and that any receivable from the sale cannot be subject to future subordination 
in addition  the seller cannot retain any material continuing involvement in the property sold 
capitalized costs in accordance with statement of position accounting by agricultural producers and agricultural cooperatives  the cost of growing crops are capitalized into inventory until the time of harvest 
once a given crop is harvested  the related inventoried costs are recognized as a cost of sale to provide an appropriate matching of costs incurred with the related revenue earned 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates property and equipment and capitalized development costs for our sugarcane and citrus groves for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets contained in the company s financial statements may not be recoverable 
the impairment calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  the company calculates an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based on estimated future cash flows discounted and with interest charges 
the company recognizes an impairment loss if the amount of the asset s carrying value exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
if an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset will be its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset 
restoration of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
the company operates in several segments and there have been no indicators of impairment 
defined benefit retirement plans the company has a defined benefit deferred compensation plan  whose plan assets consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  and are valued using market quotations 
pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurement 
the company evaluates these critical assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect the company s experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate enables the company to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
at august   the discount rate used to compute the company s defined benefit deferred compensation plan was 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the income tax effect of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred income tax assets to determine whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefits of these assets 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred income tax assets for which it is deemed more likely than not that future taxable income will not be sufficient to realize the related income tax benefits from these assets 
the amount of the net deferred income tax asset that is considered realizable could  however  be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income are adjusted 
the company believes its tax positions comply with the applicable tax laws and that it is adequately provided for all tax related matters 
the internal revenue service irs issued a thirty day letter dated august  pertaining to ongoing audits of alico for the tax years through the letter proposes changes to the company s tax liabilities for each of these tax years and required the company either a to agree with the changes and remit the specified taxes and penalties  or b to submit a rebuttal within days 
the company sought and received an extension of time to submit its rebuttal until october  and timely submitted the rebuttal on october  in the thirty day letter  the irs proposed several alternative theories as a basis for its argument that alico should have reported additional taxable income in the years under audit 
these theories principally relate to the formation and capitalization of the company s agri insurance subsidiary and its tax exempt status during the years under audit 
under the theories proposed  the irs has calculated additional taxes and penalties due ranging from a minimum of million dollars to a maximum of million dollars 
the letter does not quantify the interest on the proposed taxes 
the company does not accept the irs position and intends to continue to oppose vigorously any attempt by the irs to impose such assessment in connection with the agri insurance matter 
however  because management believes it is probable that a challenge will be made and probable that the challenge may be successful as to some of the possible assertions  management has provided for the contingency 
the company has accrued a liability of million and million for the contingency in fiscal years and  respectively 
should the irs prevail in its primary position  the effect would be to significantly reduce the liquidity of the company  and could cause the company to default on several of its loan covenants
