executive overview the equity and derivative trading business has been undergoing significant change for several years 
decimalization  sector trading and index trading strategies have led to an increase in program trading as a percentage of equity trading volume 
block trading has declined and the average trade size has decreased significantly 
the equity markets have also experienced an extended period of lower volatility 
these factors have led to lower principal trading revenues in our specialist and market making segment as the markets have been relatively calm 
our cash equity trading revenues have declined year over year by approximately ten percent  but our trading revenues for our specialist and market making segment have stabilized over the past few quarters 
in addition  increased technology has given us the ability to handle higher volumes without increasing costs 
volumes have remained relatively low over the past few years but returned to a more historical rate of growth in the financial results of our specialist and market making business are highly dependent on trading volumes and volatility 
it is our belief that as volumes grow  market volatility will return as well  which will enable us to participate as principal in more transactions in our specialist and market making operations 
further changes in technology will bring about changes in the way stocks  options and etf s are traded 
the proposed hybrid model  currently being tested by the nyse  is expected to address many of the challenges that have arisen since the advent of decimalization 
the hybrid model will reduce the amount of labor needed to execute and report trades on the nyse 
as proposed by the nyse  the hybrid model is also expected to allow specialists to interact in a fast and more automated market 
it will provide specialists with the tools to add liquidity to the market and to continue to add value to the pricing and trading of individual stocks 
added technology will make our employees more efficient and should allow us to manage our compensation costs more effectively 
we believe that these coming changes will affect the way in which stocks are traded  yet preserve the fundamental elements of today s auction market 
even with the completed nyse archipelago merger and the hybrid model and sec s regulation nms initiatives  senior nyse officials have continued to publicly state that there will continue to be an auction market with a central point of sale 
they have also stated that specialists will continue to play an integral role in providing liquidity and will continue to have an affirmative obligation to make a fair and orderly market 
there is some speculation that large issuers stocks will trade entirely electronically with minimal participation by specialists 
a specialist s primary role is to provide liquidity by committing capital when market imbalances occur  and we believe that technology cannot eliminate these market imbalances 
with this in mind  we are anticipating that specialists will continue to play an important role in all listed stocks 
we believe that our cash equity business will improve as trading volumes and market volatility grow 
structured products such as etfs have grown in popularity 
etfs which have some characteristics similar to sector and index funds trade continually throughout the day on an exchange 
the liquidity and flexibility of being exchange traded has led to substantial growth in these products 
etf assets grew to approximately billion as of december  from billion as of december  we have become a leading specialist in etfs as the number of etfs has increased 
etfs now represent ownership of securities in asia and emerging markets  as well as securities comprising indexes 
we believe that the growth in these products will increase as investors seek to lower investment costs  manage tax liability and hedge portfolio risks 
it is our intention to continue to work with etf issuers as they seek to successfully launch new products and to provide added liquidity which will aid the growth of individual etfs 
we also believe that options  indexes and other structured products will trade differently 
certain option indexes and etfs which do not require price discovery as a result of the liquidity and transparency of underlying securities  will trade more electronically in a matching facility 
we believe more complicated option and etf products will require liquidity provided by a specialist or primary market maker to best maximize price discovery 
we anticipate that these products will trade in an electronic format linked to a liquidity provider with an affirmative obligation to ensure best possible pricing 
the emergence of exchanges that offer multiple trading venues and products signifies that the trading of cash equities  fixed income  options and structured products may be converging into several marketplaces 
we believe that this trend will accelerate and that the traditional cash equity specialist business will be increasingly linked to other trading strategies 
as evidenced by our specialist and market making revenue growth from million in to million in  we believe we have successfully begun to execute our strategy to become a leading specialist and market maker in this new trading environment

please refer to footnote  summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information and disclosure 
critical accounting estimates goodwill and other intangible assets we determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and the fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in determining fair value  we use standard analytical approaches to business enterprise valuation bev  such as the market comparable approach and the income approach 
the market comparable approach is based on comparisons of the subject company to similar companies engaged in an actual merger or acquisition or to public companies whose stocks are actively traded 
as part of this process  multiples of value relative to financial variables  such as earnings or stockholders equity  are developed and applied to the appropriate financial variables of the subject company to indicate its value 
the income approach involves estimating the present value of the subject company s future cash flows by using projections of the cash flows that the business is expected to generate  and discounting these cash flows at a given rate of return 
each of these bev methodologies requires the use of management estimates and assumptions 
for example  under the market comparable approach  we assigned a certain control premium to the public market price of our common stock as of the valuation date of our year end impairment test  in estimating the fair value of our specialist reporting unit 
similarly  under the income approach  we assumed certain growth rates for our revenues  expenses  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  returns on working capital  returns on other assets and capital expenditures  among others 
we also assumed certain discount rates and certain terminal growth rates in our calculations 
for our year end goodwill impairment tests  we engaged an independent business valuation firm to assist us in our bev analyses 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of fair value of our goodwill 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying value of our goodwill on an annual calendar basis ie  december unless an event or change in circumstances would require an interim reassessment of impairment 
during  there were no interim changes in circumstances that necessitated goodwill impairment testing prior to our annual required testing of goodwill 
as a result of our analysis of the above mentioned factors for the year ended december   with the assistance of the independent business valuation firm  we determined that there has been no impairment of our goodwill under sfas no 
we cannot provide assurance that future goodwill impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
our other intangible assets  as defined under sfas no 
 consists of our trade name 
we determine the fair value of our trade name by applying the income approach using the royalty savings methodology 
this method assumes that the trade name has value to the extent we are relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from it 
application of this methodology requires estimating an appropriate royalty rate  which is typically expressed as a percentage of revenue 
estimating an appropriate royalty rate includes reviewing evidence from comparable licensing agreements and considering qualitative factors affecting the trade name 
given the subjectivity involved in selecting which bev approach to use and in determining the input variables for use in our analyses  it is possible that a different valuation model and the selection of different input variables could produce a materially different estimate of fair value of our trade name 
we review the reasonableness of the carrying amount of our trade name on an annual basis in conjunction with our goodwill impairment assessment 
as of december   no impairment of our trade name existed 
we cannot provide assurance that future trade name impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
we amortize our identifiable intangible stock listing rights over their estimated useful lives in accordance with sfas no 
 and test for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
an impairment loss  calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
as a result of our testing and analysis for the year ended december   with the assistance of an independent business valuation firm  we determined that there has been no impairment of our stock listing rights under sfas no 
we cannot provide assurance that future stock listing rights impairment testing will not result in impairment charges in subsequent periods 
non marketable securities the use of fair value to measure certain non marketable investments is a critical accounting estimate 
investments in non marketable securities consist of investments in equity securities of private companies  limited liability company interests and limited partnership interests  which do not have readily available price quotations 
certain investments in non marketable securities are initially carried at cost  as an approximation of fair value 
adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
for certain other investments in non marketable securities  we adjust their carrying value by applying the equity method of accounting  and for our investment in a limited partnership interest  we adjust its carrying value by recognizing our share of the partnership s quarterly results of operations 
in addition  if and when available  management considers other relevant factors relating to non marketable investments in estimating their fair value  such as the financial performance of the entity  its cash flow forecasts  trends within that entity s industry and any specific rights associated with our investment such as conversion features among others 
given management s judgment involved in valuing certain of our non marketable securities  it is possible  as of a given point in time  that a third party could reach a different conclusion of fair value utilizing the same variables as we have in our analysis 
other than temporary impairment of exchange memberships the determination of the fair value of our exchange memberships is a critical accounting estimate 
exchange memberships owned by us are originally carried at cost  pursuant to the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide brokers and dealers in securities 
adjustments to carrying value are made if we deem that an other than temporary decline in value  as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  and in section m of topic of the sec staff accounting bulletin series sab no 
 has occurred 
in determining whether the value of our owned exchange memberships is impaired ie  fair market value is below cost and whether such impairment is temporary or other than temporary  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  information regarding recent sale and lease prices of exchange memberships  historical trends of sale and lease prices of memberships on a particular exchange and their duration  the current condition of the particular exchange s market structure  legal and regulatory developments affecting the particular exchange s market structure and earnings capability  trends in new listings on the particular exchange  general global and national economic factors and our knowledge and judgment of the specialist and execution and clearing industries and the securities market as a whole 
as a result of our analysis of the above mentioned factors for the year ended december   we believe the carrying values of our owned exchange memberships were not impaired 
we cannot provide assurance that the consistent application of this accounting policy to future reporting periods will not result in further adjustments to the carrying value of any of our remaining exchange memberships following the consummation of the nyse merger with archipelago 
this accounting policy  however  will no longer be applied in future periods to our nyse specialist operations because our nyse memberships were surrendered in connection with the nyse archipelago merger and our nyse specialist operations and clearing operations will be conducted through trading licenses on the new nyse market 
use of estimates the use of generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates 
in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
see legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report on form k for information on our judicial  regulatory and arbitration proceedings 
execution and clearing risk our execution and clearing segment  through the normal course of business  enters into various securities transactions as agent 
the execution  settlement and financing of these transactions can result in unrecorded market risk and concentration of credit risk 
our execution and clearing activities involve settlement and financing of various customer securities transactions on a cash or margin basis 
these activities may expose us to risk in the event the customer or other broker is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations and we have to purchase or sell securities at a loss 
for margin transactions  we may be exposed to significant market risk in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur in their accounts 
restructuring of our labranche structured products related subsidiaries in august  we formed lshi  as a holding company to own all our labranche structured products affiliated entities

completed senior note repurchase  release of lava escrow in connection with the sale of our interest in lava trading inc lava as part of an acquisition of lava in august  we received cash of approximately million at the closing 
additional consideration of approximately million was deposited in escrow to secure our indemnification obligations as a selling stockholder of lava until november  under the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes due and our outstanding senior notes due collectively  the outstanding senior notes  by the st day following the closing of the lava acquisition  we were required to offer to purchase outstanding senior notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the after tax proceeds of the sale of our interest in lava in august  at a price equal to of the principal amount of such outstanding senior notes 
therefore  on july   we commenced an offer to purchase outstanding senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to approximately million 
this excess proceeds offer expired on august   with  principal amount of outstanding senior notes having been tendered 
following the closing of this transaction and the closings of other previous offers to repurchase with immaterial ternders of senior notes  approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due remained outstanding and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due remained outstanding 
on october   the escrow in connection with the lava transaction was terminated and we received approximately million as additional consideration in connection with the lava transaction 
therefore  under the indenture governing the outstanding senior notes we will again be required to offer to purchase outstanding senior notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the after tax proceeds of this million on or prior to october  results of operations specialist and market making segment operating results for the years ended december  vs

key metrics of our specialist and market making activities when assessing the performance and financial results of a specific period  management examines certain metrics to ascertain their impact on cash equity specialist financial results

while these metrics are monitored by management each period  they are not the sole indicators or factors in any given period that determine our level of revenues  profitability or overall performance 
other factors  such as extreme price movements  unanticipated company news and events and other uncertainties may influence our financial performance either positively or negatively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the increase in net gain on principal transactions is attributable primarily to our options  futures and etfs specialist operations  with respect to which trading revenue increased by approximately from to this revenue growth was the result of an increase in the number of products traded  market maker professionals and exchanges on which we trade our derivative products 
this was offset by a continued decrease in our cash equity specialist operations  in which trading revenue decreased by approximately from to this decrease was at a lower rate than in  but was similarly due to a decline in principal shares traded as well as the continued decline in market volatility  as measured by the average closing price of the vix 
another factor that has reduced the opportunity for our cash equity specialists to participate is the continuing rise in program trading as a percentage of nyse average daily share volume 
program trading involves reducing large share orders into many smaller orders  resulting in the orders being matched electronically 
these factors offset the benefit from the increases in nyse average daily share volume and share volume and dollar value traded for equity securities in which we are the specialist 
we believe that market volatility has declined as the level of mutual funds participation in the market has declined 
interest revenue earned by our specialist and market making segment was higher primarily due to an increase in securities lending  known as stock borrow transactions  resulting from increased trading activity in our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making operations 
other revenue earned by our specialist and market making segment was lower primarily due to decreased proprietary trading gains

the impairment charge was related to the nyse memberships we owned each of which was valued at million at december   compared to million at december   while the impairment charge was related to an amex membership owned by our lfsi subsidiary 
we incurred a million charge in connection with the repurchase of a substantial portion of our then outstanding senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
this charge was attributable to a consent payment  which was offered to debt holders who tendered their senior notes due and senior subordinated notes due in april  and a premium for tendering these notes for purchase prior to their maturity 
our benefit for income taxes increased two fold in to approximately million 
our effective tax rate rose to in from in as a result of a non deductible goodwill impairment charge and nyse penalties of approximately million in  which almost equaled that fiscal year s book net loss 
by contrast  the non deductible goodwill impairment charge of approximately million in represented of the book net loss for this permanent difference offset almost half of s statutory tax rate of  or approximately 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  million in assets  of which million consisted of cash and short term investments  primarily in government obligations maturing within three months  cash and securities segregated under federal regulations and overnight repurchase agreements 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily with retained earnings from operations and proceeds from our debt and equity offerings 
due to the nature of the securities business and our role as a specialist  market maker and execution agent  the amount of our cash and short term investments  as well as operating cash flow  may vary considerably due to a number of factors  including the dollar value of our positions as principal  whether we are net buyers or sellers of securities  the dollar volume of executions by our customers and clearing house requirements  among others 
certain regulatory requirements constrain the use of a portion of our liquid assets for financing  investing or operating activities 
similarly  the nature of our business lines  the capital necessary to maintain current operations and our current funding needs subject our cash and cash equivalents to different requirements and uses 
as of december   the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations  without taking into account any available roll over provisions  were as follows total year years years years s omitted short term and long term debt subordinated liabilities operating lease obligations total amounts represent aggregate amount to be paid at maturity and do not include discounts of approximately million as of december  the above table includes indebtedness with primarily long term maturities  the interest and principal payments of which have a significant effect on the cash available to finance our current and future operations 
as of december   our most significant long term indebtedness was the million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may  and the million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in may at december   our net cash capital position was million 
fluctuations in net cash capital are common and are a function of variability in our total assets  balance sheet composition and total capital 
we attempt to maintain cash capital sources in excess of our aggregate longer term funding requirements ie  positive net cash capital 
over the previous months  our net cash capital has averaged above million 
millions cash capital available stockholders equity subordinated debt long term debt year other holding company liabilities total cash capital available cash capital required regulatory capital working capital illiquid assets long term investments subsidiary intercompany total cash capital required net cash capital cash capital available is mainly comprised of stockholders equity  long term debt  subordinated debt and other liabilities of our parent holding company which  in the aggregate  constitute the currency used to purchase our assets and provide our working capital 
this amount will principally be affected as debt matures or is refinanced and as earnings are retained or paid as dividends 
cash capital required mainly consists of the assets used in our businesses 
regulatory capital is defined as capital required by the sec and applicable exchanges to be maintained by broker dealers 
it is principally comprised of cash  net equities  other investments and net receivables from other broker dealers 
working capital constitutes liquid assets provided to our subsidiaries in excess of the required regulatory capital 
illiquid assets and long term investments mainly are comprised of exchange memberhips  intangible assets  such as goodwill  tradename and stock listing rights  deposits  deferred taxes and non marketable investments 
net cash capital is considered to be the excess of cash capital available over cash capital required  or free cash  which we can utilize to fund our business needs 
we also monitor alternative funding measures in addition to our available net cash 
the alternative funding measures are significant transactions and actions we could take in a short term time frame to generate cash to meet debt maturities or other business needs 
more precisely  as of decembr   we have identified the following alternative funding measures to support future debt maturity requirements liquidation of net invested capital at certain subsidiaries 
reduction of excess capital at labranche co llc to only required net liquid assets excess nla dividend proposed reduction of nla requirements by the nyse and sec 
nyse merger consideration  including  and  shares of nyse group per membership  and the  permitted dividend per membership which was declared immediately prior to the merger 
alternative funding measures millions net cash capital investment in subsidiaries excess nla dividend at llc proposed reduction of nla requireents nyse group stock nyse merger consideration total cash available from alternate funding measures computed on an after tax basis based on opening nyx price of per share on march  in addition to the alternative funding measures above  we monitor the maturity profile of our unsecured debt to minimize refinancing risk  we maintain relationships with debt investors and bank creditors  and we periodically renew our secured committed credit facilities 
strong relationships with a diverse base of creditors and debt investors are critical to our liquidity 
we also maintain available sources of short term funding that exceed actual utilization  thus allowing us to accommodate changes in investor appetite and credit capacity for our debt obligations 
with respect to the management of refinancing risk  the maturity profile of our long term debt portfolio is monitored on an ongoing basis and structured within the context of two significant debt tranches with a significant spread of years between maturities mid term and long term 
thus  we have strategically negotiated debt terms due and for the significant debt tranches 
in addition  the debt tranches have call provisions which allow pre maturity retirements as early as the debt tranches have available maturities and calls over the six year period through to allow us maximum flexibility in satisfying the debt maturities with payments and or sufficient time to refinance the long term debt as required 
the following chart profiles our long term debt maturity as of december  lab long term debt principal callable repayment schedule

senior notes tranches due rate million million excludes extendible subordinated debt of mm and mm in and respectively 
extendible debt is defined as debt instruments with an extendible maturity 
unless debt holders instruct the company to redeem their debt  the earliest maturity date of these instruments is automatically extended 
based on past experience  the majority of the company s extendibles are expected to remain outstanding beyond their earliest maturity date 
our outstanding senior notes were issued pursuant to a new indenture that is similar to the indentures that governed our senior notes due and senior subordinated notes due prior to their amendment in connection with our may debt refinancing 
the new indenture includes certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make certain investments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  create liens on our assets and sell assets or engage in mergers and consolidations  except in accordance with certain specified conditions 
in addition  our ability to incur additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  pay dividends  redeem stock or repurchase subordinated indebtedness prior to maturity is limited if our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is at or below a threshold of the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio reflects a comparison between our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  or ebitda  and the sum of our consolidated interest expense and a tax effected multiple of any dividend payments with respect to our preferred stock 
as of december   our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  was the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes provides for certain exceptions to the limitations on restricted payments  including  for example  the july repurchase of all then outstanding shares of our series b preferred stock  repurchase of our outstanding senior notes  and any restricted payments up to an aggregate of million over the life of the indenture 
in addition  under the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes  if  at any time  our cumulative restricted payments since may  generally are greater than i the sum of a of our cumulative consolidated net income  as defined in the indenture  since july  or  if such calculation is a loss  minus of such loss and b of the net cash proceeds received from any issuance or sale of our capital stock since july   plus ii million  we will not be entitled to make a restricted payment at such time 
as of december   our cumulative consolidated net income since july  was million  and we had received approximately million upon the exercise of options since july  accordingly  we currently are entitled to make restricted payments up to million  plus the million basket described above  for an aggregate total of million 
while we have not made any restricted payments since may   we cannot be sure if  when or to what extent this covenant will prevent or limit us from making restricted payments in the future 
the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes permits us to redeem some or all of the senior notes due on or after may  and some or all of the senior notes due on or after may  at varying redemption prices  depending on the date of redemption 
in addition  we have the option to redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due at a redemption price of and up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes due at a redemption price of using the proceeds of certain equity offerings which we may complete on or prior to may  under the terms of the indenture  if we sell substantially all our assets or experience specific kinds of changes in control  we will be required to offer to repurchase outstanding senior notes  on a pro rata basis  at a price in cash equal to of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
after giving effect to our may debt refinancing and the repurchase of all then outstanding shares of our series b preferred stock in july  the after tax earnings per share impact of our ongoing interest obligations with respect to our outstanding senior notes is lower than the combined after tax earnings per share impact of our interest obligations with respect to the senior notes and senior subordinated notes and our non tax deductible dividend obligations with respect to our then outstanding series b preferred stock 
to the extent we repurchase any outstanding senior notes in connection with future corporate strategic initiatives  our fixed term interest payments would be correspondingly reduced 
the remaining million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due that we did not repurchase in connection with our may debt refinancing will continue to accrue interest at a rate of per annum until they mature on march  to the extent we are not prohibited under the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes  we may seek to repurchase some or all of the remaining senior subordinated notes from time to time on the open market 
in connection with the sale of our interest in lava as part of an acquisition of lava in august  we received cash of approximately million at the closing 
additional consideration of approximately million was deposited in escrow to secure our indemnification obligations as a selling stockholder of lava until november  under the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes  by the st day following the closing of the lava acquisition  we were required to offer to purchase outstanding senior notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the after tax proceeds of the disposition of our investment in lava during the third quarter of  at a price equal to of the principal amount of such outstanding senior notes 
therefore  on july   we commenced an offer to purchase outstanding senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of up to approximately million 
this excess proceeds offer expired on august   with  principal amount having been tendered 
following the closing of this transaction and the closings of previous offers to repurchase with immaterial tenders of senior notes  approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due remained outstanding and approximately million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due remained outstanding 
on october   the escrow in connection with the lava transaction was terminated and we received approximately million as additional consideration in connection with the lava transaction 
therefore  under the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes  we will again be required to offer to purchase outstanding senior notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the after tax proceeds of this million receipt on or prior to october  as of december   we owned nyse memberships out of a total nyse memberships  representing a ownership interest in the nyse 
upon consummation of the nyse merger with archipelago on march   each nyse membership is entitled to receive in exchange for the nyse membership  in cash  plus  shares of nyse group common stock 
in addition  immediately prior to the consummation of the nyse archipelago merger  the nyse announced a permitted dividend to be paid to each nyse membership in the amount of approximately  which was equivalent to each membership s pro rata portion of the nyse s excess cash  as defined in the nyse archipelago merger agreement 
as a result of the nyse archipelago merger  therefore  our nyse memberships were converted into the right to receive an aggregate of million in cash not including the permitted dividend and  shares of nyse group common stock 
we received the permitted dividend with respect to each of the nyse memberships on march  based on information provided to us prior to the closing of the merger  we expect to receive the merger consideration on or about march  a potential source of liquidity for labranche co 
llc is the committed line of credit that it maintains with a bank 
in october  labranche co 
llc extended this million committed credit agreement to october  on the same terms and conditions 
in connection with the credit agreement  we pay a quarterly fee of of the total committed line of credit 
amounts outstanding under this credit facility would be secured by our inventory of specialist stocks and bear interest at the bank s broker loan rate 
this facility can only be used to finance inventory requirements at labranche co 
llc 
in order to maintain the availability of funds under this credit facility  we must comply with certain financial and other covenants 
as a specialist and market maker  we are required to maintain certain levels of capital and liquid assets as promulgated by various regulatory agencies which regulate our business 
as part of our overall risk management procedures for further discussion  refer to part i  item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we attempt to balance our responsibility as specialist  market maker and broker dealer with our overall capital resources 
these requirements restrict our ability to make use of cash and other liquid assets for corporate actions  such as repaying our debt  repurchasing stock or making acquisitions 
as a broker dealer  labranche co 
llc is subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers and requiring the maintenance of minimum levels of net capital  as defined in sec rule c labranche co 
llc is required to maintain minimum net capital  as defined  equivalent to the greater of  or 
of aggregate indebtedness  as defined 
nyse rule c also prohibits a broker dealer from repaying subordinated borrowings  paying cash dividends  making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which would result in a reduction of its total net capital to less than of its required minimum capital 
moreover  broker dealers are required to notify the sec prior to repaying subordinated borrowings  paying dividends and making loans to any parent  affiliates or employees  or otherwise entering into transactions which  if executed  would result in a reduction of or more of their excess net capital net capital less minimum requirement 
the sec has the ability to prohibit or restrict such transactions if the result is deemed detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker dealer 
as of december   labranche co

llc s and lsps required combined dollar amount of net liquid assets  as defined  was million 
labranche co 
llc s actual net liquid assets  as defined  was million as of december  lsps is not required to perform a net liquid assets calculation because labranche co 
llc s actual net liquid assets exceed the combined net liquid assets requirement of labranche co 
llc and lsps 
the nyse has filed a proposed rule with the sec which seeks to reduce the required net liquid ssset amounts for specialists such as labranche co 
llc 
based on the currently proposed rule  we expect a reduction in our required net liquid assets of approximately million 
this reduction is expected to be effected in four equal quarterly installments commencing on the date the sec approves the final rule 
the timing and extent of any such reduction  however  has not been finally determined  and it is possible that the rule will not be approved by the sec at all 
a reduction in labranche co 
llc s net liquid assets requirement  however  would allow funds no longer needed for net liquid assets purposes to be used for other corporate purposes 
the amex generally requires its equity specialist firms to maintain a cash or liquid asset position of the greater of a million or b an amount sufficient to assume a position of sixty trading units of each security in which the specialist is registered

failure by any of our broker dealer subsidiaries to maintain its required net capital and net liquid assets  where applicable  may subject it to suspension or revocation of its sec registration or its suspension or expulsion by the nyse  the amex and or any other exchange of which it is a member firm 
as evidenced by the foregoing requirements  our broker dealer subsidiaries require a substantial amount of capital 
in particular  labranche co 
llc s and lsps combined net liquid asset requirement of million limits our ability to utilize a substantial portion of our liquid assets for other corporate purposes 
although a portion of the combined net liquid asset requirement of million is met by labranche co 
llc s and lsps securities positions  pending trades and other assets associated with our equity and etf specialist activities  a substantial portion of labranche co 
llc s cash and cash equivalents as of december  was used to meet their combined net liquid asset requirement

llc repaid million in accordance with these terms in each of june and labranche co 
llc may prepay  at a premium  all or any part of such senior subordinated notes at any time  provided that the amount prepaid is not less than of the aggregate principal amount of such senior subordinated notes then outstanding 
upon the occurrence of a change of control  labranche co 
llc may  but is not required to  make one irrevocable separate offer to each holder of the senior subordinated notes to prepay all the senior subordinated notes then held by that holder 
the occurrence of a change of control also constitutes an event of acceleration under the senior subordinated notes 
each of the junior subordinated notes has an automatic rollover provision  which extends the maturity for an additional year  unless the lender provides at least seven months advance notice of its intention not to renew at maturity 
labranche co

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to regulatory requirements that prescribe communication barriers between our broker dealer subsidiaries  we employ different compliance risk management procedures at each such subsidiary 
these risk processes are set forth below our cash equity specialist risk management process because our equity specialist activities on the nyse and amex expose our capital to significant risks  managing these risks is a constant priority for us 
our central role in the auction process helps us to manage risks by incorporating up to date market information in the management of our inventory  subject to our specialist obligations 
we have developed a risk management process at our labranche co 
llc subsidiary that is designed to balance our ability to profit from our specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses 
this risk management process includes participation by our corporate compliance committee  executive operating committee  floor management committee  post managers  floor captains and specialists 
these parties roles are as follows corporate compliance committee 
our corporate compliance committee was established in february and consists of representatives from executive and senior management  compliance personnel  including our on floor compliance officer  our general counsel and several additional senior floor specialists  known as post managers 
the role of the corporate compliance committee is to implement  monitor and report to senior management on the statutory and regulatory compliance efforts of our specialist business 
the corporate compliance committee also advises the compliance department in establishing  reviewing and revising our policies and procedures governing labranche co 
llc s regulatory compliance structure 
executive operating committee 
our executive operating committee is composed of two executive officers 
this committee is responsible for approving all risk management procedures and trading guidelines for our specialist stocks  after receiving recommendations from our floor management committee 
in addition  our executive operating committee reviews all unusual situations reported to it by our floor management committee 
floor management committee 
our floor management committee is composed of eleven post managers  two floor managers and one swat team manager 
this committee is responsible for formulating and overseeing our overall risk management procedures and trading guidelines for each of our specialist stocks 
in determining these procedures and guidelines  the floor management committee considers the recommendations of the floor captains 
the post managers meet with their respective floor captains on a weekly basis to review and  if necessary  revise the risk management procedures and trading guidelines for particular specialist stocks 
in addition  post managers and floor managers are always available on the trading floor to review and assist with any unusual trading situations reported by a floor captain  and the swat team manager is available to assess and provide assistance on break out  or intense  trading situations 
our floor management committee reports to our executive operating committee about each of these trading situations as they occur 
floor captains 
we employ thirteen floor captains who monitor the activities of our cash equity specialists throughout the trading day from various positions at our trading posts 
the floor captains observe trades and constantly review trading activities on a real time basis 
in addition  the floor captains are readily available to assist our specialists in determining when to deviate from procedures and guidelines in reacting to any unusual situations or market conditions 
the floor captains report these unusual situations and any deviations from these procedures and guidelines to their respective post managers 
floor captains meet with each specialist at least once a week to evaluate each specialist s adherence to our risk management procedures and trading guidelines  as well as to review compliance reports generated by the compliance department in monitoring and reviewing specialist trading activities 
floor captains also meet to review risk procedures and guidelines and  if appropriate  make recommendations to the floor management committee 
specialists 
our specialists conduct auctions of our specialist stocks based upon the conditions of the marketplace 
in doing so  specialists observe our risk management procedures and trading guidelines in tandem with their responsibility to create and maintain a fair and orderly market 
specialists immediately notify a floor captain of any unusual situations or market conditions requiring a deviation from our procedures and guidelines 
on floor compliance officer 
we also have an on floor compliance officer that monitors the specialists compliance with nyse rules throughout the day on an ad hoc basis 
the on floor compliance officer reports his findings and on general on floor compliance initiatives on a daily basis to our equity specialist unit s chief compliance officer and chief executive officer and provides summary updates of these efforts to the corporate compliance committee on a monthly basis 
many of our compliance and risk management activities flow from the efforts of our on floor compliance initiative 
we believe that the enhancements we have made to our compliance procedures and guidelines in connection with the undertakings set forth in our march settlement with the sec and nyse and on a continuous basis as circumstances warrant have improved our risk management process 
our equity specialist operations on the amex are conducted by six equity specialists 
we have one post manager on the amex who monitors the trading activities of the amex equity specialists by observing trades and reviewing positions on a real time basis 
as a member of the floor management committee  the post manager regularly communicates with other members of the floor management committee regarding any deviations from our amex procedures and guidelines set by our executive operating committee 
we also have an on floor compliance officer that monitors the specialists compliance with amex rules throughout the day on an ad hoc basis 
the on floor compliance officer reports his findings and on general on floor compliance initiatives on a daily basis to our equity specialist unit s chief compliance officer and chief executive officer and provides summary updates of these efforts to the corporate compliance committee on a monthly basis 
many of our compliance and risk management activities flow from the efforts of our on floor compliance initiative 
circuit breaker rules 
the nyse and amex have instituted certain circuit breaker rules intended to halt trading in all nyse amex listed stocks in the event of a severe market decline 
the circuit breaker rules impose temporary halts in trading when the dow jones industrial average drops a certain number of points 
current circuit breaker levels are set quarterly at  and percent of the dow jones industrial average closing values of the previous month  rounded to the nearest points 
these rules provide investors extra time to respond to severe market declines and provide us an additional opportunity to assure compliance with our risk management procedures 
equity market risk we have developed a risk management process  which is intended to balance our ability to profit from our equity specialist activities with our exposure to potential losses 
we have invested substantial capital  along with the nyse  in real time  on line systems which give our management instant access to specific trading information at any time during the trading day  including our aggregate long and short positions and our capital and profit and loss information on an aggregate or per issue basis 
subject to the specialist s obligation to maintain a fair and orderly market and to applicable regulatory requirements  we constantly seek to manage our trading positions relative to existing market conditions 
a high concentration of equity specialists principal trading revenue is generated from its ten and twenty five most profitable nyse specialist stocks 
however  the percentage of our equity specialist trading revenue generated from our ten most profitable specialist stocks has decreased from to of total principal trading revenue in and  respectively 
the percentage of our equity specialist trading revenue generated from our twenty five most profitable specialist stocks has decreased from to of total principal trading revenue in and  respectively 
we are not overly reliant on a particular group of specialist stocks  as the composition of our ten and twenty five most profitable specialist stocks changes frequently 
our equity specialist trading activities are subject to a number of risks  including risks of price fluctuations  rapid changes in the liquidity of markets and foreign exchange risk related to american depositary receipts adrs 
in any period  we may incur trading losses in our specialist stocks for a variety of reasons  including price fluctuations of our specialist stocks and carrying out our specialist obligations 
from time to time  we may have large position concentrations in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry 
in general  because our inventory of securities is marked to market on a daily basis  any significant price movement in these securities could result in an immediate reduction of our revenues and operating profits 
our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making risk management process as specialists in options  etfs and futures  we have a responsibility to maintain a fair and orderly market  and trade securities as principal out of both obligation and inclination 
our options  etfs  futures  us government obligations and foreign currency specialist trading exposes us to certain risks  such as price and interest rate fluctuations  volatility risk  credit risk  foreign currency movements and changes in the liquidity of markets 
additionally  as a market maker in options  etfs and futures  we also trade as principal out of inclination 
in our market making function  we bring immediacy and liquidity to the markets when we choose to participate 
our market making activities expose us to certain risks  including  but not limited to  price fluctuations and volatility 
certain members of management who oversee our options  futures and etfs specialist and market making activities are responsible for managing these risks 
these individuals utilize a third party software application to monitor specialist and market making positions on a real time basis 
by monitoring actual and theoretical profit and loss  volatility and other standard risk measures  these individuals seek to insure that our traders operate within the parameters set by management 
our traders purchase and sell futures  options  the stocks underlying certain positions  us government securities and foreign currencies in an attempt to hedge market and foreign currency risk 
furthermore  our aggregate risk in connection with our options  futures and etfs trading is under constant evaluation by certain members of management and our traders  and all significant trading strategies and positions are closely monitored 
our options  futures and etf trading is executed on national and foreign exchanges 
these trades clear through the options clearing corporation  the national securities clearing corporation or the applicable exchange clearing organization  thereby reducing potential credit risk 
the following chart illustrates how specified movements in the underlying securities prices of the options  futures and etf s in our specialist and market making portfolios would have impacted profits and losses profit or loss if the underlying securities move s omitted portfolio as of march  june  september  december  the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating this risk  and different methodologies would produce materially different estimates 
the zero percent change column represents the profit or loss our options  futures and etfs specialist operations would experience on a daily basis if the relevant market remained unchanged 
foreign currency risk in connection with the trading of us registered shares of foreign issuers in connection with our cash equity specialist operations  we are exposed to varying degrees of foreign currency risk 
the pricing of these securities is based on the value of the ordinary securities as denominated in their local currencies 
thus  a change in a foreign currency rate relative to the us dollar will result in a change in the value of us registered shares in which we are the specialist 
our etf specialist and market makers trade international etfs that are denominated and settled in us dollars  but the pricing of these etfs is also affected by changes in the relevant foreign currency rates
