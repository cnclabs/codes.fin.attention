table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  ii the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  iii and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate and update our estimates and judgments  including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  realizability of inventories  estimated costs of warranty obligations  impairment of long lived assets  estimated obligation associated with the retirement of assets  estimated legal expenses  valuation of goodwill  valuation of identifiable intangible assets and valuation of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among other policies  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our products to the customer provided that we have received a purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no further customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
provisions for estimated sales returns and adjustments are made at the point of revenue recognition based on historical experience 
sales adjustments are charged against consolidated net sales  disputed freight charges are charged against cost of sales  and other customer accommodations are typically charged against operating expenses 
other customer accommodations represent additional costs incurred beyond the sale of the product to uphold the quality of the products sold and to maintain customer satisfaction 
consignment sales are recognized at the time that all criteria of revenue recognition described above have been satisfied by the consignee 
accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of the accounts receivable balance and we maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical bad debt experience  ongoing credit evaluations of customers and changes in our customers businesses 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to identify uncollectible receivables  and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
segment reporting we have three reportable business segments defined by geographic locations in accordance with sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas merix oregon  merix san jose and merix asia 
our operating segments are evidence of the internal structure of our organization 
each segment operates predominately in the same industry with production facilities that produce similar  customized products for our customers 
our production facilities  sales management and chief decision makers for all processes are managed by the same executive team 
foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions we translate the consolidated financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation sfas  which requires that assets  liabilities and operations of a foreign 
table of contents entity be measured using the functional currency of that entity 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the us dollar  with the exception of the foreign sales offices  which use their respective local currencies as the functional currency  and certain subsidiaries in the people s republic of china  which use the hong kong dollar as the functional currency 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
for those foreign subsidiaries whose books of record are not maintained in their respective functional currency  remeasurement into the functional currency is required before translation into the reporting currency 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated into the us dollar at weighted average exchange rates during the period 
foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the translation of foreign functional currency financial statements into us dollars are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
transactions involving a currency other than the functional currency generate a gain or loss from the fluctuation of the currency relative to the functional currency and are recorded in the statement of operations during the respective period in which they occur 
we currently do not utilize any derivative instruments to mitigate these foreign transaction gains and losses 
net foreign currency transaction losses were thousand during the fiscal year ended may  net foreign currency transaction gains and losses were insignificant for the fiscal years ended may  and may  cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short term  highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short maturities 
short term investments in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas  investments in auction rate securities are classified as available for sale short term investments 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  as determined by quoted market prices  with unrealized holding gains and losses  net of tax  classified as a separate component of shareholders equity 
upon sale of the investments  any previously unrealized holding gains or losses are recognized in the statement of operations 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold 
we review short term investments on a periodic basis to evaluate whether such securities have experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
if an other than temporary decline in value exists  an impairment charge is recorded within the statement of operations as the difference between the carrying value of the impaired investments and the net realizable value of the impaired investments 

table of contents on february   we reclassified our investments in auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments for the fiscal year and all prior periods 
corresponding adjustments to the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year were made to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities  rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents 
the change in classification does not affect cash flows from operations or from financing activities for any period previously reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows  nor does it affect net income or loss for any period previously reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
in thousands in thousands as reported as reclassified cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and cash equivalents short term investments total may  may  in thousands in thousands as reported as reclassified investments net cash used in investing activities investments net cash used in investing activities purchases maturities purchases maturities for the year ended may  inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
cost is determined by standard cost  which approximates the first in  first out fifo basis 
provisions for inventories are made to reduce excess inventories to their estimated net realizable values  as necessary 
a change in customer demand for inventory is the primary indicator for reductions in inventory carrying values 
we record inventory provisions based on historical experiences with customers  the ability to utilize inventory in other programs  the ability to redistribute inventory back to the suppliers  and current and forecasted demand for the inventory 
we sell inventory on a consignment basis in the united states and in asia 
consignment inventory is recorded as inventory until the product is pulled from the consignment inventories held by our consignment customers and all rights and rewards of ownership of the consignment inventory have transferred 
property  plant and equipment  net with the exception of property  plant and equipment acquired through a business acquisition  property  plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
property  plant and equipment acquired through a business acquisition are accounted for as a purchase initially recorded at fair value based upon the allocated purchase prices at the date of acquisition 
costs of improvements  including related interest and qualifying internal costs  are capitalized 
costs of improvements include major improvements to existing property  plant and equipment and major improvements in management information systems 
maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred  while improvements that extend the useful life of the assets are capitalized 
as property and equipment is sold or retired  the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the asset accounts and any gain or loss thereon is recorded 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets  which approximate up to years for buildings  and to years for machinery and equipment 

table of contents for merix oregon and merix san jose  leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the assets economic life or the contractual term of the lease 
optional renewal periods are included in the contractual term of the lease if renewal is reasonably assured at the time the asset is placed in service 
for merix asia  leasehold improvements are amortized over the economic useful life of ten years 
the contractual terms of some of merix asia s leases are two years with no stated options to renew the leases 
however  as it is reasonably assured that the leases will be renewed and we have intentions to operate the leased manufacturing facilities indefinitely  the tenant improvements within the leased facilities are amortized over a period longer than our current underlying contractual lease obligations 
asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  we recognize the fair value of an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement obligation is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expenses 
if the asset retirement obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  we will recognize a gain or loss upon settlement 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  our long lived assets to be held and used in the business are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we consider a trend of unsatisfactory operating results that are not in line with management s expectations to be its primary indicator of potential impairment 
when an indicator of impairment is noted  assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
if the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that the fair values are reduced for disposal costs 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to identify indicators of impairment and to estimate discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
during  we evaluated long lived assets for impairment and determined that certain long lived assets were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a thousand non cash charge to operating expense relating to the impairment of long lived assets 
the thousand impairment charge included a thousand non cash charge relating to the impairment of long lived assets held for sale see note to the consolidated financial statements and a thousand impairment charge relating to manufacturing equipment that was considered impaired 
the thousand non cash impairment charge was determined based upon a third party firm commitment to purchase the underlying facility at a price lower than our cost basis 
the thousand non cash impairment charge is representative of the impairment of an asset that is no longer being utilized by us 
there were no impairment charges recorded during the fiscal year in may  we made a decision to sell certain long lived assets of the company 
in accordance with sfas  we recorded such long lived assets as current assets held for sale 
we are currently attempting to sell a building located near our forest grove  oregon campus bundled with a parcel of land on which the building is located  and two additional parcels of land adjacent to the facility in forest grove  oregon 
in august  we recorded an impairment charge of thousand on the building in forest grove  oregon  as discussed above 
in management s opinion  the building and land for sale have net realizable values that approximate their carrying value at may  
table of contents leasehold land use rights  net leasehold land use rights  net represents amounts paid to lease land in hong kong and the people s republic of china 
amounts are paid at the beginning of the lease term and are amortized on the straight line method over the remaining period of the initial year lease term 
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather they are measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by sfas  in our impairment test of goodwill  we compare the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting entity exceeds the estimate of fair value  we calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its implied fair value 
in the impairment tests for indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over the estimate of fair value 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with sfas  as discussed above 
warranty we generally warrant our products for a period of up to twelve months from the point at which the rights and rewards of ownership of the product is transferred to the customer 
however  our merix asia facility generally honors warranty claims for a period of up to three years from the point at which the product is sold 
we record a liability for the estimated cost of the warranty upon transfer of ownership of our products to the customer 
the warranty liability is calculated based on our historical experience of expenses resulting from the warranty program for the twelve preceding months for merix oregon and merix san jose and for the preceding three year period for merix asia 
legal contingencies reserve in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  all legal contingencies  which are judged to be both probable and estimable  are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on our best estimates of the costs of resolving or disposing of the underlying claims 
we regularly monitor our estimates in light of current developments and changes in circumstances and we adjust our legal reserves accordingly 
if no particular amount is determined to constitute our best estimate of a particular legal contingency  we will disclose a range of estimates of the costs of resolving or disposing of the underlying claim and accrue for the low end of the range of costs  unless otherwise disclosed 
legal reserves are expensed in the period in which they occur 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to estimate legal contingency reserves 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
it is our policy to accrue legal fees when it is probable that we will have to defend ourself against known claims or allegations and we can reasonably estimate the amount of anticipated expense 
engineering expense expenditures for engineering of products and manufacturing processes are expensed as incurred 
accumulated other comprehensive income in accordance with sfas no 
reporting comprehensive income sfas  we record foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the translation of foreign functional currency financial statements into us dollars as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applicable to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
net income loss per share basic net income loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year 
diluted net income loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income loss by the weighted average outstanding shares  assuming conversion of all dilutive stock options and awards 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and we comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
in accordance with apb no 
 no compensation expense is recorded if stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying stock as of the date of grant 
income tax benefits  if any  related to stock option exercises are added to the recorded value of common stock 
adjustments for forfeitures are made as they occur 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb finalized sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r  which  after the securities and exchange commission sec amended the compliance dates on april   will be effective for our fiscal year beginning on may  the new standard will require us to record compensation expense for stock options using a fair value method 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we are currently evaluating sfas r and sab we estimate that the adoption of these pronouncements will result in approximately thousand of stock option expense being recorded during the first quarter of the fiscal year on may   our board of directors accelerated vesting of outstanding underwater employee stock options with exercise prices greater than per share 
approximately million options  or approximately of our total outstanding options as of may   with varying remaining vesting schedules  were subject to this acceleration and became immediately exercisable 
as a result of this acceleration  we expect to reduce the amount of compensation expense recorded due to the effects of sfas r 
we currently estimate a reduction in stock based compensation expense associated with this acceleration of approximately thousand for the fiscal year and an additional thousand in total for subsequent years 
this acceleration only relates to specific underwater options  and accordingly  is not representative of the overall impact that sfas r will have on the results of our operations  our cash flows or our liquidity upon implementation of sfas r 

table of contents results of operations results of operations information in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales are as follows for the year ended amounts in thousands percentage of consolidated net sales may  may  may  may  may  may  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses engineering selling  general and administrative amortization of identifiable intangibles severance and impairment charges total operating expenses operating income loss debt extinguishment charge interest income interest expense other expense  net income loss before taxes and minority interests income tax expense income loss before minority interests minority interests in net income of consolidated subsidiaries  net of tax net income loss note refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for disaggregated financial information relating to our operating segments 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years and net sales consolidated net sales were million during the fiscal year  an increase of over consolidated net sales of million during the fiscal year the increase was due primarily to the inclusion of merix asia sales of million during the fiscal year and incremental sales of approximately million resulting from merix san jose being included in the results of operations for a full year during the fiscal year as compared to approximately six months during the fiscal year the remaining increase in sales is a result of increased demand for both volume and quick turn services business at merix oregon 
unit shipments at merix oregon were higher during the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year 
table of contents unit shipments are defined as the number of panel layers included within a circuit board 
the increase in unit shipments is due to the addition of new customers  increased business from existing customers as an overall market demand increase during the fiscal year  and increased layer count resulting from higher technology 
average pricing at merix oregon decreased by approximately during the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year the decrease in average pricing during the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year was due to decreased average pricing for full lead time  volume and quick turn services orders 
sales attributed to our five largest oem customers  which vary from year to year  comprised   and of the company s consolidated net sales during the fiscal years  and  respectively 
net consolidated sales to one oem customer individually represented of consolidated net sales during the fiscal year comparatively  net consolidated sales to two oem customers individually represented and of consolidated net sales during the fiscal year and and of consolidated net sales during the fiscal year we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future 
the loss of or decrease in orders from one or more major customers could materially reduce our sales 
see discussion surrounding our significant customers within item business markets and customers 
sales attributed to oems include sales made through their electronic manufacturing service providers 
the percentage of our consolidated net sales made through electronic manufacturing service providers was approximately and during the fiscal years and  respectively  and we expect these sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales 
although our contractual relationship is with the electronic manufacturing service provider  most of our shipments to electronic manufacturing service providers are directed by oems that negotiate product pricing and volumes directly with us 
in addition  we are on the approved vendor list of several electronic manufacturing service providers and are awarded discretionary orders directly from some of them 
at the request of a number of significant customers  we have implemented consigned inventory programs 
in these programs  we produce and ship products to the customer  but retain ownership until the customer elects to take delivery 
generally  the customer commits to accept delivery within a specified period of time  typically to weeks  but is not committed to take delivery at any particular time within that period 
we record a sale only after the customer accepts delivery 
these programs have reduced our ability to accurately forecast sales on a period to period basis and have also had a negative impact on our compressed lead time volume sales 
additionally  the programs have increased our levels of finished goods inventory 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of consolidated net sales was and for the fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit is primarily due to increased sales volume due to stronger market demand during the fiscal year  which resulted in increased utilization of production capacity 
higher utilization of capacity increases gross margin because it results in a lower cost per unit produced 
the increase in gross profit was offset by purchase accounting adjustments of million at merix asia  employee incentive compensation of million and the effect of the decrease in average pricing at merix oregon 
engineering engineering expenses were million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may  the slight decrease in engineering expense in absolute dollars is due to the following a reduction in headcount causing a decrease of approximately thousand in related labor expenses  a thousand increase in engineering expenses as a result of acquiring merix asia in fiscal  and a thousand increase in engineering expenses due to the acquisition of merix san jose in december 
table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to million  or of consolidated net sales  during the fiscal year ended may  the increase in the amount of expense is largely attributed to the addition of million of expenses from as a result of acquiring merix asia during the fiscal year  as well as incremental expenses of approximately million due to the inclusion of a full fiscal year of expense included in the results of merix san jose during the fiscal year in addition  labor expenses increased in merix oregon by approximately million and sales commissions paid by merix oregon increased by million during the fiscal year due to increased sales levels 
the fiscal year also included restructuring charges of million as a result of actions taken during the first fiscal quarter 
these charges were offset by thousand of expenses related to the abandonment of a business opportunity in asia in fiscal amortization of identifiable intangibles amortization of identifiable intangibles was million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may   as compared to million  or of consolidated net sales during the fiscal year ended may  the increase is due primarily to the inclusion of a full fiscal year of amortization relating to the merix san jose intangibles in fiscal compared to a half year during the fiscal year  which resulted in increased amortization of million 
the increase is also due to thousand in amortization included in merix asia s results for fiscal severance and impairment charges severance and impairment charges were million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may  during the first quarter of the fiscal year  we executed cost reduction actions that included a reduction in approximately employee positions across our manufacturing and support organizations  predominantly in oregon 
we recorded a charge of thousand related to severance costs and thousand related to the impairment of certain fixed assets 
debt extinguishment charge we recorded a debt extinguishment charge of million  or of consolidated net sales  during the fiscal year ended may  related to the early redemption of our million convertible debenture due may and the prepayment of our million asia term loan and the prepayment of our million asia revolving loan 
interest income interest income decreased to million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may  from to million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may  due to the reduction in available cash for investing used to fund the merix asia acquisition  largely offset by higher yields on invested balances due to higher interest rates 
interest expense interest expense increased significantly to million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may  from to million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may  due to additional debt entered into to finance the merix asia acquisition 
other expense  net other expense  net increased to million  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may  from to thousand  or of consolidated net sales  for the fiscal year ended may  due primarily to net foreign currency transaction losses of thousand incurred by merix asia 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was thousand during the fiscal year and thousand during the fiscal year during the fiscal year  our book income before income taxes of million consisted of million of pre tax income in the united states and million of foreign pre tax loss 
the income tax expense 
table of contents of thousand during the fiscal year was primarily the result of our mix of profits losses earned in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  largely offset by a release of a valuation allowance reserved against deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards in several tax jurisdictions  credit carryovers and cumulative timing differences between book and tax income 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when evidence suggests that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets based on our assessment of all evidence  including the existence of cumulative losses 
the provision for income taxes for is equivalent to a effective tax rate and differs from tax computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  federal alternative minimum tax and minimum taxes in certain tax jurisdictions 
we will provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries if foreign subsidiaries have positive taxable earnings and they are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
we indefinitely reinvests the cumulative undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries 
at may   the cumulative earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries was a taxable deficit 
there were no dividends from foreign subsidiaries during therefore  no us income tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries was provided 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years and net sales consolidated net sales were million in fiscal  an increase of over consolidated net sales of million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in unit shipments partially offset by a decrease in average pricing 
fiscal year included million of revenue generated by merix san jose from the date of the merix san jose acquisition through may  unit shipments were higher during the fiscal year than the fiscal year the increase in unit shipments is due to the addition of new customers  increased business from existing customers and the acquisition of merix san jose 
average pricing decreased by approximately during the fiscal as compared to the fiscal year the decrease in average pricing during the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year was due to pricing pressures within the industry as well as a reduction in quick turn services and premium revenues as a percent of consolidated net sales 
consolidated net sales of quick turn services and premium revenues products that typically command a higher average sales price than standard volume orders as a result of rapid prototype manufacturing or compressed lead time volume orders  comprised approximately of consolidated net sales during the fiscal year as compared to approximately during the fiscal year while consolidated net sales of quick turn services and premium revenues consisted principally of compressed lead time volume orders in fiscal  consolidated net sales of these services in fiscal consisted of a relatively higher mix of quick turn services prototype orders 
the increase in the level of quick turn services prototype orders is primarily the result of our focus to grow this business and the acquisition of merix san jose 
sales attributed to our five largest original equipment manufacturer oem customers comprised and of consolidated net sales during the fiscal years and  respectively 
two oem customers individually represented and of consolidated net sales during the fiscal year ended may  and and of consolidated net sales during the fiscal year ended may  we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future 
sales attributed to oems include sales made through their electronic manufacturing service providers 
the percentage of our consolidated net sales made through electronic manufacturing service providers was approximately and during the fiscal years and  respectively  and we expect these sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales
