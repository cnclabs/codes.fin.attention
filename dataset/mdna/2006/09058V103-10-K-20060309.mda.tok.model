item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this annual report on form k contains certain statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future financial performance of biocryst 
such statements are only predictions and the actual events or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those discussed in other filings made by biocryst with the securities and exchange commission 
this discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with item  business and the financial statements  including the notes thereto  contained in item of this form k 
overview since our inception in  we have been engaged in research and development activities and organizational efforts  including identifying and licensing enzyme targets  drug discovery  structure based design of drug candidates  small scale synthesis of compounds  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  establishing collaborative relationships with third parties for contract research related to the development of our drug candidates to support manufacturing  clinical development and regulatory compliance  establishing collaborative relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties for the further development and potential commercialization of our compounds  recruiting our scientific and management personnel  establishing laboratory facilities  and raising capital 
our revenues have generally been limited to license fees  milestone payments  research and development fees  and interest income 
revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
and emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf issue 
license fees  milestone payments  and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement 
fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed 
for example  in the roche and mundipharma licenses agreements  we have determined to defer the upfront payments over the remaining life of the patents which are years and years  respectively 
in the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting in accordance with eitf issue revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestone events if the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are non refundable and non creditable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
significant direct costs incurred upon entering into a licensing arrangement are deferred and charged to expense in proportion to the revenue recognized 
under the guidance of emerging issues task force issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf issue  and emerging issues task force issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses eitf issue  reimbursements received for direct out of pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses 
royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
if royalties can not be reasonably estimated  revenue is recognized upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensee 
we have not received any royalties from the sale of licensed pharmaceutical products 
it could be several years  if ever  before we will recognize significant revenue from royalties received pursuant to our license agreements or revenue directly from product sales 
future revenues  if any  are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
our accumulated deficit at december  was million 
we expect to incur substantial expenditures relating to the development of our current and future drug candidates 
during the three years ended december   we spent of our research and development expenses on contract research and development  including payments to consultants  funding of research at academic institutions  toxicology studies on existing and potential drugs  manufacturing of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  large scale synthesis and formulation of compounds  preclinical studies  engaging investigators to conduct clinical trials  hiring contract research organizations for regulatory and clinical functions  and using statisticians to evaluate the results of clinical trials 
the above expenditures for contract research and development for our current and future drug candidates will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the status of our research and development projects 
for example  during the third quarter of  we initiated a phase i trial in healthy volunteers for our lead drug candidate  fodosine  an inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase pnp 
results from this trial will be used to assist in facilitating the design of a proposed phase iib pivotal clinical program in patients with t cell leukemia  using a combination of intravenous and oral formulations of fodosine 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we initiated a phase ii clinical trial of fodosine in patients with advanced  fludarabine refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll and in the fourth quarter of we announced the initiation of a phase i ii clinical trial of fodosine in patients with b cell all 
as these trials progress and additional trials are started in other indications  our costs for clinical studies will increase significantly 
in addition  the costs associated with the manufacturing of fodosine  peramivir and bcx will increase as we scale up to the larger production runs required for both clinical development and additional toxicology studies required for each of these programs 
changes in our existing and future research and development and collaborative relationships also will impact the status of our research and development projects 
for example  in november we entered into a license agreement with roche for the worldwide development and commercialization for our second pnp inhibitor  bcx in addition to an upfront payment plus an advance payment for some manufacturing we will perform  roche will take over the development and pay all costs associated with this program 
in february  we licensed fodosine to mundipharma for the development and commercialization of this drug in europe  asia and australasia 
in addition to the upfront payment of million  mundipharma will pay of the clinical development costs we will incur for fodosine on existing and planned clinical trials  but their portion shall not exceed million 
although we may  in some cases  be able to control the timing of development expenses  in part by accelerating or decelerating certain of these costs  many of these costs will be incurred irrespective of whether we are able to discover drug candidates or obtain collaborative partners for commercialization 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
if we fail to meet the research  clinical and financial expectations of securities analysts and investors  it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenue was  for the year compared to  for due to completion of work performed under the nih grant for hepatitis c during also  there was an nih grant during for our tf fviia program that totaled approximately  which was completed in research and development expenses for were  a increase from expenses of  which is directly related to the additional contract research  clinical trial and toxicology expenses required for the further development of our lead drug candidates during and an increase in personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses for were  an increase of over the expense of  primarily due to an increase in legal fees related to our recently announced partnerships and an increase in personnel related expenses 
interest income for was  a increase compared to  in this increase was due to a higher average cash balance during and a more favorable interest rate environment as compared to the net loss for the year ended december  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share in year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenues decreased in to  compared to  in  primarily due to a payment in from dimensional pharmaceuticals inc dp  a wholly owned subsidiary of johnson johnson  for certain rights related to complement system inhibitors discovered during the term of our collaborative research agreement 
our revenue was entirely related to grants from the nih for support of our hcv and tf fviia programs  while for our revenue included only  from the nih 
research and development expenses increased to  for from  in the increase in expenses during was directly related to contract and clinical costs associated with the development of both of our lead drug candidates during these costs primarily consisted of manufacturing  toxicology  clinical development and regulatory affairs charges  which were essential to the continuing development of these programs 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in  primarily due to an increase in consulting and professional fees related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and for the strategic development of our lead drug candidate 
interest income for was  a decrease compared to  in this decrease was due to a lower interest rate environment in the net loss for the year ended december  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share in liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since our inception 
our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity and debt securities 
for example  during february  we raised million approximately million net of expenses through the sale of  shares of our common stock and during december  we raised million approximately million net of expenses through a sale of  shares of our common stock 
other sources of funding have included the following equipment lease financing  facility leases  collaborative and other research and development agreements such as the roche and mundipharma licenses  research grants  and interest income 
in addition  we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development and using consultants 
we expect to incur additional expenses  potentially resulting in significant losses  as we continue to pursue our research and development activities  undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of compounds which have been or may be discovered and as we increase the manufacturing of our compounds for clinical trials and toxicology studies 
we also expect to incur substantial expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical products advance through later stages of development 
we invest our excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
these investments are generally not collateralized and mature within three years 
we have not realized any losses from such investments 
in addition  at december   approximately million was invested in the merrill lynch premier institutional fund  a money market mutual fund that invests in near cash securities with weighted average maturities of less than days 
the merrill lynch premier institutional fund is not insured 
we have financed some of our equipment purchases with lease lines of credit 
in july  we renegotiated our lease for our current facilities  which will expire on june  we have an option to renew the lease for an additional five years at the current market rate in effect on june  and a one time option to terminate the lease on june  for a termination fee of approximately  the lease  as amended effective december  for a reduction of  square feet  requires us to pay monthly rent starting at  per month in december and escalating annually to a minimum of  per month in the final year  plus our pro rata share of operating expenses and real estate taxes in excess of base year amounts 
as part of the lease  we have deposited a us treasury security in escrow for the payment of rent and performance of other obligations specified in the lease 
this pledged amount is currently  which can be decreased by  annually throughout the term of the lease 
currently  we have approximately  square feet being subleased  which can be terminated with days written notice 
we have not incurred any significant charges related to new equipment or building renovations since and currently have no plans for any significant renovations  but our purchases of additional equipment during could exceed million 
at december   we had long term operating lease obligations  which provide for aggregate minimum payments of  in   in and  in these obligations include the future rental of our operating facility 
we plan to finance our needs principally from the following our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital  payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners  and lease or loan financing and future public or private financing 
we believe that our currently available funds will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through however  this is a forward looking statement  and there may be changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including the progress and magnitude of our research  drug discovery and development programs  changes in existing collaborative relationships  our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships with academic institutions  biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties  the extent to which our collaborators  including governmental agencies will share in the costs associated with the development of our programs or run the development programs themselves  our ability to negotiate favorable development and marketing strategic alliances for our drug candidates  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify drug candidates  the scope of manufacturing of our drug candidates to support our preclinical research and clinical trials  the scope of validation for the manufacturing of our drug substance and drug products required for future nda filings  competitive and technological advances  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  our dependence on others for development and commercialization of our product candidates  and successful commercialization of our products consistent with our licensing strategy 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily from sale of our equity securities and  to a lesser extent  revenues from collaborations and interest 
in  our operations consumed approximately million per month 
our initial projection for is that our average burn rate for will be approximately million per month 
we expect that our monthly cash used by operations will continue to increase for the next couple of years as our clinical programs are expanded 
we are planning to be in a phase iib pivotal trial with fodosine in in t cell leukemia and are in the early stages of clinical trials in several other indications with fodosine 
as these trials increase in size and patient enrollment increases  our costs will increase 
in addition  we expect our neuraminidase inhibitor  peramivir  to be in clinical trials in the first quarter of and our hcv drug candidate  bcx to be in clinical trials during these additional trials and the related manufacturing  personnel resources and testing required to support these studies will consume significant capital resources and will increase our expenses and our net loss 
this monthly burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors  including our ability to raise additional capital  the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates  the amount of funding or assistance we receive from governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our drug candidates in general and for peramivir specifically  the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for fodosine  peramivir and bcx  the progress made in the manufacturing of our products and the progression of our other programs 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and securities 
this includes approximately million raised in december through a sale of equity  which provided additional resources to continue the development of our existing programs  while prudently maintaining our cash position 
in addition  we established a collaborative relationship with roche in november and a collaborative relationship with mundipharma in february  which provided additional cash in  net of third party license fees  totaling approximately million 
the collaboration with roche for the worldwide development and commercialization of bcx provided an upfront payment plus an advance payment for specific manufacturing we will perform 
this initial million was recorded as a receivable on our balance sheet at december  and was received in january roche will take over the development and pay all costs associated with this program 
the agreement also provides for future event payments and royalties to be made by roche upon the achievement of certain clinical  regulatory and sales events 
in february  we licensed fodosine to mundipharma for the development and commercialization of this drug in europe  asia and australasia 
in addition to the upfront payment of million  mundipharma will pay of the clinical development costs we will incur for fodosine on existing and planned clinical trials  but their portion shall not exceed million 
in addition  mundipharma will conduct additional clinical trials at their own cost up to a maximum of million 
the agreement also provides for future event payments and royalties to be made by mundipharma upon the achievement of certain clinical  regulatory and sales events 
due to the nature of the potential milestones in our collaborations  it is difficult to predict if and when particular milestones will be achieved by us or our collaborators 
however  we hope to reach at least one milestone in each of the collaborations during  which would provide additional cash upon the achievement of the specific milestone reached 
all future event payments are non refundable under our current collaborations  net of sublicense payments  and would be fully available to offset our projected burn rate 
we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe or off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on biocryst s balance sheet under gaap total purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  manufacturing and research operations and other significant purchase commitments 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future sublicense payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which were utilized in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included later in this form k  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements

royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
if royalties can not be reasonably estimated  revenue is recognized upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensee 
research and development expenses major components of r d expenses consist of personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  manufacturing costs  clinical  regulatory  and toxicology services performed by contract research organizations cro s  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs 
we charge these costs to expense when incurred  consistent with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
these costs are a significant component of r d expenses 
most of our manufacturing and our clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party cro s 
we accrue costs for studies performed by cro s over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of services actually performed by the cro 
we expense both our internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our drug candidates 
additionally  we have license agreements with third parties  such as aecom irl that require maintenance fees or fees related to sublicense agreements 
these fees are generally expensed as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred in which case the expenses will be deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimate at any particular balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under accounting principles board opinion no

r  which is a revision of statement no 
 supersedes apb no 
 and amends statement no 
generally  the approach in statement no 
r is similar to the approach described in statement no 
however  statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
we invest excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided
