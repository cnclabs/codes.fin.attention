you should review the risk factors in item a of part i of this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products in the field of dermatology 
our strategy is to develop a portfolio of innovative products that address major medical needs in the treatment of dermatological diseases and disorders 
we currently market two pharmaceutical products in the united states  vusion miconazole nitrate  zinc oxide  and white petrolatum ointment and solag mequinol and tretinoin topical solution 
we also market our solag product in canada  along with vaniqa elflornithine hci cream  for which we are the exclusive distributor in canada 
in the united states  we promote our marketed products through a sales force consisting of our own sales representatives and those of a contract sales organization 
in  we plan on increasing our sales and marketing expenses significantly  including expenses related to a planned increase from to us sales representatives and the launch of vusion 
we have one new drug application under review by the fda for our sebazole product candidate 
we have six other product candidates in phases and clinical development for the treatment of a range of dermatological conditions  including acne  psoriasis  congenital ichthyosis  onychomycosis and fungal infections 
in addition  we have access to the classes of compounds claimed in the patents licensed to us under our license agreements with affiliates of johnson johnson 
we are currently conducting a screening program to search for new product candidates in the field of dermatology 
in  we recognized product revenues of  for our sales of solag in the united states and canada and sales of vaniqa in canada 
we expect product revenues to increase in  primarily due to the launch of vusion early in the second quarter and anticipated growth in sales of solag and vaniqa 
in  we transitioned from a company primarily focused on research and development to a company also with a significant commercial focus 
as a result  we no longer consider ourselves a development stage enterprise 
we have financed our operations and internal growth almost entirely through proceeds from private placements of preferred stock  our initial public offering in the second quarter of and our follow on public offering in the first quarter of we were incorporated in september and commenced active operations in may since our inception we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we plan to continue to invest in research and clinical development studies to develop our product candidates and screen for new product candidates 
we also plan to seek marketing approvals for our products in various countries throughout the world  particularly in the united states  canada and europe 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the commercial development of our products  including the sales and marketing of vusion and solag 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of development stage or approved products that would fit within our growth strategy 
accordingly  we will need to generate significantly greater revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
research and clinical development expenses represent cost incurred for the conduct of our clinical trials  cost incurred in screening and pre clinical testing of our product candidates  manufacturing development costs related to our clinical product candidates  personnel and related costs related to our research and product development activities  and outside professional fees related to clinical development and regulatory matters 

table of contents we outsource the conduct of our clinical trials and all of our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
we expense these research and development costs as they are incurred 
we expect that our research and development expenses will be somewhat lower in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related personnel  marketing and promotion  general corporate activities  professional fees and facilities 
we expect these costs to increase in  as we continue to expand our sales organization and launch vusion 
in addition  if we were to acquire or in license other products  or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate sebazole  we would then incur sales and marketing costs related to such products 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over the next several years as we continue our clinical development  apply for regulatory approvals  enter into arrangements with third parties for manufacturing and distribution services and market our products 
we have a limited history of operations and anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate for several reasons  including the timing and extent of recognition of product and other revenue  the timing of any contract  license fee or royalty payments that we may receive or be required to make  the timing and outcome of our applications for regulatory approvals  the timing and extent of marketing and selling expenses  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  the timing and extent of our adding new employees and infrastructure  and the timing and extent of employee stock grants and stock option grants 
recent developments on february   the fda issued an approval letter for vusion for the treatment of diaper dermatitis complicated by candidiasis in infants 
our existing sales force has begun to actively promote the product to pediatricians and other targeted physicians 
we have also begun implementing our plan to expand to sales territories and expect to begin shipping product to the trade in the second quarter of results of operations years ended december   and net revenue 
net revenues are summarized below year ended december  in thousands net product revenue us international total net product revenue grant revenue contract revenue total net revenue total net revenue for increased million over  mostly related to the initial product revenue from sales of solag and increased grant revenue from the belgium government 
total revenue for increased  over  
table of contents mostly related to an increase in grant revenue from the belgium government and revenue from contract milestones recognized in net product revenues 
in  we recognized product revenues of  for our sales of solag in the united states and canada and sales of vaniqa in canada 
we expect product revenues for these two products will increase and we expect a substantial increase in total product revenues due to the launch of vusion 
prior to  we had no product revenue 
other revenues 
in  we recorded grant revenue from a belgian governmental agency promoting technology in the flemish region of belgium through a research grant of million compared to  for the previous year 
we recognized grant revenue of  for the year ended december  in addition  during  we recognized revenue related to commercial contracts of  an increase from the  we recognized during the belgium grant under which we receive revenue over the past three years has been completed 
additional future grants have been applied for  however  to date we have no new agreements in place 
cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenue totaled  for the year ended december  this amount includes finished product costs  distribution expense related to product sales  including one time start up distribution expenses  and amortization of solag product rights 
we did not report cost of product revenues during or because we did not have product sales 
in the first quarter of  we acquired the united states and canadian rights to solag  and are amortizing the remaining intangible asset over the expected life 
amortization expense related to the product rights for the acquisition of solag was  for we expect that our gross margin will fluctuate as we increase our product sales of solag and vaniqa and begin to sell vusion and other products  if and when they are approved 
research and development expenses 
total research and development expenses for compared to decreased by  expenses related to our late stage candidates decreased million from to as phase trials concluded for sebazole in and hyphanox during research and development expenses increased million from to primarily due to increases related to hyphanox studies  other clinical stage products and internal costs 
below is a summary of our research and development expenses year ended december of of of in thousands total total total sebazole hyphanox vusion liarozole other clinical stage products research and preclinical stage products costs internal costs total research and development expenses in the preceding table  research and development expenses are set forth in the following seven categories sebazole sebazole expenses for related primarily to the completion of our long term safety study which commenced in the third quarter of  as well as regulatory and manufacturing costs related to the development of this product 
during  our research and development costs related to sebazole were up  or  over we conducted two phase clinical trials in the united states and europe in  compared with a confirmatory phase clinical trial for sebazole and a long term safety study in hyphanox our costs for hyphanox for are related to the completion of a phase pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis  supportive pharmacokinetics studies  and set up costs for a phase clinical trial 
table of contents for the treatment of onychomycosis 
the costs are million  or  lower than  because the phase trial ran for only six months of compared to twelve months of manufacturing development costs in were also lower for hyphanox compared with our costs for for hyphanox were primarily for the purchase of raw materials and related manufacturing  as well as the costs of conducting pilot bioequivalence studies 
vusion our costs related to vusion for increased  compared to primarily due to increased costs for manufacturing development and regulatory costs 
in  we incurred costs related to validation batches as well as a contract minimum payment made to our contract manufacturer 
costs for the year ended december  increased slightly due to the cost of our phase pivotal clinical trial  which began enrolling patients in the first half of and was completed during the third quarter of  and the costs incurred in connection with the preparation of regulatory filings and filing fees in the united states and europe 
liarozole our costs for liarozole in were marginally higher than our costs in our costs in are related to the set up costs for our phase trial for the treatment of lamellar ichthyosis as well as costs for clinical supplies and manufacturing of the active ingredient 
our costs for liarozole in related to the cost of the review of clinical data and the manufacturing of both active ingredient and clinical supplies 
the liarazole costs related primarily to the manufacturing of drug substance for clinical supplies 
other clinical stage product candidates other clinical stage product costs for increased million compared to primarily due to higher direct program costs on rambazole and azoline 
increased spending on these product candidates was also the primary driver for the cost increase of million from to spending on rambazole for was related to manufacturing development  pre clinical studies  and preparation and set up of our phase b study 
spending on azoline during was related to manufacturing development  pre clinical studies  and preparation and set up of our phase b study 
research and preclinical stage product costs direct expenses relating to the development of our research and preclinical product candidates and the screening of molecules to identify new product candidates 
internal costs internal costs for increased million compared to personnel and related costs totaled million for  an increase of  over the corresponding period in this increase is primarily due to an increase in personnel  partially offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred compensation of  other costs  which include consultants  overhead and other expenses  totaled million  an increase of  compared to the corresponding period in internal costs for increased million compared to personnel and related costs totaled million for  an increase of million over the corresponding period in this increase is primarily due to an increase in headcount and includes amortization of deferred compensation of  which was  for other costs  which include consultants  overhead and other expenses  totaled million  an increase of million compared to the corresponding period in we anticipate that research and development expenses will remain at current levels in the near term and could increase as we further advance our late stage product candidates through clinical development 
in addition  we will begin to incur additional expenses for our mid stage pipeline as we move toward larger and more expensive phase and phase trials and devote additional resources to our earlier stage research and preclinical projects 
we also expect our personnel and related expenses for research and development to increase 
selling general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for totaled million  an increase of million over this increase was largely the result of our establishment of commercial operations in sales force costs for represented million of this increase resulting from the creation of our territory sales team in the united states and four person sales team in canada 
marketing expenses increased million  primarily related to the preparation for the launch of vusion and launch and promotion of solag 
we also increased spending on our commercial infrastructure by million over this increase includes commercial management  supply chain expenses and support staff 
corporate administrative expenses also increased million from and included higher personnel  consulting  overhead and other expenses to support our growing public company 
selling  general and administrative expense for totaled million  up million over marketing and commercial infrastructure expenses increased million 
this increase was primarily attributable to the build up of our 
table of contents commercial infrastructure and the pre launch marketing and market research expenses for vusion 
we recorded no sales and marketing expenses in corporate administrative expenses totaled million for  an increase of million over the corresponding period in this increase is primarily due to an increase in headcount and includes amortization of deferred compensation of  in  which was  for we expect sales force and marketing costs will continue to increase as we grow the sales force and support the launch of vusion and potentially sebazole  if approved 
if we were to acquire additional products or in license products these costs would also increase 
we expect corporate administrative costs to continue to increase as required to support the growth of the company 
interest income  net of interest expense 
interest income  net of expense  totaled million for  an increase of million as compared to the corresponding period in this increase was primarily due to our higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities from our initial public offering and follow on offering in compared to the period and higher average interest rates 
interest income  net of expense totaled million for  an increase of  as compared to the corresponding period in these increases were primarily due to our higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities obtained from our initial public offering in april income taxes 
the income tax benefit of  in was up  from income tax benefit in was  up  over income tax benefits in all three years represent the net proceeds from the sale of a portion of unused prior years new jersey state net operating loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
since our inception  we have funded our operations principally from issuances of our convertible preferred stock  the proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock and our follow on public offering of common stock 
we raised net proceeds of approximately million from our follow on public offering in february  million from our initial public offering in may  and we have issued preferred stock  including notes converted into preferred stock  for aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million 
all of the preferred stock that we issued converted to common stock in connection with our initial public offering 
in september  the company entered into an equipment and furniture financing arrangement with a third party for up to  which was increased to  in  with an interest rate of  plus the three year treasury constant maturities rate at the time of funding 
each time it receives funding  the company will enter into a promissory note with a term of years  secured by the related equipment and furniture 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and net working capital of million 
cash flows 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million at december  our major uses of cash in include million of cash used in operations  mostly related to research and development spending and the start up of commercial operations 
cash used in operations for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase was attributable to the increased operating loss and working capital requirements to fund our operations 
cash provided by investing activities for year ended december  was million 
this is primarily attributable to million of net proceeds from marketable securities offset by million used for the acquisition of solag 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
our investing activities reflect investments in marketable securities and purchases of fixed assets necessary for operations 
we plan to continue utilizing third parties to manufacture our products and to conduct laboratory based research 
therefore  we do not expect to make significant capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which included our follow on offering net proceeds of million 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million  which included the net proceeds from our initial public offering of million 
cash 
table of contents provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million primarily related from our receipt of million in may upon the second closing of the series b convertible preferred stock financing and million in october upon closing of the series c convertible preferred stock financing 
we expect that our existing cash at december  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we currently have no additional commitments or arrangements for any additional financing to fund the commercialization of our marketed products and the research  development and commercial launch of our product candidates 
we will require additional funding in order to continue our commercialization efforts and our research and development programs  including preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  pursue the commercial launch of our product candidates  expand our sales and marketing capabilities and for general corporate purposes 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the success of our development and commercialization of our product candidates  the scope and results of our clinical trials  advancement of other product candidates into clinical development  potential acquisition or in licensing of other products or technologies  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of manufacturing activities  and the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution and related working capital needs 
the following table summarizes our material contractual commitments as of december  one to three to less than one three five after five contractual obligation total year years years years notes payable operating lease obligations other contractual obligations a total a the other contractual obligations reflected in the table include obligations to purchase product and product candidate materials contingent on the delivery of the materials and to fund various clinical trials contingent on the performance of services 
these obligations also include long term obligations  including milestone payments that may arise under agreements that we may terminate prior to the milestone payments being due 
the table excludes contingent royalty payments that we may be obligated to pay in the future 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition we use revenue recognition criteria in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf and statement of financial accounting standards no fas revenue recognition when right of return exists 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables  are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
net product revenue 
in the united states and canada  we sell our products primarily to wholesalers and distributors  who  in turn  sell to pharmacies 
although product revenue to date has been insignificant  the following are the company s policies 
at the time of a new product launch  we utilize a pull through sales method that recognizes revenue based on estimated prescription demand based on third party market research data and revenue for a normal level of wholesaler inventory based on our estimated current prescription demand 
estimating the amount of returns and discounts for new products is based in specific facts and circumstances including acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics 
at the time of a new product launch  absent the ability to make reliable estimates we defer revenue on sales to wholesalers until we can make reliable estimates of these returns  discounts and related end user demand 
we attempt to monitor our inventory levels at our wholesalers and pharmacies to ensure these levels remain within normal levels 
we estimate inventory at wholesalers based on historical sales to wholesalers  inventory data provided to us by these wholesalers and from third party market research data related to prescription trends and patient demand 
making these determinations involves estimating whether trends in past buying patterns will predict future product sales 
we record allowances for product returns  coupon rebates and other discounts at the time of sale  and report revenue net of such amounts 
in determining allowances for product returns and rebates  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
for example  in determining these amounts  we estimate prescription demand and the levels of inventory held by wholesalers 
making these determinations involves estimating whether trends in past buying patterns will predict future product sales 
the nature of our allowances requiring critical accounting estimates  and the specific considerations we use in estimating their amounts  are as follows product returns 
our customers have the right to return any unopened product during the month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending months after the labeled expiration date 
as a result  in calculating the allowance for product returns  we must estimate the likelihood that product sold to wholesalers and pharmacies might remain in their inventory to within six months of expiration and analyze the likelihood that such product will be returned within months after expiration 
in estimating the likelihood of product remaining in our wholesalers inventory  we rely on information from our wholesalers regarding their inventory levels  measured prescription demand as reported by third party sources and on internal sales data 
we believe the information from our wholesalers and third party sources is directionally reliable  but we are unable to verify the accuracy of such data independently 
we also consider our wholesalers past buying patterns  estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped and the expiration dates of product currently being shipped 
in estimating the likelihood of product return  we rely primarily on historic patterns of returns and estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped 
at december   our allowance for returns was  discounts and rebates 
we sell solag primarily to wholesalers and distributors  who in turn sell to pharmacies 
from time to time we offer patients a limited time coupon discount on their purchases of solag 
we provide a mail in rebate coupon to the patient with a proof of purchase of solag 

table of contents as a result of these rebate offers  at the time of product shipment  we must estimate the likelihood that solag sold to wholesalers and pharmacies might be ultimately sold to a patient who redeems a coupon 
we base our estimates on the historic coupon redemption rates for similar products we receive from third party administrators  which detail historic patterns 
at december   our allowance for coupon redemptions was  we will adjust our allowances for product returns and coupon rebates based on our actual sales experience  and we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
we continually monitor our allowances and make adjustments when we believe actual experience may differ from our estimates 
international distribution partners 
under our agreements with international distribution partners  we plan to sell our product to our distribution partners at a contractual price 
these partners generally have no rights of return after they have accepted shipment of the product 
other revenue 
contract revenues include license fees  royalties and other payments associated with collaborations with third parties 
revenue is generally recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from non refundable  upfront license fees where we have a continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the performance period 
royalties from licensees are based on third party sales of licensed products and are recorded in accordance with contract terms when third party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates of the performance period and revise our assumptions as appropriate 
these changes in assumptions may affect the amount of revenue recorded in our financial statements in future periods 
grant revenues are recognized as the company provides the services stipulated in the underlying grant based on the time and materials incurred 
amounts received in advance of services provided are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized as revenue when the services are provided 
stock based compensation stock based compensation charges represent the difference between the exercise price of options granted to employees and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant for financial statement purposes in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
we recognize this compensation charge over the vesting periods of the shares purchasable upon exercise of options 
should our assumptions of fair value change  the amount recorded as intrinsic value may increase or decrease in the future 
there was no deferred compensation related to options issued during we reversed prior year deferred compensation of approximately  related to employee terminations 
we recorded amortization of  during the year ended december  in we recorded deferred stock compensation of million and related amortization of million during the year ended december  to date  we have recorded stock based compensation of million and related amortization expense of million 
we are applying a graded vesting amortization policy for our deferred compensation 
stock based compensation charges also include the periodic revaluation of stock options that we have granted to non employees  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
and emerging issues task force no 
pursuant to this accounting literature  equity instruments  such as options  are required to be recorded at the fair value of the consideration received  or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever may be more readily measured 
for grants to our non employees  the fair value of the equity instrument issued is more readily measured and we assign value to the options using a black scholes methodology 
as required  we revalue these options over the period when earned in accordance with their respective terms 
should our input assumptions change  for example  fair value of common stock at the measurement date  the fair value of our non employee consultant compensation will change 
we recorded stock based compensation expense totaling  for the year ended december    for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  in connection with the grant of stock options to our non employees 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board  referred to as fasb  issued statement no 
 revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes accounting principal board opinion  referred to as apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach to accounting in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that extended the compliance date for periods ending after january  currently  we account for these payments under the intrinsic value provisions of apb no 
effective january  the company will adopt statement r using the modified prospective method 
the company will commence the new method of valuing stock based compensation as prescribed by statement r on all stock based awards granted after the effective date 
the company estimates that the expense associated with recognition of additional non cash compensation expense related to such awards will be approximately million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our exposure to market risk is limited to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  federal agency notes  corporate debt securities and united states treasury notes  with the effective duration of the portfolio less than one year  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
most of our transactions are conducted in united states dollars  although we do have some agreements with vendors located outside the united states 
transactions under some of these agreements are conducted in united states dollars  subject to adjustment based on significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
transactions under other of these agreements are conducted in the local foreign currency 
we have a wholly owned subsidiary  barrier therapeutics  nv  which is located in geel  belgium and a wholly owned subsidiary  barrier therapeutics canada inc  which is located in toronto  canada 
except for funding being received under our grant from a belgian governmental agency  which is denominated in euros and locally earned interest income  all research costs incurred by barrier therapeutics  nv are funded under a service agreement with barrier therapeutics  inc from investments denominated in dollars 
our canadian subsidiary  barrier therapeutics canada  inc became operational in the third quarter of while we expect that there will be some income from sales of products during the next year which will be denominated in canadian dollars  most of the funding for these operations will also come from investments denominated in dollars 
therefore  we are subject to currency fluctuations and exchange rate gains and losses on these transactions 
if the exchange rate undergoes a change of  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
