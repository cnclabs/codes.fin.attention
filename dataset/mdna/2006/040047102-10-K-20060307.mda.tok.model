part i item business 
we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule drugs targeting g protein coupled receptors  or gpcrs  in four major therapeutic areas metabolic  central nervous system  cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases 
our drug candidates act on or through known and orphan gpcrs  and were discovered using our gpcr focused drug discovery technologies and capabilities 
we incorporated in april we have four internally discovered  clinical stage drug candidates 
the most advanced is apd  a selective ht 
c 
serotonin receptor agonist under investigation for the treatment of obesity 
we recently completed a patient  week phase b clinical trial of apd in obese patients  which demonstrated highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss versus placebo at all three doses studied 
we expect to begin a phase clinical trial in the second half of our lead drug candidate for the treatment of insomnia is apd  a compound with a novel mechanism of action a selective ht 
a 
serotonin receptor inverse agonist 
we expect to begin a phase clinical trial of apd by the end of the first quarter of we also have two clinical stage collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies merck co  inc began a phase clinical trial in the third quarter of of a drug candidate we discovered for the treatment of atherosclerosis and related disorders  and ortho mcneil  inc  a johnson johnson company  began a phase clinical trial in february of apd  a drug candidate we discovered for the treatment of type diabetes 
our goal is to discover  develop and commercialize novel  orally bio available drugs that address major unmet medical needs by targeting gpcrs 
gpcrs are a class of receptors that mediate the majority of cell to cell communication in humans and a high percentage of today s prescription drugs target one or more gpcrs 
we believe that approved gpcr based drugs target about  or  of the approximately known gpcrs  predominantly in the biogenic amine family  a sub family of class gpcrs 
gpcrs are categorized as known when their naturally occurring  or native  ligands have been identified 
scientists have used molecular cloning in combination with the sequencing of the human genome to identify both additional receptor subtypes of known gpcrs as well as hundreds of novel gpcrs 
these novel gpcrs are categorized as orphan gpcrs because their native ligands have not been identified 
we believe orphan gpcrs offer significant promise for the development of novel gpcr based therapeutics  and  therefore  are an important focus of our discovery research 
we believe our gpcr focused technologies and integrated discovery and development capabilities will allow us to continue to build our pipeline of unique and selective drug candidates 
we intend to commercialize our drug candidates independently and with partners 
we have retained marketing rights to our development programs  except for those relating to our cardiovascular collaboration with merck and our diabetes collaboration with ortho mcneil 
we have not received regulatory approval for  or generated commercial revenues from  marketing or selling drugs 
for the last three years ended december  all of our revenues have been derived from our collaborators 
our research development programs we have a diverse drug candidate pipeline that targets large and attractive market opportunities in several therapeutic areas

c 
receptor agonist for the treatment of obesity that is expected to enter phase clinical development in the second half of obesity affects tens of millions of adults and children in the united states and poses serious long term threats to their health and welfare 
studies have shown that modest weight loss of as little as five percent of initial body weight can result in a meaningful reduction in the risks of other diseases associated with obesity  such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease 
currently  medical treatment options for obesity and metabolic syndrome are very limited 
two non selective  serotonin acting drugs widely used for weight loss  fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine often used in combination with phentermine  the combination of which was commonly referred to as fen phen  though efficacious as appetite suppressants and for treatment of obesity  were withdrawn from the market in after reported incidences of heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension associated with their usage 
based on our preclinical studies and clinical trial data to date  we believe that apd stimulates the ht 
c 
serotonin receptor more selectively than  and is therefore unlikely to cause the cardiovascular side effects associated with  fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine 
mechanism of action 
apd selectively stimulates the ht 
c 
serotonin receptor  a gpcr located in the hypothalamus 
stimulation of this hypothalamic receptor is strongly associated with feeding behavior and satiety 
we conducted preclinical studies examining the activity and ht receptor subtype specificity of apd in these studies  apd demonstrated a high affinity and specificity for the ht 
c 
receptor  with approximately fold and fold selectivity over the ht 
a 
and ht 
b 
receptors  respectively  and no pharmacologic activity at other serotonin receptors 
the fenfluramines release serotonin  and their primary metabolite  norfenfluramine  also has activity at the ht 
b 
receptor  stimulation of which has been implicated in the heart valve abnormalities associated with these drugs 
because of its selectivity  we believe that apd is unlikely to cause the cardiovascular side effects associated with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine 
this belief has been recently supported in our clinical studies of four and weeks duration in which no apparent effects of the drug were seen on heart valves or pulmonary arterial pressures 
however  additional studies will be required to confirm these results 
clinical development 
we have completed multiple phase and phase studies of apd the first phase study included obese patients dosed for days  and the second included obese patients dosed for weeks 
highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful weight loss was observed for the term of both studies  without evidence of any apparent drug effect on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressures  as assessed by serial echocardiograms 
apd was generally well tolerated in both phase studies 
in july  we announced results from a three part phase a clinical trial of apd that established a maximum tolerated dose for the drug candidate 
in november  we announced results from a phase b clinical trial of apd in obese volunteers 
apd was well tolerated  there were no severe or serious adverse events reported and no withdrawals due to an adverse event 
based on a comparison of echocardiograms taken at screening with those taken at the end of treatment and two and three months thereafter  there was no apparent drug effect on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressures 
in may  we announced phase a clinical trial results of a randomized  double blinded  multiple dose  day study of apd in obese patients comparing doses of mg  mg and mg of apd to placebo 
over the day treatment period there was a highly statistically significant p average weight loss of pounds in patients taking the mg dose of apd versus pounds for the placebo group 
apd was generally well tolerated at all doses investigated in the trial 
an assessment of follow up echocardiograms taken at the end of dosing and approximately days after patients received their first doses of apd in the phase a clinical trial indicated no apparent drug effect on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressures 
in june  we began a randomized  double blinded  multiple dose  week phase b clinical trial of apd in obese patients comparing doses of mg and mg once daily and mg twice daily of apd to placebo 
the primary endpoint of the trial was weight loss after administration of apd for weeks 
in december  we announced that over the week treatment period  there was a highly statistically significant p average weight loss of  and pounds at daily doses of mg  mg and mg mg dosed twice daily  respectively  in patients taking apd  compared to pounds for the placebo group 
as in the phase a clinical trial  weight loss was progressive 
apd was generally well tolerated at all doses investigated in the trial and there were no apparent effects on heart valves or pulmonary artery pressures  as assessed by echocardiograms taken at baseline and at the end of the treatment period 
development plan 
following discussions with the fda  we plan to begin our first pivotal phase clinical trial in the second half of we anticipate that the primary endpoint for this trial will be weight loss over a one year period versus placebo 
we expect to plan our phase program to meet or exceed the relevant fda guidelines  which for this type of indication typically require the enrollment of thousands of patients and multiple years to execute 
intellectual property 
as of january   we had issued patents covering compositions of matter for apd and related compounds  and related methods of treatment  in the united states  countries in europe including germany  france  the united kingdom  italy and spain  and hong kong  and applications pending in about other countries including japan  canada and china 
apd our lead drug candidate for insomnia  apd  is a novel and selective ht 
a 
receptor inverse agonist that we expect to enter a phase clinical trial by the end of the first quarter of the national institutes of health estimated in that between to percent of us adults report some level of insomnia and that insomnia is a chronic problem for about percent of the population 
in these cases  the lack of restful sleep impairs the person s ability to carry out their daily responsibilities because they are too tired or have trouble concentrating 
however  the great majority of insomnia patients do not seek treatment 
currently marketed therapies for insomnia include ambien and ambien cr  marketed by sanofi aventis  lunesta  marketed by sepracor  sonata  marketed by king pharmaceuticals  inc  rozerem  a melatonin mt and mt agonist marketed by takeda pharmaceuticals north america  inc  and various benzodiazepines  including valium 
with the exception of rozerem  these therapies generally work by activating the gaba a receptor in the brain  causing a general cns suppressive effect 
while the gaba a drugs may be effective at initiating sleep  they have side effects including the risk of developing tolerance to the drug and the potential for causing a sensation of dullness and lethargy upon awakening  often referred to as the hangover effect 
in addition  gaba a drugs are dea scheduled  controlled substances due to their potential for abuse 
despite these limitations  current worldwide sales estimates for medications for insomnia are in excess of billion for mechanism of action 
preclinical data demonstrate that by selectively targeting the ht 
a 
receptor  apd acts through a different mechanism than currently marketed insomnia drugs  blocking a general cns activating effect  rather than initiating a general cns suppressive effect 
because of the different mechanism of action  apd may not have the side effects generally associated with currently marketed gaba a drugs 
through this novel mechanism  apd has the potential to reduce insomnia symptoms and improve sleep maintenance by decreasing the number of awakenings during the night  decreasing the amount of wake time after initial sleep onset and increasing the amount of time spent in deep sleep  or slow wave sleep stage and stage sleep  the most restorative type of sleep 
our preclinical studies have shown that  in animals  apd increases both the quality and total time of non rem sleep  the most restorative phase of the sleep cycle in humans  while having no effect on rem rapid eye movement or dream sleep 
the total increase in non rem sleep time was manifested by fewer bouts of longer duration  indicating an increase in sleep consolidation 
in addition  animals treated with apd showed an increase in delta power during non rem sleep  a brain wave activity associated with increased sleep intensity 
the improvements in non rem duration and quality observed with apd administration were at least as robust as those observed with a prototypic gaba a hypnotic control drug  ambien 
however  unlike ambien  apd did not adversely affect rem sleep in these studies 
we believe these animal data suggest that apd has the potential to improve the treatment of insomnia over gaba a hypnotics 
clinical development 
in december  we initiated our phase clinical trial program of apd in healthy volunteers 
the phase program consisted of three clinical trials designed to evaluate the single and multiple dose safety and pharmacokinetics of apd in normal volunteers 
additionally  it evaluated the pharmacodynamics of nighttime dosing by assessing effects on sleep patterns in normal volunteers using polysomnography 
in june  we announced results from the phase clinical trial program of apd apd was well tolerated at all doses investigated in the phase program 
the announced top line data demonstrated that apd caused a robust and highly statistically significant p increase in the amount of deep  or slow wave  sleep in volunteers with normal sleep wake patterns 
in addition  other statistically significant signals indicative of improved sleep maintenance were seen  including statistically significant increases in stage and stage sleep  reductions in stage sleep  reductions in the number of awakenings and an increase in delta power  the deepest form of slow wave sleep 
development plan 
following allowance by the fda  we plan to begin a phase clinical trial by the end of the first quarter of in this three way crossover  dose ranging trial  we expect to enroll approximately patients with insomnia  and measure a number of parameters  including primarily measures of sleep maintenance but also time to sleep onset 
we expect results from that trial around the middle of intellectual property 
as of january   we had issued patents covering compositions of matter for apd and related compounds  and related methods of treatment  in countries in europe including germany  france  the united kingdom  italy and spain and in lebanon  and applications pending in approximately other jurisdictions including the united states  japan  canada and china and before the wipo  designating all contracting states 
apd apd is a novel  orally bio available and selective inverse agonist of the ht 
a 
serotonin receptor that is in preclinical development as our lead anti thrombotic drug candidate 
thrombosis is the formation of a clot  or thrombus  inside a blood vessel that restricts the flow of blood 
the formation of a thrombus is often caused by an injury to the wall of the blood vessel 
the injury to the blood vessel activates platelets  which then aggregate and adhere to one another as they start to release certain factors  including serotonin  that facilitate thrombosis 
thrombi that form in diseased atherosclerotic arteries of the heart may cause acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction  and thrombi that form in the vessels of the brain may cause stroke 
the american heart association estimates that in the united states alone over million people alive in had survived either a myocardial infarction or a stroke 
to reduce the risk of future events  many subjects receive daily anti thrombotic therapy 
worldwide sales of plavix  a leading anti thrombotic marketed by bristol myers squibb and sanofi aventis  has been estimated to exceed billion in mechanism and preclinical data 
preclinical data suggest that apd is a novel  orally bio available and selective inverse agonist of the ht 
a 
serotonin receptor 
serotonin activation of the ht 
a 
receptor on platelets and vascular smooth muscle is thought to play an important role in the events leading to thrombosis 
consequently  elevated serotonin levels have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk 
normally  when a platelet is activated by one of a number of factors such as thrombin or collagen  the platelet releases serotonin  which  based on preclinical studies  promotes platelet aggregation  vasoconstriction and intimal hyperplasia  or thickening of the vessel wall 
by blocking activation of the ht 
a 
receptor on platelets and in other cardiovascular tissues  apd may curb platelet aggregation  vasoconstriction and intimal hyperplasia in the clinical setting  thereby reducing the risk of thrombosis 
we believe apd represents a new approach to reducing the risk of arterial thrombo embolic disease 
in animal models  apd demonstrated a better therapeutic index than certain other approved anti thrombotic agents we tested due to a separation of anti thrombotic activity from the increased bleeding that may be seen with these agents  which are members of other classes of drugs 
development plan 
we advanced apd into preclinical development in december and plan to initiate clinical development around the end of intellectual property 
as of january   we had patent applications covering compositions of matter for apd  and related methods of treatment  pending before the wipo designating all contracting states  and in additional jurisdictions that are not contracting states of the wipo 
apd ortho mcneil collaboration our lead drug candidates for diabetes target an orphan gpcr  the glucose dependent insulinotropic receptor  or the gdi receptor previously referred to by us as the aj receptor 
the gdi receptor is a novel receptor discovered by us that has the potential to stimulate insulin production in response to increases in blood glucose 
apd  a novel orally administered drug candidate discovered by us that targets the gdi receptor  was advanced into a phase clinical trial in collaboration with ortho mcneil in february diabetes is a major worldwide disease 
based on data  the international diabetes foundation estimated that in there were million adults with diabetes worldwide  an increase of over since these figures included approximately million in the united states and approximately million in the european region 
approximately  or million  of diabetics suffer from type diabetes  the adult onset form of the disease 
type diabetes is characterized by inadequate response to insulin and or inadequate secretion of insulin as blood glucose levels rise 
therapies for type diabetes are directed toward correcting the body s inadequate response with oral medications  or directly modifying insulin levels through direct injection of insulin or insulin analogs 
oral medications for type diabetes include insulin releasers such as glyburide  insulin sensitizers such as actos and avandia and agents that slow the uptake of glucose into the bloodstream such as precose and glyset 
the worldwide market for diabetes medications exceeded billion and oral anti diabetes drugs exceeded billion in however  a significant portion of type diabetics fail oral medication and require injected insulin therapy 
current oral medications for type diabetes have a number of side effects  including hypoglycemia  weight gain and edema 
numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are seeking to develop insulin sensitizers  novel insulin formulations and other therapeutics to improve the treatment of diabetes 
mechanism and preclinical data 
we have found the gdi receptor to be expressed in beta cells  the cells in the pancreas responsible for producing insulin in response to increases in blood glucose 
we believe the gdi receptor represents a novel mechanism for generating a new class of drugs for diabetes that may offer advantages over current approaches 
our preclinical results indicate that stimulating the gdi receptor allows beta cells to produce insulin more efficiently in response to changes in blood glucose levels 
in addition  we have found in these studies that stimulation of the gdi receptor leads to increased levels and activity of intracellular factors thought to be involved in the preservation of beta cells 
unlike the glp receptor  the gdi receptor appears amenable to small molecule drug development 
we have discovered potent  selective and orally available small molecule agonists of the receptor that improve glucose tolerance and lower blood glucose levels in animal models of diabetes 
the gdi receptor mechanism is glucose dependent  so that in our animal studies our compounds only lowered blood glucose when it rose above normal levels  such as after a meal 
our preclinical results indicate these compounds do not lower normal fasting baseline glucose levels in animal models and  therefore  do not cause hypoglycemia  unlike the glucose insensitive sulphonylureas 
development plans and partnership status 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with ortho mcneil to further develop compounds for the potential treatment of type diabetes and other disorders 
in january  we received a million upfront payment and two milestone payments of million each  and  in february  we achieved a million milestone related to ortho mcneil s initiation of the phase clinical trial of apd we are eligible to receive a total of million in milestone payments for each compound  as well as royalty payments associated with ortho mcneil s commercialization of any products discovered under the agreement 
these milestone payments include development and approval milestone payments of up to million for the first indication and million for the second indication for each compound  and up to million in sales milestone payments for each product resulting from the collaboration 
intellectual property 
as of january   we had issued patents related to the gdi receptor target that is the subject of our diabetes collaboration with ortho mcneil in australia  new zealand  and european countries including germany  france  the united kingdom  italy  switzerland  sweden and spain  and applications pending in eight additional jurisdictions including the united states and japan 
merck cardiovascular collaboration there are very successful drugs available for lowering ldl cholesterol 
however  development of novel  effective therapies to increase hdl cholesterol remains a major focus of research 
we believe that such therapies may reduce the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease and compete in the large anti hyperlipidemic market 
in october  we entered into a research and licensing agreement with merck to collaborate on three gpcrs to develop therapeutics for atherosclerosis and related disorders 
we believe one or more of these gpcrs plays a role in regulating plasma lipid profiles  including hdl cholesterol  the so called good cholesterol  and is responsible for the hdl raising activity of niacin 
in october  we extended and expanded our collaboration with merck and merck selected one of our compounds for preclinical development 
in july  we announced the achievement of a million milestone related to the initiation by merck of a phase clinical trial of an arena discovered compound 
as of december   we had received million from merck in upfront and milestone payments and an equity investment 
we may receive additional milestone payments of up to million for merck s clinical and marketing achievements  as well as royalty payments associated with merck s commercialization of any products discovered under the agreement 
in addition  we have received research funding from merck since the inception of our collaboration  and  under our agreement  merck will pay us million per year for collaboration research through october  intellectual property 
we have an issued patent in the united states related to the niacin receptor target that is the subject of our cardiovascular disease collaboration with merck 
other research and development programs cardiovascular 
acute myocardial infarction  which is commonly known as a heart attack  is often followed by heart failure in survivors 
myocardial infarction and often heart failure are direct consequences of atherosclerosis  and both remain major causes of death 
we have identified certain gpcrs that we believe play a role in these processes and are seeking to identify small molecules directed at these gpcr targets that we believe could provide cardio protection following myocardial infarction 
cns disorders 
many gpcrs are found predominately in the brain or the cns  and  therefore  we believe targeting gpcrs provides an opportunity to selectively treat various cns diseases 
many approved drugs for indications ranging from insomnia and narcolepsy to depression  schizophrenia and parkinson s disease  target gpcrs 
our discovery efforts in cns disorders are focused on indications with large market opportunities where current therapies have significant limitations 
inflammatory disorders 
we are developing small molecule therapeutics that target gpcrs involved in the inflammatory process 
we have identified gpcrs that are found in specific immune cell types 
we believe these gpcrs modulate the inflammatory process  and we are applying our screening technologies to these targets to identify small molecules that could activate or inhibit these gpcrs 
some of the gpcrs we are targeting are expressed on t and b cells and macrophages  and could be important in the modulation of key cytokines that mediate inflammatory processes such as tnf alpha 
other diabetes programs 
for metabolic diseases  we are working on a series of orphan gpcr targets in addition to the gdi receptor in order to develop orally available therapies to treat type and type diabetes 
for example  we are conducting research with receptors that may act to regulate glucose uptake  glucose absorption  insulin sensitivity  insulin secretion  lipid levels and production of glucose in the liver 
in order to treat general metabolic disease  we have prioritized gpcrs that have the potential to modulate blood glucose and lipid levels 
other obesity programs 
in addition to apd and other compounds that act on the ht 
c 
serotonin receptor  we have discovery programs focused on several different gpcrs implicated in obesity 
our drug discovery efforts are directed at identifying novel drug candidates that target gpcrs in the cns and peripheral tissues to reduce fat mass in humans 
we have identified both known and orphan gpcrs expressed in the hypothalamus  an area of the brain known to be critical for regulating satiety and metabolism  that we believe regulate food intake and weight 
we have also identified gpcrs in fat cells that may represent targets for obesity 
we have identified early lead compounds for obesity targets other than the ht 
c 
serotonin receptor  and are currently evaluating these compounds for their ability to reduce food intake and body weight 
our proprietary gpcr technologies and programs our drug candidates have resulted from our gpcr focused drug discovery technologies and capabilities  including constitutively activated receptor technology  or cart  and our melanophore technology  and our approach to drug discovery and development 
our integrated drug discovery platform allows us to determine gpcr function  tissue and cell distribution  and potential relation to disease 
traditional ligand based drug screening methods require the time consuming identification and use of the receptor s native ligand to discover small molecule compounds that will bind at  or close to  the native ligand s binding site on the receptor 
in contrast  we have developed technologies that do not require the use of the native ligand 
instead  we are able to activate a gpcr so that the g protein signals without the presence of the native ligand  by using our constitutively activated receptor technology  or cart  and other technologies 
applying our technologies to constitutively activate gpcrs assists in discovering drug like compounds by stimulating the gpcr to mimic the biological response that occurs when the native ligand binds to the receptor 
these technologies help avoid a major bottleneck in drug discovery efforts at orphan receptors by eliminating the step of first identifying the native ligand 
we have found that our constitutive activation technologies can be applied broadly to gpcrs 
our constitutive activation technologies allow us to simultaneously identify drug leads that act as receptor activators  or agonists  which increase the detected biological response  or act as receptor inhibitors  which decrease the detected response 
we can also identify inverse agonists  which inhibit ligand independent  as well as ligand dependent  receptor activity 
we believe that our constitutive activation technologies offer several key advantages for drug discovery over traditional screening techniques that require the use of the native ligand including not requiring prior identification of the native ligand for an orphan receptor  enhancing the detection of  and allowing us to simultaneously identify  both receptor inhibitor and receptor activator drug leads  allowing for the identification of drug leads that inhibit both ligand independent and ligand dependent activity  and providing the ability to discover novel and improved therapeutics directed at known receptors 
we use our constitutive activation technologies in combination with our patented melanophore technology 
our melanophore technology is a broadly applicable high throughput screen for gpcrs 
when a gpcr is activated either by a ligand or independent of a ligand through constitutive activation  the gpcr couples to one or more g proteins  including those belonging to the gs  gq  and gi o classes 
melanophore technology can detect gpcrs that couple to major g protein classes 
we believe our melanophore technology is  therefore  also well suited for studies of orphan receptors whose coupling parameters are unknown 
we believe melanophore technology provides us with a robust  reproducible  high throughput and low cost means for identifying and optimizing gpcr agonists  antagonists  and inverse agonists  and is sensitive enough to detect the constitutive activity of many gpcrs 
our strategy the key elements of our scientific and business strategy are to advance our lead programs 
we intend to continue to advance our current drug candidates  with a partner or independently  through clinical development and  if successful  to commercialization 
discover and develop additional small molecule drug candidates targeting gpcrs 
we intend to continue to discover and develop orally bio available  small molecule compounds for gpcrs identified or validated through our research efforts 
focus on attractive market opportunities 
obesity  insomnia  diabetes  atherosclerosis and arterial thrombosis each represent multi billion dollar market opportunities 
we intend to continue to focus on these and other markets with attractive commercial potential 
retain significant commercial rights and or economic value for our drug candidates 
we intend to maximize the value of our drug candidates through both independent development and partnerships with pharmaceutical and larger biotechnology companies with commercial infrastructures 
continue to build our development capabilities 
to capitalize on our discoveries  we plan to continue to expand our clinical development capabilities as our drug candidates enter into  and move through  clinical trials 
maintain strong discovery research capabilities 
our proprietary technologies  our drug discovery infrastructure and the integrated approach to research used by our scientists  have allowed us to identify a number of gpcr targets and novel compounds 
we believe these and other discoveries will continue to fuel our pipeline 
intellectual property our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology  compounds and information  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright  and trademark laws  as well as confidentiality agreements  licensing agreements  and other agreements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as of january   we owned  in part or in whole  or had exclusively licensed the following patents in the united states  in european countries  eight in new zealand  five in australia  five in lebanon  one in japan  one in china  one in singapore  one in hong kong and one in israel 
in addition  as of january   we had approximately patent applications before the united states patent and trademark office  foreign patent offices and international patent authorities 
these patents and patent applications are divided into distinct families of related patents that are directed to cart  melanophore technology  other novel screening methods  chemical compositions of matter  methods of treatment using chemical compositions  or gpcr genes 
one of our patent families was exclusively in licensed and contains a single issued patent 
seven of our patent families containing a total of eight patents and patent applications were the subject of joint inventions by our employees and the employees of other entities 
the remaining patent families  which include a total of patents and patent applications  were invented solely by our employees 
there is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue  or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method 
except for the us patents relating to our melanophore technology  the term of most of our other current patents commenced  and most of our future patents  if any  will commence  on the date of issuance and terminate years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application 
since our us melanophore patents were issued under now superseded rules that provided a patent term of years from the date of issuance  the term of these patents are scheduled to end in because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology patent applications is often more than three years  the resulting term of our pending patent applications  if any  on our drug candidates and technologies may be substantially less than years 
in the united states  europe and some other jurisdictions  patent term extensions are available for certain delays in either patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval processes 
however  due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions  there is no assurance that our patents will be afforded extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval 
we seek patent protection for our key inventions  including clinical candidates and drug candidates we identify  routes for chemical synthesis  cart  new receptors that we discover  and genetically altered receptors 
it has generally been possible to obtain broad composition of matter patents on novel chemical compounds 
it has also generally been possible to obtain broad method patents for techniques and procedures for screening and drug identification technologies 
it has generally been more difficult to obtain broad composition of matter patents for nucleic acid and amino acid sequences 
however  it has been possible to obtain patents that protect specific sequences and functional equivalents of those sequences 
furthermore  intellectual property law allows for separate and distinct patents for novel  altered genetic sequences that have improved properties over previously disclosed sequences 
we believe that we can obtain patents on certain of our cart activated receptor sequences because they are not functional equivalents of the natural version of the receptor 
in addition to patent protection  we rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how  and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position 
to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information  all of our employees are required to enter into and adhere to an employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement  laboratory notebook policy  and invention disclosure protocol  as a condition of employment 
additionally  our employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement requires that our employees not bring to us  or use without proper authorization  any third party proprietary technology 
we also require our consultants and collaborators that have access to proprietary property and information to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements in our favor before beginning their relationship with us 
while such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf  they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and significant change 
we face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing the same or similar technologies 
we also face significant competition from organizations that are pursuing drugs that would compete with the drug candidates we are developing 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations  which include many large  well financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies 
the focus of our scientific and business strategy is on gpcrs 
we believe that many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other organizations have internal drug discovery programs focused on gpcrs 
in addition  other companies have attempted to overcome the problems associated with traditional drug screening by embarking on a variety of alternative strategies 
developments by others may render our drug candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
our present competitors with respect to apd include abbott laboratories  which markets meridia  and hoffman la roche  the us prescription drug unit of the roche group  which markets xenical 
a potential future competitor is sanofi aventis  which is developing rimonabant  a cannabinoid blocker 
in addition  we believe that there are potentially competing ht 
c 
programs at roche and glaxosmithkline  inc in addition to the marketed compounds described above under the apd discussion  pfizer neurocrine have submitted an nda for indiplon 
we believe sanofi aventis and eli lilly  and possibly other companies  are developing potentially competing ht 
a 
programs for insomnia 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater drug development capabilities and financial  scientific and marketing resources than we do 
additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated with our competitors 
as a result  our competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the research  development  marketing and promotion of drug discovery techniques or therapeutic products  or to adapt more readily to technological advances than we can 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda approval  or commercializing drugs before we do 
we expect to encounter significant competition for the principal drug candidates we are developing 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their drug candidates before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage 
furthermore  we will be competing against companies with substantially greater manufacturing  marketing  distribution and selling capabilities  and any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use 
we rely on our collaborators for support of development programs and for the manufacturing and marketing of drug candidates 
our collaborators may be conducting multiple drug development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subject of their agreements with us  which may negatively impact the development of drugs that they discover that are subject to our agreements 
generally  our agreements with our collaborators do not preclude them from pursuing development efforts in one or more therapeutic areas of interest in which we have internal development efforts ongoing 
in addition  we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for such collaborative arrangements  and technological and other developments by others may make it more difficult for us to establish such relationships 
government regulation we plan to develop and commercialize selected drug candidates by ourselves and license other candidates to partners for further development and commercialization 
our and our collaborators on going drug development activities are subject to the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in the united states and other countries in which these drug candidates may be tested or in which drugs may be marketed 
the regulatory review and approval process  which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug candidate  is lengthy and uncertain 
before marketing in the united states  any pharmaceutical or therapeutic product must undergo rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
moreover  the fda imposes substantial requirements on new product research and the clinical development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products  including testing and clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of these products 
in the united states  we are also subject to other federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including regulation of the use and care of laboratory animals 
in addition  the state of california imposes licensing requirements on facilities manufacturing for clinical trials or for commercial marketing of drugs 
governments in other countries have similar requirements for testing  approval and marketing  including in the european union the eu 
before commencing clinical trial investigations in humans in europe  we and or our collaborators must submit the appropriate applications to applicable authorities in member countries 
before commencing clinical investigations in humans in the united states  we and or our collaborators must submit an investigational new drug  or ind  application to the fda 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap or be combined 
phase represents the initial administration of the drug candidate to a small group of either healthy volunteers or patients to test for safety and tolerability  absorption  distribution  metabolism  elimination and clinical pharmacology 
phase involves studies in patients to begin to assess the effectiveness of the drug candidate  to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse effects 
once a drug candidate is found to have some effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in the targeted patient population  phase studies are initiated to establish safety and effectiveness in an expanded patient population and at multiple clinical study sites 
the fda may require further post marketing studies  referred to as phase studies 
the fda reviews both the clinical plans and the results of the trials and we  our collaborators or the fda may decide that clinical trials should be discontinued at any time if any significant safety issues are identified 
clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board or ethics committee oversight  informed consent  good clinical practices and other fda or other regulatory authority oversight 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and is difficult to predict 
clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals 
additional factors that may cause delay  termination or increased cost of our or our collaborators clinical trials include  among other factors slow patient enrollment  the eligibility criteria for the study  competition with clinical trials for other drug candidates  lack of sufficient clinical supplies of the drug candidate  lack of effectiveness of the drug candidate being tested  adverse medical effects or side effects in treated patients  unfavorable results from ongoing preclinical studies  inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at a study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring the clinical trial  delays in approval from a study site s institutional review board  and longer treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or to determine the appropriate dose for the drug candidate 
if preclinical and clinical studies are successful  the results  together with other information about the drug candidate and its manufacture  are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application  or nda  to request marketing approval 
before receiving fda approval to market a drug candidate  we or our collaborators must demonstrate that the drug candidate is safe and effective through clinical trials in the patient population that will be treated 
the approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
additional animal studies or clinical trials may be requested during the fda review period that may delay marketing approval 
as part of the approval process  each manufacturing facility must be inspected by the fda 
among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform with federally mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
both before and after approval  manufacturers must expend time  money and effort to ensure compliance with cgmps  and the fda conducts periodic inspections to certify such compliance 
violations may result in the issuance of warning letters  restrictions on the drug or manufacturer  including costly recalls or withdrawal of the drug from the market  or other enforcement action 
if regulatory approval of a drug candidate is granted by the fda  this approval will be limited to those specific conditions for which the drug candidate  as demonstrated through clinical studies  has an appropriate safety and efficacy balance 
after fda approval for the initial indication  further clinical trials will be necessary to gain approval for the use of the drug for additional indications 
marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is prohibited 
the fda requires that adverse effects be reported to the fda and may also require post marketing surveillance or testing to monitor for adverse effects  which can involve significant expense 
even after fda approvals are obtained  a marketed drug is subject to their continual review 
later discovery of previously unknown information or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a drug or withdrawal of the drug from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions 
furthermore  failure to obtain reimbursement coverage from governmental or third party insurers may adversely impact successful commercialization 
we have a chemical development facility that we are using for process research  the scale up and production of intermediates and other compounds for research and development purposes  and the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients for use in human clinical trials 
california law prohibits the shipment of a drug candidate or drug from a manufacturing facility in california for any clinical testing or commercial use prior to satisfaction of manufacturing licensing requirements 
our facility was inspected and licensed by the california department of health services and we believe it is in compliance with state regulatory requirements for the manufacture and distribution of active pharmaceutical ingredients 
sources and availability of raw materials  intermediates  and clinical supplies in general  we purchase raw materials  intermediates and clinical supplies on the open market 
substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on us 
however  currently we have a primary source of supply for some key intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredients api and finished drug products fdp for our lead development projects 
the loss of a primary source of supply would potentially delay our lead development projects  apd  apd and apd  and potentially those of our collaborators 
compliance with environmental regulations we are subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the controlled substances act and other present and potential future federal  state or local regulations 
our research and development programs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  biological materials and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources 
our compliance with these laws and regulations did not  and is not expected to  have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
research and development expenses research and development activities are the primary source of our expenses  which include personnel costs  research supplies  facility and equipment costs and preclinical and clinical study fees 
research expenses related to the development and improvement of our technology and drug candidates totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  included in these expenses is research that was sponsored by our collaborators 
we estimate that research expenses incurred on projects sponsored by our collaborators totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  employees as of february   we had employees  including in research and development and employees in administration  which includes finance  legal  facilities and other general support areas 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement

item a 
risk factors 
an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the risks described below  together with other information in this form k  before making investment decisions regarding our stock 
if any of the following events actually occur  our business  operating results  prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
risks relating to our business we will need additional funds to conduct our planned research and development efforts  and we may not be able to obtain such funds 
we had losses of million for the year ended december   and we had an accumulated deficit of million from our inception in april through december  our losses have resulted in large part from the significant research and development expenditures we have made in seeking to identify and validate new drug targets and develop compounds that could become marketed drugs 
we expect that our operating expenses over the next several years will be significant and that we will continue to have significant operating losses in the near term  even if we or our collaborators are successful in advancing our compounds or partnered compounds 
we do not have any commercial drugs 
it takes many years and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to successfully develop a preclinical or early clinical compound into a marketed drug 
we have substantially less money than we need to successfully develop a compound into a marketed drug 
additional funding may not be available to us or may not be available on terms that you or we believe are favorable 
if additional funding is not available  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs 
our stock price could decline significantly based on the results and timing of our clinical trials 
we expect to announce results from our phase clinical trial of apd for insomnia by around the middle of and to announce the commencement of a phase clinical trial of apd for obesity in the second half of results of the phase clinical trial of apd may not be viewed favorably by us or third parties  including investors  analysts and potential collaborators 
in addition  we may not be successful in commencing the phase clinical trial of apd or phase clinical trial of apd on our projected timetable  if at all 
biotechnology company stock prices have declined significantly when clinical results were unfavorable or perceived negatively or when clinical trials were delayed or otherwise did not meet expectations 
failure to initiate or delays in our clinical trials of apd  apd or any of our other drug candidates  or unfavorable results or negative perceptions regarding any of such trials  could cause our stock price to decline significantly 
clinical trials for our drug candidates are expensive and time consuming  and their progress may be interrupted and their outcome is uncertain 
clinical trials are very expensive  difficult to design and implement  and can be more expensive than originally anticipated 
the clinical trial process is also time consuming 
assuming favorable results  we estimate that the clinical trials of our most advanced drug candidates will continue for several years and may take significantly longer to complete 
before we can obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any drug candidate that we wish to develop  we are required to complete extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for treatment of specific indications and monitor safety throughout the clinical development process 
all of our drug candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in drug development 
even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates are promising  such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda or any other us or foreign regulatory approval 
administering any of our drug candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects 
these side effects could interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of our drug candidate for any or all of the targeted indications 
the fda  other regulatory authorities  our collaborators  or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time 
any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our drug candidates  or in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our drug candidates  may severely harm our business and reputation 
the timing of the commencement  continuation and completion of clinical trials may be subject to significant delays relating to various causes  including lack of effectiveness during the clinical trials  side effects experienced by study participants or other safety issues  slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment  delays or inability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence a study or clinical holds or delays requiring suspension or termination of a study by a regulatory agency such as the fda after a study is commenced  delays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites  uncertainty regarding proper dosing  unfavorable results from on going clinical trials and preclinical studies  failure of our clinical research organizations to comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or otherwise fail to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols  or difficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment  which may result in incomplete data 
our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation  which can be costly and time consuming  cause unanticipated delays  or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to develop or commercialize drugs 
the clinical development  manufacturing  labeling  packaging  storage  record keeping  advertising  promotion  export  marketing and distribution of our drug candidates are  and any resulting drugs will be  subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory agencies in the united states and by comparable governmental authorities in foreign markets 
neither our collaborators nor we are permitted to market our potential drugs in the united states until we receive regulatory approval from the fda 
neither our collaborators nor we have received marketing approval for any of our drug candidates 
the process of obtaining regulatory approval is expensive  often takes many years  and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the drug candidate involved 
specific preclinical data  chemical data  a proposed clinical study protocol and other information must be submitted to the fda as part of an ind application 
clinical trials may commence only after the ind application becomes effective 
a new drug application  or nda  must be supported by extensive clinical and preclinical data regarding manufacturing  process and controls to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug candidate 
approval policies or regulations may change 
moreover  failure to comply with the fda and other applicable foreign and united states regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions 
these include warning letters  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions  product seizure and detention  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production  and refusal to approve pending ndas  or supplements to approved ndas 
we submitted an ind application to the fda to permit us to commence a phase trial of apd in the united states 
the fda has subsequently requested additional and reformatted information  and the initiation of our phase trial is pending their review and allowance 
based on our communications with the fda  we expect to initiate our phase trial on apd by the end of the first quarter of  and to have results of this trial around the middle of this year 
however  we cannot be sure that the fda will not raise additional issues or that our proposed phase trial will be allowed to proceed in a timely manner or at all 
we have not previously filed ndas with the fda  nor have we previously conducted large scale phase trials  which are significantly larger and more complex than earlier stage trials 
this lack of experience may impede our ability to successfully complete these trials and obtain fda approval in a timely manner  if at all  for our drug candidates for which development and commercialization is our responsibility 
despite the time and expense invested  regulatory approval is very uncertain and never guaranteed and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical testing and clinical trials 
the fda has substantial discretion in the drug approval process 
the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for fda approval varies depending on the drug candidate  the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to address  and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate 
the fda can delay  limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons  including not finding a drug candidate sufficiently safe and or effective  not finding the data from preclinical testing and clinical trials sufficient to prove safety or efficacy  not approving of our or a third party manufacturers processes or facilities  or changes in its approval policies or the adoption of new regulations 
because  in part  of the early stage of our drug candidate research and development process  we cannot predict whether or not regulatory approval will be obtained for any drug we develop 
we are conducting clinical trials on two of our drug candidates  apd and apd  and two of our drug candidates are undergoing clinical trials by our partners  ortho mcneil and merck 
compounds developed by us  alone or with other parties  may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive marketing approval 
administering any of our drug candidates to humans may produce undesirable side effects 
these side effects could interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of our drug candidates and could result in the fda or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our drug candidates for any or all of the targeted indications 
if regulatory approval of a drug candidate is granted  the approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the drug candidate is demonstrated through clinical trials to be sufficiently safe and effective 
failure to obtain regulatory approval will delay or prevent us from commercializing drugs 
these risks also apply to the development activities of our collaborators  and we do not expect any drugs resulting from our collaborators research and development efforts to be commercially available for many years  if ever 
the fda  other regulatory authorities  our collaborators or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time 
any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our drug candidates  or in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any drugs resulting from our drug candidates  may severely harm our business and reputation 
the results of preclinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results  and our current drug candidates may not have favorable results in later studies or trials 
preclinical studies and phase and phase clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a drug candidate  but rather to test safety  to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics  and to understand the drug candidate s side effects at various doses and schedules 
success in preclinical studies or completed clinical trials does not ensure that later studies or trials  including continuing preclinical studies and large scale clinical trials  will be successful nor does it necessarily predict future results 
favorable results in early studies or trials may not be repeated in later studies or trials  and drug candidates in later stage trials may fail to show desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through initial stage trials 
unfavorable results from ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays  modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials 
in addition  we may report top line data from time to time 
top line data is based on preliminary analysis of key efficacy and safety data  and is subject to change 
a number of companies in the biotechnology industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals 
negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed  repeated or terminated 
in addition  failure to construct appropriate clinical trial protocols could result in the test or control group experiencing a disproportionate number of adverse events and could cause a clinical trial to be delayed  repeated or terminated 
our most advanced drug candidates  apd and apd  have not completed the large  pivotal phase trials for efficacy and safety that are required for fda approval 
preclinical data and the limited clinical results that we have obtained for apd and apd may not predict results from studies in larger numbers of subjects drawn from more diverse populations treated for longer periods of time or  in the case with apd  when patients with insomnia are studied rather than normal volunteers 
they also may not predict the ability of apd or apd to achieve or sustain the desired effects in the intended population or to do so safely 
in addition  in december we announced the commencement of preclinical studies with our anti platelet compound  apd  under investigation for the potential prevention of thromboembolic diseases  such as heart attacks and strokes 
we cannot be certain that results sufficiently favorable to justify commencement of phase studies around the end of will be obtained in these preclinical investigations 
we have developed apd to more selectively stimulate the ht 
c 
serotonin receptor because we believe this selectivity may avoid the cardiovascular side effects associated with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine  two serotonin releasing agents and non selective serotonin receptor agonists  both of which were withdrawn from the market in after reported incidences of heart valve disease and pulmonary hypertension associated with their usage 
we may not be correct in this belief  however  and apd s selectivity profile may not avoid the undesired side effects 
moreover  the potential relationship between the activity of apd and the activity of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine may result in increased fda regulatory scrutiny of the safety of apd and may raise potential adverse publicity in the marketplace  which could affect clinical enrollment or ultimately sales if apd is approved for sale 
in response to our investigational new drug  or ind  submission for apd  the fda recommended we assess the abuse potential and requested that we provide our plans for cardiac valve monitoring during phase and phase clinical trials 
we expect our communication with the fda on these issues to be ongoing 
we have developed apd to selectively inhibit the ht 
a 
serotonin receptor because we believe this mechanism may be better tolerated and improve sleep quality and maintenance as compared to existing sleep therapies 
preclinical data and the results from our phase clinical trial in subjects with normal sleep patterns may not predict apd s effects on sleep quality  sleep maintenance or sleep onset latency in patients with insomnia 
we will be required to demonstrate through larger scale clinical trials that these drug candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale 
there is typically a high rate of attrition from the failure of drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials 
to date  long term safety and efficacy have not yet been demonstrated in clinical trials for any of our drug candidates 
if apd or apd fails to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in any clinical trial  we will experience potentially significant delays in  or decide to abandon development of  that drug candidate 
if we abandon or are delayed in our development efforts related to apd  apd or any other drug candidate  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to continue our operations at the current level or become profitable  our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged  it may not be possible to complete financings  and our stock price would likely decrease significantly 
many of our research and development programs are in early stages of development  and may not result in the commencement of clinical trials 
many of our research and development programs are in the discovery or preclinical stage of development 
the process of discovering compounds with therapeutic potential is expensive  time consuming and unpredictable 
similarly  the process of conducting preclinical studies of compounds that we discover requires the commitment of a substantial amount of our technical and financial resources and personnel 
we may not discover additional compounds with therapeutic potential  and any of the compounds for which we are conducting preclinical studies may not result in the commencement of clinical trials 
if we are unable to identify and develop new drug candidates  we may not be able to maintain a clinical development pipeline or generate revenues 
the technologies on which we rely may not result in the discovery or development of commercially viable drugs 
our gpcr technologies include technologies that allow us to discover drug like compounds that act on receptor subtypes of known gpcrs and novel gpcrs where the native ligands have not been identified 
these methods of identifying  prioritizing and screening molecular targets are unproven  and may not result in the regulatory approval and commercialization of any therapeutic products 
we do not believe that there are any drugs on the market that have been discovered or developed using our proprietary technologies 
if we are unable to identify additional drug candidates using our proprietary drug discovery technologies  we may not be able to maintain a clinical development pipeline or generate revenues 
another company  organization or individual could have  or could develop  a technology targeting gpcrs to discover and develop compounds into drugs more effectively or efficiently than our screening and other technologies 
such a technology could render our technologies  in particular our constitutively activated receptor technology  or cart  and melanophore technology  obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we are not successful in advancing our lead programs  we may have to curtail some of our activities 
if we are not successful in achieving additional milestones under our cardiovascular collaboration with merck or our diabetes collaboration with ortho mcneil  or developing or partnering apd or apd or any of our other lead programs  we may not be able to raise additional capital or generate significant partnering revenues in the short term 
if we do not receive additional capital or partnering revenues  we may need to license some or all of our programs on financial terms that are unfavorable to us 
also  without additional capital or partnering revenues  we would need to re evaluate our strategy of moving multiple drug discovery and development programs forward while at the same time maintaining our research and discovery capabilities 
based on such evaluation  we may need to significantly curtail some of our current and planned programs and expenditures 
we do not know what programs  if any  we would need to curtail  but we believe narrowing our pipeline would reduce our opportunities for success 
our revenues depend upon the actions of our existing and potential collaborators 
our revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our revenues depend upon the success of our existing collaborations and on our ability to enter into new collaborations 
we will receive little additional revenues from our existing collaborators if our own or our collaborators research  development or  ultimately  marketing efforts are unsuccessful  or if our agreements are terminated early 
typically  our collaborators and not us control the development of compounds into drugs after we have met early preclinical scientific milestones 
in addition  we may not have complete access to information about the results and status of our collaborators clinical trials and regulatory programs and strategies 
we are not entitled to the more significant milestone payments under our agreements until our collaborators have advanced compounds in clinical testing 
our partners may not devote adequate resources to the development of our compounds and may not develop or implement a successful clinical or regulatory strategy 
only two of our partners  merck and ortho mcneil  have advanced our drug candidates into clinical testing and paid us the applicable milestones 
we cannot guarantee that any of the other development  approval or sales milestones in our existing or future collaborations will be satisfied  or that we will receive any payments for the achievement of those other milestones 
for the year ended december   revenues recognized under our collaboration with merck represented approximately of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   of our revenues were from our collaborations with merck and ortho mcneil 
we expect substantially all of our revenues for to be derived from our collaborations with merck and ortho mcneil 
our revenues will be materially impacted if our agreement with either merck or ortho mcneil is terminated  our collaborators do not devote their time and financial resources to develop compounds under our collaborations  our collaborators dispute whether we have achieved a milestone  rights to a particular receptor or compound  or other terms of our agreements  our collaborators use alternative technologies to our technologies and compete with us in developing drugs  or our collaborators experience failures in the discovery or development of compounds identified with our technologies or in the clinic or marketplace with other products that cause them to discontinue or slow down our collaboration 
our ability to enter into new collaborations depends on the outcomes of our preclinical and clinical testing 
we do not control these outcomes 
in addition  even if our testing is successful  pharmaceutical companies may not partner with us on terms that we believe are acceptable until we have advanced our drug candidates into the clinic and  possibly  through later stage clinical trials  if at all 
our collaboration agreements with merck and ortho mcneil may be terminated in certain circumstances 
the term of our amended collaborative research program with merck is three years from october  merck can terminate this program i for technical grounds  by giving days prior notice  if both merck and we agree that technical grounds have occurred  or ii in the event of our change in control as defined in the agreement  by giving days prior notice 
technical grounds include circumstances where our joint research committee a committee of an equal number of merck and our representatives concludes that a a significant adverse event affecting all the targets  all program compounds and all active compounds under the program has arisen during the conduct of the program  or b continuation of the program is no longer scientifically promising because the role of all the targets proves incorrect  or none of the targets are valid as a suitable target for development of a pharmaceutical product  or merck s patent department  upon consultation with our patent attorneys  makes a reasonable determination that valid third party patent rights block the achievement of significant program goals 
in addition  either party can terminate the agreement if the other party breaches its material obligations under the agreement by causes and reasons within its control  has not cured such breach within days of receiving a letter requesting such cure  and there is no dispute as to whether such breach has occurred 
in lieu of terminating the agreement  however  merck can terminate the research program and certain other aspects of the agreement after giving days prior notice if we materially breach our obligations during the course of the program and fail to cure such breach  if such default cannot be cured within such day period  or if we do not commence and diligently continue good faith efforts to cure such default during such period 
the initial term of the research program under our agreement with ortho mcneil is until december   unless extended for an additional year by ortho mcneil or as we may otherwise agree 
we and ortho mcneil each have the right to terminate the agreement early if the other party commits an uncured material breach of its obligations 
further  ortho mcneil may terminate the agreement without cause during the term of the research program  provided that in such event it pays us the balance of its research funding obligation for the initial term of the research program in a lump sum  unless the termination is due to a change of control of arena as defined in the agreement  in which case ortho mcneil may terminate either the agreement or the research program under the agreement  without the payment of additional research funding to us 
at any time after the end of the research program  ortho mcneil may terminate the agreement by providing us at least days prior written notice 
upon termination of the agreement  all rights to the compounds developed under the collaboration will revert to us 
we may have conflicts with our prospective  current or past collaborators that could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our drug candidates 
we may have conflicts with our prospective  current or past collaborators  such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of preclinical or clinical data  the achievement of milestones  or the ownership of intellectual property 
if any conflicts arise with ortho mcneil  merck or any other prospective  current or past collaborator  such collaborator may act in a manner that is adverse to our best interests 
any such disagreement could result in one or more of the following  each of which could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our drug candidates  and in turn prevent us from generating revenues unwillingness on the part of a collaborator to pay us research funding  milestone payments or royalties that we believe are due to us under a collaboration  uncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property rights arising from our collaborative activities  which could prevent us from entering into additional collaborations  unwillingness on the part of a collaborator to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities  or slowing or cessation of a collaborator s development or commercialization efforts with respect to our drug candidates 
drug discovery and development is intensely competitive in the therapeutic areas on which we focus 
if our competitors develop treatments that are approved faster  marketed better or demonstrated to be more effective or safer than our drug candidates  our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated 
we focus our efforts on gpcrs 
because gpcrs are an important target class for drug discovery efforts  we believe that many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other organizations have internal drug discovery programs focused on gpcrs 
many of the drugs that our collaborators or we are attempting to discover and develop would compete with existing therapies 
in addition  many companies are pursuing the development of new drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that we target 
many of our competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater research and development capabilities and greater financial  scientific and human resources than we do 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do for the same indication may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including certain patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights 
in addition  our competitors may develop drugs with fewer side effects  more desirable characteristics such as route of administration or frequency of dosing or greater efficacy than our drug candidates or drugs  if any  for the same indication 
any results from our research and development efforts  or from our joint efforts with our existing or any future collaborators  may not compete successfully with existing or newly discovered products or therapies 
setbacks and consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  and our or our collaborators inability to obtain third party coverage and adequate reimbursement  could make partnering more difficult and diminish our revenues 
setbacks in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  such as those caused by safety concerns relating to high profile drugs like vioxx and celebrex  competition from generic drugs and litigation  and industry consolidation may have an adverse effect on us 
for example  pharmaceutical companies may be less willing to enter into new collaborations or continue existing collaborations if they are integrating a new operation as a result of a merger or acquisition or if their therapeutic areas of focus change following a merger 
moreover  our and our collaborators ability to commercialize future drugs will depend in part on government regulation and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payers  including government payers  such as the medicaid and medicare programs 
government and third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and reimbursement levels for new drugs 
these efforts may limit our commercial opportunities by reducing the amount a potential collaborator is willing to pay to license our programs or drug candidates in the future due to a reduction in the potential revenues from drug sales 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if those parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines  we may not be able to advance our drug candidates in a timely manner or at all 
in the course of our discovery  preclinical testing and clinical trials  we have relied and continue to rely on third parties  including laboratories  investigators  clinical research organizations and manufacturers  to perform critical services for us 
for example  we are relying on contract clinical sites to conduct our clinical trials for apd and apd clinical research organizations are and will continue to be responsible for many aspects of the trials  including finding and enrolling subjects for testing and administering the trials 
these third parties may not be available when we need them or  if they are available  may not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner 
these independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which may compete with us 
as a result of our dependence on third parties  we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control 
these risks also apply to the development activities of our collaborators  and we do not control our collaborators research and development  clinical trials or regulatory activities 
we do not expect any drugs resulting from our collaborators research and development efforts to be commercially available for many years  if ever 
we or a third party manufacturer may encounter a manufacturing failure that could delay the clinical development or regulatory approval of our drug candidates  or their ultimate commercial production if approved 
any performance failure on the part of us or a third party manufacturer could delay clinical development or regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
manufacturers often encounter difficulties involving production yields  regulatory compliance  quality control and quality assurance  as well as shortages of qualified personnel 
we or a third party manufacturer may encounter such difficulties 
the manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda  the drug enforcement administration of the us department of justice and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with current good manufacturing practices and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over a third party manufacturer s compliance with these regulations and standards 
if one of our manufacturers fails to maintain compliance  the production of our drug candidates could be interrupted  resulting in delays  additional costs and potentially lost revenues 
we may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity  increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management 
from time to time we consider strategic transactions  such as acquisitions of companies  asset purchases and out licensing or in licensing of compounds or technologies 
additional potential transactions we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements  including spin offs  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  restructurings  divestitures  business combinations and investments 
any such transaction may require us to incur non recurring or other charges  may increase our near and long term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business  which could harm our operations and financial results 
our efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to retain and attract key employees 
our success depends on the continued contributions of our principal management  development and scientific personnel  and the ability to hire and retain key personnel  particularly in the clinical development area as we transition more of our programs from research into drug development 
we face intense competition for such personnel 
the loss of services of any principal member of our management or scientific staff  particularly jack lief  our president and chief executive officer  and dominic p 
behan  phd  our senior vice president and chief scientific officer  could adversely impact our operations and ability to raise additional capital 
to our knowledge  neither mr 
lief nor dr 
behan plans to leave  retire or otherwise disassociate with us in the near future 
we may encounter significant delays or problems with our chemical development facility 
we have a chemical development facility for process research  the scale up and production of intermediates and other compounds for research and development purposes  and the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients for use in clinical trials 
we may encounter delays and problems in operating our chemical development facility due to governmental approvals  permits and regulation of the facility  accidents during operation of the facility  failure of equipment for the facility  delays in receiving raw materials from suppliers  natural or other disasters  or other factors inherent in operating a complex manufacturing facility 
we may not be able to operate our chemical development facility in a cost effective manner or in a time frame that is consistent with our expected future manufacturing needs 
if this were the case  we would need to seek alternative means to fulfill our manufacturing needs  which could delay progress on our programs 
we use biological materials  hazardous materials  chemicals and radioactive compounds 
our research and development activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment 
these materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our facility pending ultimate use and disposal 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination  which could cause an interruption of our research and development efforts  injury to our employees and others  environmental damage resulting in costly clean up  and liabilities under federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products 
in such an event  we may be held liable for any resulting damages  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
although we carry insurance in amounts and type that we consider commercially reasonable  we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our research and development efforts caused by contamination  and we cannot be certain that the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate 
we may incur substantial liabilities from any product liability claims if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate 
we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in human clinical trials  and will face an even greater risk if we sell drugs commercially 
an individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our drug candidates or drugs causes  or merely appears to have caused  an injury 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against a product liability claim  we will incur substantial liabilities 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for our drug  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial subjects  costs of related litigation  substantial monetary awards to subjects or other claimants  loss of revenues  and the inability to commercialize our drug candidates 
we have limited product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of drugs if marketing approval is obtained for any of our drug candidates 
however  insurance coverage is increasingly expensive 
we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost  and we may not have insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise 
we may incur increased costs as a result of recently enacted changes in laws and regulations relating to corporate governance matters 
changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission and by the nasdaq national market  may result in increased costs to us 
these laws  rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
we cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to their requirements 
our operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event 
our laboratories  offices and chemical development facility are located in the same office park in san diego 
we depend on our facilities and on our collaborators  contractors and vendors for the continued operation of our business 
natural disasters or other catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks  power interruptions  wildfires and other fires  actions of animal rights activists  earthquakes and wars could disrupt our operations or those of our collaborators  contractors and vendors 
even though we believe we carry commercially reasonable business interruption and liability insurance  and our contractors may carry liability insurance  that protect us in certain events  we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our and our contractors insurance policies or for which we or our contractors do not have coverage 
for example  we are not insured against a terrorist attack 
any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results 
moreover  any such event could delay our research and development programs 
even if any of our drug candidates receives regulatory approval  our drug candidates will still be subject to extensive post market regulation 
if we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for our drug candidates  we will also be subject to ongoing fda obligations and continued regulatory review  such as continued safety reporting requirements  and we may also be subject to additional fda post marketing obligations  all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize such drugs 
if any of our drug candidates receive united states regulatory approval  the fda may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses for which such drugs may be marketed or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post approval studies 
in addition  regulatory agencies subject a drug  its manufacturer and the manufacturer s facilities to continual review and inspections 
the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the drug is manufactured  may result in restrictions on the marketing of that drug  and could include withdrawal of the drug from the market 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in issuance of warning letters by the fda  fines and other civil penalties  criminal prosecutions  injunctions  suspensions or revocations of marketing licenses  suspension of any ongoing clinical trials  suspension of manufacturing  delays in commercialization  refusal by the fda to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our collaborators  refusals to permit drugs to be imported or exported to or from the united states  restrictions on operations  including costly new manufacturing requirements  and product recalls or seizures 
the fda s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates or further restrict or regulate post approval activities 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action  either in the united states or abroad 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we might not be permitted to market our drugs and our business could suffer 
in order to market any drugs outside of the united states  we and our collaborators must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy 
approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods 
the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with fda approval as well as additional presently unanticipated risks 
regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another  but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects associated with regulatory approval in the united states  including the risk that our drug candidates may not be approved for all indications requested and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the drug may be marketed 
new accounting pronouncements may impact our future results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
this statement  which is effective in our first quarter of  changes how we account for share based compensation and may negatively impact our stock price 
through december   we accounted for share based payments to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method 
under this method  we generally did not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issued under our equity compensation plans or the discounts we provided under our employee stock purchase plan 
sfas no 
r requires us to recognize share based compensation as compensation expense in the statement of operations based on the fair values of such equity on the date of the grant  with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award 
this statement also requires us to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to share based compensation 
the company plans to use the modified prospective method of recognition of compensation expense related to share based payments 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r is difficult to predict at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  we believe if we had adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce our net operating cash flows and increase our net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
sfas no 
r may also delay when we may become profitable 
future changes in generally accepted accounting principles  including pronouncements relating to revenue recognition  might have a significant effect on our reported results  including reporting of transactions completed before the effective date of such pronouncements  if ever 
risks relating to our intellectual property our success is dependent on intellectual property rights held by us and third parties and our interest in these rights is complex and uncertain 
our success will depend on our own and on our collaborators abilities to obtain  secure and defend patents 
in particular  the patents directed to our most advanced drug candidates and other compounds discovered using our technologies are important to commercializing drugs 
we have numerous us and foreign patent applications pending for our technologies  including patent applications on drug lead discovery techniques using cart  genetically altered gpcrs  gpcrs that we have discovered  new uses for previously discovered gpcrs  and compounds discovered using cart and melanophore and other technologies 
the procedures for obtaining a patent in the us and in most foreign countries are complex 
these procedures require an analysis of the scientific technology related to the invention and many legal issues 
consequently  the analysis of our patent applications will be complex and time consuming 
our patent position is very uncertain and we do not know when  or if  we will obtain additional patents for our technologies 
in addition  other entities may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and patent applications in litigation or administrative proceedings 
even the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability 
we cannot make assurances as to how much protection  if any  will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged 
it is possible that a competitor or a generic pharmaceutical provider may successfully challenge our patents and those challenges may result in reduction in our patents coverage 
as of january   we owned  in part or in whole  or had exclusively licensed the following patents in the united states  in european countries  eight in new zealand  five in australia  five in lebanon  one in japan  one in china  one in singapore  one in hong kong and one in israel 
in addition  as of january   we had approximately patent applications before the united states patent and trademark office  foreign patent offices and international patent authorities 
these patents and patent applications are divided into distinct families of related patents that are directed to cart  melanophore technology  other novel screening methods  chemical compositions of matter  methods of treatment using chemical compositions  or gpcr genes 
one of our patent families was exclusively in licensed and contains a single issued patent 
seven of our patent families containing a total of eight patents and patent applications were the subject of joint inventions by our employees and the employees of other entities 
the remaining patent families  which include a total of patents and patent applications  were invented solely by our employees 
there is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue  or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant drug or method 
in  the united states patent and trademark office began issuing broad patent claims that could allow patent holders to control the use of all drugs that modulate a particular drug target or gpcr  regardless of whether the infringing drug bears any structural resemblance to a chemical compound known to the patent holder at the time of patent filing 
the question of whether these new patent claims are valid is highly controversial and the subject of litigation 
whether we or our competitors are able to obtain and enforce such patent claims  particularly as they apply to the gpcrs that are the subject of our drug development activities  may have a significant impact on our potential revenues from any drugs that we are able to develop 
we also rely on confidentiality agreements and trade secrets to protect our technologies 
however  such information is difficult to protect 
we require our employees to contractually agree not to improperly use our confidential information or disclose it to others  but we may be unable to determine if our employees have conformed or will conform to their legal obligations under these agreements 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with prospective collaborators  collaborators  service providers and consultants  but we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of this information 
many of our employees and consultants were  and many of them may currently be  parties to confidentiality agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and the use of our technologies could violate these agreements 
in addition  third parties may independently discover our trade secrets or proprietary information 
some of our academic institution licensors  research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights 
we generally seek to prevent our partners from disclosing scientific discoveries before we have the opportunity to file patent applications on such discoveries 
in some of our collaborations we do not have control over our partners ability to disclose their own discoveries under the collaboration and in some of our academic collaborations we are limited to relatively short periods to review a proposed publication and file a patent application 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technologies and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations  our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information will be impaired 
a dispute regarding the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be costly and result in delays in our research and development activities 
our commercial success also depends upon our ability to develop and manufacture our drug candidates and market and sell drugs  if any  and conduct our research and development activities without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of other entities 
there are many patents and patent applications filed  and that may be filed  by others relating to drug discovery and development programs that could be determined to be similar  identical or superior to ours or our licensors or collaborators 
we may be exposed to future litigation by other entities based on claims that our drug candidates  technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the area of gpcrs  including some which purport to allow the patent holder to control the use of all drugs that modulate a particular drug target or gpcr  regardless of whether the infringing drug bears any structural resemblance to a chemical compound known to the patent holder at the time of patent filing 
numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others also exist in the therapeutic areas in which we are developing drugs 
these could materially affect our ability to develop our drug candidates or sell drugs  if any  and our activities  or those of our licensors or collaborators  could be determined to infringe these patents 
because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be currently pending applications  unknown to us  which may later result in issued patents that our drug candidates or technologies may infringe 
there also may be existing patents  of which we are not aware  that our drug candidates or technologies may inadvertently infringe 
further  there may be issued patents and pending patent applications in fields relevant to our business  of which we are or may become aware  that we believe we do not infringe or that we believe are invalid or relate to immaterial portions of our overall drug discovery and development efforts 
we cannot assure you that other entities holding any of these patents or patent applications will not assert infringement claims against us for damages or seeking to enjoin our activities 
we also cannot assure you that  in the event of litigation  we will be able to successfully assert any belief we may have as to non infringement  invalidity or immateriality  or that any infringement claims will be resolved in our favor 
in addition  other entities may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights  and we may have to institute costly legal action to protect our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to afford the costs of enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights against other entities 
other organizations  companies and individuals are seeking proprietary positions on genomics information that overlap with the government sponsored project to sequence the human genome 
our activities  or those of our licensors or collaborators  could be affected by conflicting positions that may exist between any overlapping genomics information made available publicly as a result of the government sponsored project and genomics information that other organizations  companies or individuals consider to be proprietary 
there could also be significant litigation and other administrative proceedings in our industry that affect us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
any legal action or administrative action against us  or our collaborators  claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our drug discovery and development programs could require us  or our collaborators  to obtain a license to continue to use  manufacture or market the affected drugs  methods or processes  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  prevent us from importing  making  using  selling or offering to sell the subject matter claimed in patents held by others and subject us to potential liability for damages  consume a substantial portion of our managerial  scientific and financial resources  or be costly  regardless of the outcome 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of pre trial document and witness discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
in addition  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
we have been contacted from time to time by third parties regarding their intellectual property rights  sometimes asserting that we may need a license to use their technologies 
if we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our technologies  we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our drug candidates 
we cannot protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world 
filing  prosecuting and defending patents on all of our drug discovery technologies throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive 
competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own drugs 
these drugs may compete with our drugs  if any  and may not be covered by any of our patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions 
many countries  including certain countries in europe  have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties for example  the patent owner has failed to work the invention in that country or the third party has patented improvements 
in addition  many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors 
in these countries  the patent owner may have limited remedies  which could materially diminish the value of the patent 
compulsory licensing of life saving drugs is also becoming increasingly popular in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives 
such compulsory licenses could be extended to include some of our drug candidates  which could limit our potential revenue opportunities 
moreover  the legal systems of certain countries  particularly certain developing countries  do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection  particularly those relating to biotechnology and or pharmaceuticals  which makes it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents 
proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
risks relating to our securities our stock price will likely be volatile  and your investment in our stock could decline in value 
our stock price has fluctuated historically 
from january   to january   the market price of our stock was as low as per share and as high as per share 
very few biotechnology drug candidates being tested will ultimately receive fda approval  and a biotechnology company may experience a significant drop in its stock price based on an adverse clinical trial result or regulatory action 
our stock price may fluctuate significantly  depending on a variety of factors  including our success or failure in clinical trials  the timing of the discovery of drug leads and the development of our drug candidates  entering into a new collaboration or modifying or terminating an existing collaboration  the timing and receipt by us of milestone and royalty payments or failing to achieve and receive the same  changes in the research and development budgets of our existing or potential collaborators  others introducing new drug discovery techniques or introducing or withdrawing drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that we or our collaborators target  regulatory actions  expenses related to  and the results of  litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights or other matters  and accounting changes  including the expense impact of sfas no 
r 
we are not able to control all of these factors 
period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 
in addition  if our revenues or results of operations in a particular period do not meet stockholders or analysts expectations  our stock price may decline and such decline could be significant 
holders of our series b preferred can require us to redeem their series b preferred 
on december   we completed the private placement to two institutional investors of i an aggregate of  shares of our series b preferred  ii seven year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share subject to weighted average adjustment in certain circumstances and iii unit warrants to purchase for a period of approximately months from december   up to million of our series b preferred and additional seven year warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share subject to weighted average adjustment in certain circumstances 
on april   the investors exercised their unit warrants in full 
the holders of our series b preferred can require us at any time to redeem all or some of their shares of series b preferred at such shares stated value  plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of payment and any applicable penalties 
the stated value is the original holder s investment plus any dividends settled by increasing the stated value at the time the dividend is payable 
the aggregate redemption price of our series b preferred at december   was approximately million  and accrues interest at annually 
the holders of our series b preferred will be entitled to require us to redeem their shares of series b preferred at such shares stated value  plus accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of payment and any applicable penalties if  following the st month anniversary of the original issue date of the series b preferred  the average of the closing prices of our common stock for any consecutive trading days is below  which is the conversion price for the series b preferred 
the aggregate redemption price of our series b preferred at december   was approximately million  and accrues interest at annually 
also  the holders of the series b preferred may require us to redeem their shares if we issue common stock or common stock equivalents for an effective net price to us per share less than approximately excluding  among other things  certain common stock and common stock equivalents issued or issuable i to our officers  directors  employees or consultants  ii in connection with certain strategic partnerships or joint ventures  and iii in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions 
effective net price is not defined in the certificate of designations governing our series b preferred 
the holders of our series b preferred may assert that effective net price should be calculated as the amount we receive after paying any discounts and other expenses related to any such issuance 
at the option of any holder of any series b preferred  any series b preferred held by such holder may be converted into common stock based on the applicable conversion price then in effect for such shares of series b preferred stock 
in addition to the foregoing redemption rights  at any time following the occurrence of a triggering event  a holder of the series b preferred may require us to repurchase all or any portion of the series b preferred then held by such holder at a price per share equal to the greater of of the stated value or the market value as calculated under the certificate of designations for the series b preferred and the series b preferred of such shares of series b preferred plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of payment 
triggering event is specifically defined in the certificate of designations for the series b preferred and the series b preferred  and includes any of the following events i immediately prior to a bankruptcy event  ii we fail for any reason to timely deliver a certificate evidencing any securities to a purchaser or the exercise or conversion rights of the holders are otherwise suspended for other than a permissible reason  iii any of certain events of default as set forth in the registration rights agreement with the series b preferred holders occur and remain uncured for days  iv we fail to make any cash payment required under the series b preferred transaction documents and such failure is not timely cured  v the issuance of a going concern opinion by our independent registered public accounting firm that is not timely cured  vi we breach a section of the series b preferred purchase agreement relating to indebtedness and subordination  or vii we default in the timely performance of any other obligation under the series b preferred transaction documents and such default is not timely cured 
we will also be required to redeem any shares of the series b preferred that remain outstanding on the fifth anniversary of their issuance at a price equal to the amount of the original holder s original investment  plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon to the date of such payment 
if we are required to redeem all or some of the currently outstanding shares of our series b preferred  we may be able to pay a portion of the redemption price using shares of our common stock if certain enumerated conditions are satisfied  including we have sufficient number of shares of common stock available for issuance  the shares of common stock to be issued are registered under an effective registration statement or are otherwise available for sale under rule k under the securities act  our common stock is listed on the nasdaq national market or other eligible market  the shares to be issued can be issued without violating the rules of the nasdaq national market or any applicable trading market or a provision of our certificate of designations  and no bankruptcy event has occurred 
if we are permitted to satisfy a portion of a redemption by using shares of our common stock  and if we elect to do so  the number of shares to be issued to holders of series b preferred will be determined by dividing their cash redemption price by the lesser of the conversion price or of the average of the volume weighted average price of our common stock for either or trading days 
there can be no assurance that if we have to redeem our series b preferred  that we will be able to pay a portion of the redemption price using shares of our common stock 
if we use common stock to redeem a portion of the series b preferred  your ownership interest may be significantly diluted 
if we are required or elect to redeem shares of the series b preferred using cash  we may not have sufficient cash to redeem these shares or to continue our planned research and discovery activities 
in such event we may try to raise additional capital by issuing new stock  but there can be no assurance that capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
there are a substantial number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market  and the sale of these shares could cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
there were  shares of our common stock outstanding as of february  the outstanding shares of our series b preferred are convertible into up to  shares of common stock at per share of common stock 
the outstanding shares of our series b preferred are convertible into up to  shares of common stock at per share of common stock 
holders of series b preferred are entitled to receive a annual dividend that is payable by issuing common stock or by increasing the amount of common stock that is issuable upon conversion of the series b preferred 
in addition  holders of our series b preferred own warrants to acquire common stock  which  if exercised and converted  would obligate us to issue up to  additional shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
if the closing price of our common stock is equal to or above for consecutive trading days  upon trading days prior written notice  we will have the right to  and the warrant holders will have the right to require us to  call and cancel any unexercised portion of the warrants subject to certain conditions 
upon exercise of a warrant following such call notice and prior to the warrant cancellation date  we will be obligated to issue to the warrant holder an exchange warrant entitling the holder to purchase shares of our common stock equal to the amount of the holder s warrant that was called 
this exchange warrant will contain the same terms and conditions as the original warrant  except that the maturity date will be seven years from the date of issuance of such exchange warrant and the exercise price will be equal to of the average of the volume weighted average prices of our common stock for the five trading days preceding the original warrant cancellation date 
in addition  as of february   there were  common stock options issued and outstanding under our equity compensation plans at a weighted average exercise price of   additional shares of common stock issuable under our equity compensation plans   shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan and  shares issuable under our deferred compensation plan 
a substantial number of the shares described above  when issued upon exercise  will be available for immediate resale in the public market 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of such resales due to the increased number of shares available for sale in the market 
any future equity or debt issuances by us may have dilutive or adverse effects on our existing stockholders 
we have financed our operations  and we expect to continue to finance our operations  primarily by issuing and selling our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock 
in light of our need for additional financing  we may issue additional shares of common stock or additional convertible securities that could dilute your ownership in our company and may include terms that give new investors rights that are superior to yours 
moreover  any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the terms of our series b preferred limit our ability to engage in certain equity issuances 
we may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt  and the holders of any debt we may issue would have rights superior to your rights in the event we are not successful and are forced to seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws 
the terms of our series b preferred limits our ability to incur debt 
our largest stockholders may take actions that are contrary to your interests  including selling their stock 
a small number of our stockholders hold a significant amount of our outstanding stock 
these stockholders may support competing transactions and have interests that are different from yours 
in addition  the average number of shares of our stock that trade each day is generally low 
as a result  sales of a large number of shares of our stock by these large stockholders or other stockholders within a short period of time could adversely affect our stock price 
provisions of our series b preferred may prevent or make it more difficult for us to raise funds or take certain other actions 
provisions of our series b preferred require us to obtain approval of the preferred stockholders  or otherwise trigger rights of first refusal or payment provisions  to i offer or sell new securities  other than in specified underwritten offerings or strategic partnerships or joint venture and certain other exceptions  ii sell or issue common stock or securities issuable into common stock below certain prices  iii incur debt or allow liens on our property  other than certain permitted debt and liens  iv amend our certificate of incorporation so as to affect adversely any rights of the preferred stockholders  v authorize or create a new class of stock that will be senior or equal to the series b preferred in terms of dividends  redemption or distribution of assets  vi use more than million in cash for acquisitions  or vii take certain other actions 
these provisions may make it more difficult for us to take certain corporate actions and could delay  discourage or prevent future financings 
our rights agreement and certain provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interest 
we have adopted certain anti takeover provisions  including a stockholders rights plan  dated as of october   between us and computershare trust company  inc  as rights agent  as amended on december  the rights plan will cause substantial dilution to any person who attempts to acquire us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights agreement and certificate of designations for the series b preferred  as well as other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws and under delaware law  could delay or prevent the removal of directors and other management and could make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us that you may consider to be in your best interest 
for example  these provisions allow our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  limit who can call a special meeting of stockholders  eliminate stockholder action by written consent  and establish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be acted upon at stockholders meetings 
item properties 
the facilities that we occupy consist of approximately  square feet of research  development  warehouse and office space located at    and nancy ridge drive  san diego  california 
at our nancy ridge drive facility  we lease approximately  square feet of space  of which  square feet is laboratory space and  square feet is office space 
in  we purchased the nancy ridge drive facility  which is approximately  square feet of space  consisting of  square feet of laboratory space and  square feet of office space 
in december  we completed a sale and leaseback of the nancy ridge drive facility
