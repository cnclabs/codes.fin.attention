item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of psb should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of psb  including the related notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
certain statements in this document may be considered to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the us private securities litigation reform act of  such as statements that 
table of contents include the words may  believes  expect  estimate  project  anticipate  should  would  intend  probability  risk  target  objective and similar expressions or variations on such expressions 
the forward looking statements contained herein are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
for example  risks and uncertainties can arise with changes in general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  business conditions in the financial services industry  the regulatory environment  including evolving banking industry standards  rapidly changing technology and competition with community  regional and national financial institutions  new service and product offerings by competitors  price pressures  and similar items 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis only as of the date hereof 
psb undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
readers should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents psb files from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including psb s annual report on form k for the year ended december   quarterly reports on form q filed by psb in and any current reports on form k filed by the company  as well as similar filings in general psb s results of operations depend primarily on the bank s net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  and interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
its interest earning assets consist primarily of loans receivable  investment securities  and interest earning deposits while its interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits 
the bank s net income is also affected by its provision for loan losses and its level of non interest income as well as by its non interest expense  such as salary and employee benefits  occupancy costs  and charges relating to non performing and other classified assets 
impact of inflation the financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the bank is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the bank and its subsidiaries conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap applicable to the financial services industry 
all significant inter company transactions are eliminated in consolidation and certain reclassifications are made when necessary to conform the previous year s financial statements to the current year s presentation 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenditures for the periods presented 
therefore  actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
allowance for credit losses psb uses the reserve method of accounting for credit losses 
the balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s review and evaluation of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions  and other pertinent factors  including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for loan losses 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged 
table of contents against the allowance for loan losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
while management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate based on information currently available  future additions to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses and management s intent with regard to the disposition of loans and leases 
in addition  the regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review psb s allowance for loan losses 
the regulators may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
income taxes under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
based upon the review of all components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  future taxable income of psb and regulatory guidelines  management has determined that no allowance is deemed necessary at december  however  circumstances could arise that would require management to revisit the need for such an allowance 
performance overview results of operations net income for was million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for and million or per diluted share for these decreases are a result of declining net interest margins and increases in non interest expenses 
detail regarding changes in each of these areas follows 
net interest income net interest income is a primary source of revenue for the bank 
this income results from the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits to customers and other non deposit sources of funds  such as repurchase agreements 
net interest margin is the difference between the interest income on earning assets and the interest expense on interest bearing funds as a percentage of earning assets 
during   and  the bank had no tax exempt sources of revenue 
all discussion of net interest margin is on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
net interest income for was million  a decrease over the million of net interest income in  which was a increase over the million of net interest income in average earning assets increased by million or from to the net interest margin decreased to in from in net interest margin decreased during generally because of the flatter yield curve that existed in and specifically because of an increase in time deposit average balances and an increase in the interest rate percentage paid on these time deposits

management has targeted the loan portfolio as a key to the bank s continuing growth 
specifically  the bank has shifted its lending focus to higher yielding commercial loans made to small and medium sized businesses in its market area 
in order to facilitate growth in commercial lending  the bank assessed its loan staff and made significant personnel changes in senior management positions to assure its continued success in the development of this lending group 
management has also implemented changes within the credit administration division of the commercial lending group to ensure continued high quality underwriting standards are maintained 
additionally  the bank has committed to an increase of at least two new experienced loan officers during the next twelve months servicing this area 
a significant increase in the volume of commercial and construction loans during underscores that focus as the commercial portfolio increased to million at december   from million at december   an increase of million or

table of contents provision and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses for was  compared to  in and  in the bank performs a review of the credit quality of its loan portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses at december   was million  or of outstanding loans  compared to million or of outstanding loans at december  the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes to be adequate to absorb potential losses in the loan portfolio 
additions to the allowance are charged through the provision for loan losses 
management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance by performing an ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio  including such factors as charge off history  the level of delinquent loans  the current financial condition of specific borrowers  value of any collateral  risk characteristics in the loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
significant loans are individually analyzed  while other smaller balance loans are evaluated by loan category 
based upon the results of such reviews  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december   was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date 
the following table sets forth an allocation for the allowance for loan losses by category

as a matter of policy  the accrual of loan interest is discontinued if management believes that  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest becomes doubtful 
this is normally done when a loan reaches days delinquent 
at this time  all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed out of interest income 
there are occasional exceptions if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection

the ability of the bank to attract and maintain deposits and the bank s cost of funds on these deposit accounts have been  and will continue to be  significantly affected by economic and competitive conditions 
borrowed funds the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank system fhlb 
the fhlb provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions 
the bank  as a member of the fhlb of pittsburgh  is required to hold shares of common stock in that fhlb in an amount at least equal to of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans  home purchase contracts  and similar obligations at the beginning of each year  or of its advances borrowings from the fhlb of pittsburgh  whichever is greater 
the bank had a million investment in the stock of the fhlb at december   which was in compliance with this requirement 
at december  and  the bank had no outstanding borrowings from the fhlb of pittsburgh 
the bank has a line of credit available in the amount of million as of december  borrowed funds from various sources are generally used to supplement deposit growth

table of contents shareholders equity total shareholders equity at december  and increased by million and million  respectively to million and million includes accumulated other comprehensive income  which includes an adjustment for the fair value of the bank s securities portfolio 
this amount attempts to identify the impact to equity in the unlikely event that the bank s entire securities portfolio would be liquidated under current economic conditions 
the amounts and types of securities held by the bank at the end of  combined with current interest rates  resulted in a decrease in equity  net of taxes  of million 
this compares with an decrease in equity  net of taxes  of  at the end of retained earnings accounted for an increase in shareholders equity of million and million during and  respectively 
interest rate sensitivity through the years  the banking industry has adapted to an environment in which interest rates have fluctuated dramatically and in which depositors have been provided with liquid  rate sensitive investment options 
the industry utilizes a process known as asset liability management as a means of managing this adaptation 
asset liability management is intended to provide for adequate liquidity and interest rate sensitivity by matching interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and coordinating maturities and repricing characteristics on assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities are matched 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and earnings volatility due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
the bank s net interest income is affected by changes in the level of market interest rates 
in order to maintain consistent earnings performance  the bank seeks to manage  to the extent possible  the repricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities 
one major objective of the bank when managing the rate sensitivity of its assets and liabilities is to stabilize net interest income 
the management of and authority to assume interest rate risk is the responsibility of the bank s asset liability committee alco  which is comprised of senior management and board members 
the alco meets quarterly to monitor the ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities 
the process to review interest rate risk management is a regular part of management of the bank 
in addition  there is an annual process to review the interest rate risk policy with the board of directors which includes limits on the impact to earnings from shifts in interest rates 
to manage the interest rate sensitivity position  an asset liability model called gap analysis is used to monitor the difference in the volume of the bank s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that mature or reprice within given periods 
a positive gap asset sensitive indicates that more assets reprice during a given period compared to liabilities  while a negative gap liability sensitive has the opposite effect 
at december   the bank maintained a positive one to five year cumulative gap

although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
management also simulates possible economic conditions and interest rate scenarios in order to quantify the impact on interest income 
the effect that changing interest rates have on psb s net interest income is simulated by increasing and decreasing interest rates 
this simulation is known as rate shocking

the measurements which incorporate the varying degrees of risk contained within the balance sheet and exposure to off balance sheet commitments were established to provide a framework for comparing different institutions 
the bank is not aware of any pending recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have a material impact on the bank s capital  resources  or liquidity if they were implemented  nor is the bank under any agreements with any regulatory authorities 
the adequacy of the bank s capital is reviewed on an ongoing basis with regard to size  composition and quality of the bank s resources 
an adequate capital base is important for continued growth and expansion in addition to providing an added protection against unexpected losses 
as required by the federal banking regulatory authorities  guidelines have been adopted to measure capital adequacy 
under the guidelines  certain minimum ratios are required for core capital and total capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets and other off balance sheet instruments 
for the bank  tier i capital consists of common shareholders equity less intangible assets  and tier ii capital includes the allowable portion of the allowance for loan losses  currently limited to of risk weighted assets 
by regulatory guidelines  the separate component of equity for unrealized appreciation or depreciation on available for sale securities is excluded from tier i capital

liquidity and funds management liquidity management ensures that adequate funds will be available to meet anticipated and unanticipated deposit withdrawals  debt servicing payments  investment securities purchase commitments  commercial and consumer loan demand and ongoing operating expenses 
funding sources include principal repayments on loans and investment securities  sales of loans  growth in core deposits  short and long term borrowings and repurchase agreements 
regular loan payments are a dependable source of funds  while the sale of loans and investment securities  deposit flows  and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and level of interest rates 
at december   the bank maintained million in cash and cash equivalents primarily consisting of cash and due from banks 
in addition  the bank had million in securities available for sale 
the combined total of million represented of total assets at december  the bank considers its primary source of liquidity to be its core deposit base  which includes non interest bearing and interest bearing demand  and savings deposits 
this funding source consists of deposits from customers throughout the branch network 
the bank will continue to promote the growth of deposits through its branch offices 
at december   approximately of the bank s assets were funded by core deposits acquired within its market area 
the bank s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
these commitments consist mainly of unfunded loans and letters of credit made under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
unused commitments  at december  totaled million 
this consisted of million in commercial real estate and construction loans  million in home equity lines of credit  million in standby letters of credit and million in other unused commitments 
because these instruments have fixed maturity dates  and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon  they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to the bank 
any amounts actually drawn upon  management believes  can be funded in the normal course of operations 
the bank has no investment in or financial relationship with any unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of capital resources
