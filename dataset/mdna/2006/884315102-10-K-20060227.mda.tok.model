item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview introduction thomas betts corporation is a leading designer and manufacturer of electrical connectors and components used in industrial  commercial  communications  and utility markets 
we are also a leading producer of commercial heating units and highly engineered steel structures used for  among other things  utility transmission 
we operate in approximately countries 
manufacturing  marketing and sales activities are concentrated primarily in north america and europe 
we have benefited from generally improved conditions in our key end markets 
favorable market conditions and focused business strategies have helped us realize solid sales  earnings and cash flow growth 
our businesses are volume sensitive  and given the competitive nature of our markets  it is essential that we offer a strong value proposition to our customers and continually improve our unit costs and operating efficiencies 
in addition to favorable market conditions  our sales growth has benefited from our broad portfolio of quality brands and products  excellent customer service  integrated information systems  and by being fast and flexible in meeting customer needs 
we have successfully managed volatile and rising prices in key commodity markets and driven earnings growth through higher sales  improved operating efficiencies and disciplined cost control 
was a successful year for thomas betts  with each of our businesses experiencing strong sales and earnings improvement 
consolidated net sales grew compared to driven primarily by stronger demand in most of our end markets 
the improvement in earnings from operations over reflects the impact of higher sales volume  improved fixed cost absorption and our success in managing the impact of higher material and energy costs 
cash flow from operating activities was million in up from million in reflecting higher operating earnings and a strong focus on working capital management ie  receivables  inventory and accounts payable 
looking forward  we have a strong business platform to continue to pursue organic growth and the balance sheet flexibility to invest in our businesses and consider selective value based acquisitions that fit our core strengths 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements contained in this report requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain amounts reported as net sales  costs  expenses  assets or liabilities and certain amounts disclosed as contingent assets or liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue when finished products are shipped to unaffiliated customers and both title and risks of ownership are transferred 
sales discounts  quantity and price rebates  and allowances are estimated based on contractual commitments and experience and recorded in the period as a reduction of revenue in which the sale is recognized 
quantity rebates are in the form of volume incentive discount plans  which include specific sales volume targets or year over year sales volume growth targets for specific customers 
certain distributors can take advantage of price rebates by subsequently reselling the corporation s products into targeted construction projects or markets 
following a distributor s sale of an eligible product  the distributor submits a claim for a price rebate 
the corporation provides additional allowances for bad page of 
table of contents debts when circumstances dictate 
a number of distributors  primarily in the electrical segment  have the right to return goods under certain circumstances and those returns  which are reasonably estimable  are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time of shipment 
management analyzes historical returns and allowances  current economic trends and specific customer circumstances when evaluating the adequacy of accounts receivable related reserves and accruals 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  the corporation periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventories 
the corporation also periodically performs an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items 
such evaluations are based on management s judgment and use of estimates 
such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on hand  aging of the inventory  sales forecasts for particular product groupings  planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires a transitional and annual test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets associated with reporting units for indications of impairment 
the corporation performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 each test of goodwill requires the corporation to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the corporation must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill as of the assessment date 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
long lived assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
for purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets  the corporation evaluates assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for associated product groups 
the corporation reviews long lived assets to be held and used for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset in the associated product groups is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are considered to be impaired 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
when fair values are not available  the corporation estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
pension and postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
for purposes of calculating pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs  the page of 
table of contents corporation uses certain actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these assumptions annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors retirement patterns  mortality and turnover  rate of compensation increase and the healthcare cost trend rate 
see additional information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations qualified pension plans 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and provides a valuation allowance based on a more likely than not criteria 
the corporation has valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deferred state income tax assets 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the corporation s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and  if necessary  execution of its tax planning strategies 
management believes that it is more likely than not that future taxable income  based on enacted tax law in effect as of december   will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies  which involve estimates and uncertainties  in making this assessment 
tax planning strategies include primarily sales of non core assets 
projected future taxable income is based on management s forecast of the operating results of the corporation 
management periodically reviews such forecasts in comparison with actual results and expected trends 
in the event management determines that sufficient future taxable income  in light of tax planning strategies  may not be generated to fully realize net deferred tax assets  the corporation will increase valuation allowances by a charge to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
likewise  if management determines that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets  the corporation will decrease the existing valuation allowance by recording a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
environmental costs environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based on evaluations of current available facts related to each site 
outlook we believe that we will continue to see solid underlying demand in industrial  commercial and utility markets in given this  we expect mid single digit sales growth driven primarily by volume and earnings per diluted share in the range of to for the full year our outlook assumes an effective tax rate of and includes a charge of approximately per diluted share from the adoption of statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the key risks we may face in include continued higher prices and volatility in commodity markets for our raw materials  and the potential negative impact of rising energy costs and higher interest rates on capital spending in the markets we serve

at times  we may enter into various derivative instruments to manage certain of these risks 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and use a combination of fixed and floating rate debt to manage this exposure
