item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation income taxes 
we have not engaged in any material research activities related to the development of new products or services during the last two fiscal years 
however  our officers and employees are continually searching for ways to increase public convenience  enhance public access to the electronic payments system  and enable us to improve our competitive position 
in  for example  we researched health savings accounts and began offering them to customers  implemented a gift card product  and opened a new branch in the city of reedley 
in january of  we converted our core bank processing and online banking systems to increase efficiency and improve customer service 
during we began offering lease financing as an alternative to loans and implemented an extensive customer service training program  among other things 
and  in the bank brought its item processing function in house and simultaneously implemented check imaging  enabling us to take full advantage of electronic check image collection and presentment as the adoption of this technology becomes increasingly popular 
the cost to the bank for these development  operations  and marketing activities cannot be specifically calculated with any degree of certainty 

table of contents we hold no patents or licenses other than licenses required by appropriate bank regulatory agencies  franchises  or concessions 
our business has a modest seasonal component due to the heavy agricultural orientation of the central valley 
as our branches in more metropolitan areas such as fresno and bakersfield have expanded  however  the agriculture related base has become less important 
we are not dependent on a single customer or group of related customers for a material portion of our deposits  nor is a material portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries 
the amounts expended on compliance with new government and regulatory initiatives related to anti terrorism  corporate responsibility  and customer privacy have not been insignificant 
however  as far as can be reasonably determined there has been no material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position as a result of federal  state  or local environmental regulation 
recent developments as noted in the previous section  the bank s reit was dissolved in november this dissolution did not have a material impact on the financial operations of the company  nor is it expected to have any impact going forward 
in december  the company sold million of its investment securities at a loss of approximately  the proceeds from the sale have been reinvested in higher yielding bonds with longer maturities and less negative convexity 
none of the traded securities were part of the leverage strategy that was implemented in april in the fourth quarter of  the company decided to charge off a million unsecured commercial loan that had been placed on non accrual status in the first quarter 
the decision to charge off this credit was made because of deterioration in the borrower s state of affairs  which created a high degree of uncertainty with regard to the timing and amount of any future payments 
we are still  however  vigorously pursuing the collection of this credit 
since a full reserve had already been provided  the charge off did not have any further impact on our income statement 
recent accounting pronouncements information on recent accounting pronouncements is contained in footnote to the financial statements 
competition the banking business in california in general  and specifically in many of our market areas  is highly competitive with respect to virtually all products and services and has become increasingly more so in recent years 
the industry continues to consolidate  and unregulated competitors have entered banking markets with products targeted at highly profitable customer segments 
many largely unregulated competitors are able to compete across geographic boundaries  and provide customers with meaningful alternatives to nearly all significant banking services and products 
these competitive trends are likely to continue 
with respect to commercial bank competitors  the business is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks that operate a large number of offices within our geographic footprint 
for the combined tulare  kern  fresno  and kings county region  the four counties within which the company operates  the top seven institutions are all multi billion dollar entities with an aggregate of offices that control a combined of deposit market share based on june  fdic market share data 
bank of the sierra ranks eighth with a share of total deposits 
in tulare county  however  where the bank was originally formed  we rank first for total number of branch locations  and second for deposit market share with of total deposits  behind only bank of america 
the largest portion of deposits in the combined four county area also belongs to bank of america  followed by wells fargo and washington mutual 
union bank of california  fremont investment loan  citibank  and bank of the west round out the top seven 
these banks have  among other advantages  the ability to finance wide ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their resources to regions of highest yield and demand 
they can also offer certain services that we do not offer directly but may offer indirectly through correspondent institutions 
by virtue of their greater total capitalization  these banks also have substantially higher lending limits than do smaller community banks 
for customers whose needs exceed our legal lending limit  we arrange for the sale  or participation  of some of the balances to financial institutions that are not within our geographic footprint 

table of contents in addition to other banks  our competitors include savings institutions  credit unions  and numerous non banking institutions such as finance companies  leasing companies  insurance companies  brokerage firms  and investment banking firms 
in recent years  increased competition has also developed from specialized companies that offer wholesale finance  credit card  and other consumer finance services  including on line banking services and personal financial software 
strong competition for deposit and loan products affects interest rates and other terms on which they are offered to customers 
mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on other banks within the industry to remain competitive by streamlining their operations  reducing expenses  and increasing revenues 
competition has also intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws enacted in the mid s  which permit banking organizations to expand into other states 
the relatively large and expanding california market has been particularly attractive to out of state institutions 
the financial modernization act  effective march  see regulation and supervision financial modernization act  has made it possible for full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial companies  and has also intensified competitive conditions 
our credit card business is subject to an even higher level of competitive pressure than our general banking business 
there are a number of major banks and credit card issuers that are able to finance highly visible and extremely successful advertising campaigns with which community banks generally do not have the resources to compete 
as a result  our credit card accounts and outstanding balances are likely to increase at a slower rate than for nationwide issuers 
additional competition comes from many non financial institutions  such as retailers that offer credit cards 
technological innovations have also resulted in increased competition in financial services markets 
such innovation has  for example  made it possible for non depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously were considered traditional banking products 
in addition  many customers now expect a choice of delivery channels  including telephone  mail  home computer  atms  self service branches  and or in store branches 
competitors offering such products include traditional banks as well as savings associations  credit unions  brokerage firms  asset management groups  finance and insurance companies  internet only financial intermediaries  and mortgage banking firms 
for years we have countered rising competition by offering a broad array of products in an innovative and flexible manner 
we are able to offer our customers community oriented  personalized service that cannot always be matched by the major banks 
we rely on local promotional activity  personal contacts by our officers  directors  employees  and shareholders  and individualized service provided through accommodative policies 
this approach appears to be well received by the populace of the san joaquin valley  who appreciate a high touch  customer oriented environment in which to conduct their financial transactions 
other competitive advantages include our retention of drive up teller windows  which have been eliminated by much of the competition  and our preferred lender or plp status with the small business administration  which enables us to approve sba loans faster than many of our competitors 
layered on top of the company s traditional personal contact banking philosophy are sophisticated telephone banking  internet banking  and online bill payment capabilities  which were initiated to meet the needs of customers with electronic access requirements and provide automated hour banking 
this high tech and high touch approach allows individuals to customize access to the company to their particular preference 
employees as of december  the company had full time and part time employees 
on a full time equivalent basis  the company s staffing stood at at december   as compared to at december  staff was added during primarily for the new office in reedley 
regulation and supervision the company and the bank are subject to significant regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies 
the following discussion of statutes and regulations is only a brief summary and does not purport to be complete 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations 
no assurance can be given that such statutes or regulations will not change in the future 

table of contents the company the company s stock is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol bsrr  and as such the company is subject to nasdaq rules and regulations including those related to corporate governance 
the company is also subject to the periodic reporting requirements of section of the securities exchange act of the exchange act which requires the company to file annual  quarterly and other current reports with the securities and exchange commission the sec 
the company is subject to additional regulations including  but not limited to  the proxy and tender offer rules promulgated by the sec under sections and of the exchange act  the reporting requirements of directors  executive officers and principal shareholders regarding transactions in the company s common stock and short swing profits rules promulgated by the sec under section of the exchange act  and certain additional reporting requirements by principal shareholders of the company promulgated by the sec under section of the exchange act 
as a publicly traded company which had more than million in public float as of june   the company is classified as an accelerated filer 
in addition to accelerated time frames for filing sec periodic reports  this also means that the company is subject to the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of with regard to documenting  testing  and attesting to internal controls over financial reporting 
the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of and is registered as such with the federal reserve board 
a bank holding company is required to file with the federal reserve board annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries 
it is also subject to periodic examination by the federal reserve board and is required to obtain federal reserve board approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if  after such acquisition  it would directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock of that bank 
the federal reserve board has by regulation determined certain activities in which a bank holding company may or may not conduct business 
a bank holding company must engage  with certain exceptions  in the business of banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks 
the permissible activities and affiliations of certain bank holding companies were expanded in by the financial modernization act 
see financial modernization act below 
the company and the bank are deemed to be affiliates of each other within the meaning set forth in the federal reserve act and are subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
this means  for example  that there are limitations on loans by the bank to affiliates  and that all affiliate transactions must satisfy certain limitations and otherwise be on terms and conditions at least as favorable to the bank as would be available for non affiliates 
the federal reserve board has a policy that bank holding companies must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks 
it is the federal reserve bank s position that bank holding companies should stand ready to use their available resources to provide adequate capital to their subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity 
bank holding companies should also maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting their subsidiary banks 
the federal reserve board also has the authority to regulate bank holding company debt  including the authority to impose interest rate ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt 
under certain circumstances  the federal reserve board may require the company to file written notice and obtain its approval prior to purchasing or redeeming the company s equity securities 
the bank as a california state chartered bank whose accounts are insured by the fdic up to a maximum of  per depositor  the bank is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the california department of financial institutions the dfi and the fdic 
in addition  while the bank is not a member of the federal reserve system  it is subject to certain regulations of the federal reserve board 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the bank s business  including the making of periodic reports by the bank  and the bank s activities relating to dividends  investments  loans  borrowings  capital requirements  certain check clearing activities  
table of contents branching  mergers and acquisitions  reserves against deposits and numerous other areas 
supervision and examination of the bank by the fdic and any legal actions taken by the fdic with respect thereto are generally intended to protect depositors and are not intended for the protection of shareholders 
the earnings and growth of the bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
as a result  the bank s performance is influenced by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and the policies of the regulatory agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by means of open market operations in united states government securities  adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements  and varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks that are members of the federal reserve system 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates on loans and deposits 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
capital adequacy requirements the company and the bank are subject to the regulations of the federal reserve board and the fdic  respectively  governing capital adequacy 
each of the federal regulators has established risk based and leverage capital guidelines for the banks or bank holding companies it regulates  which set total capital requirements and define capital in terms of core capital elements  or tier capital  and supplemental capital elements  or tier capital 
tier capital is generally defined as the sum of the core capital elements less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on available for sale investment securities carried at fair market value 
the following items are defined as core capital elements i common shareholders equity  ii qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not to exceed of tier capital plus goodwill  and iii minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries 
at december   approximately one fourth of the company s tier capital consisted of trust preferred securities  however no assurance can be given that trust preferred securities will continue to be treated as tier capital in the future 
tier capital can include i allowance for loan and lease losses but not more than of an institution s risk weighted assets  ii perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not qualifying as core capital  iii hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt instruments  and iv term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock and related surplus but not more than of tier capital 
the maximum amount of tier capital that may be recognized for risk based capital purposes is limited to of tier capital  net of goodwill 
the minimum required ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk weighted assets is total risk based capital ratio  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital  and the minimum required ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets is tier risk based capital ratio 
risk based capital ratios are calculated to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under risk based capital guidelines  the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as unsecured loans 
as of december  and  bank only total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  and the bank s tier risk based capital ratios were and 
as of december  and  the consolidated company s total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  and its tier risk based capital ratios were and 
the risk based capital requirements also take into account concentrations of credit involving collateral or loan type  and the risks of non traditional activities those that have not customarily been part of the banking business 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards  and authorize the regulators to review an institution s management of such risks in assessing an institution s capital adequacy 

table of contents additionally  the regulatory statements of policy on risk based capital regulations include exposure to interest rate risk as a factor that the regulators will consider in evaluating a bank s capital adequacy  although interest rate risk does not impact the calculation of a bank s risk based capital ratios 
interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and equity capital to unfavorable changes resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
while interest risk is inherent in a bank s role as financial intermediary  it introduces volatility to earnings and to the economic value of the bank 
the fdic and the federal reserve board also require the calculation of a leverage capital ratio to supplement risk based capital guidelines 
banks and bank holding companies that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks and are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of tier capital net of all intangibles to adjusted total assets leverage capital ratio of at least 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of to 
pursuant to federal regulations  banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed  including the volume and severity of problem loans  and federal regulators may set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant 
bank only leverage capital ratios were and on december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the consolidated company s leverage capital ratios were and  respectively  exceeding regulatory minimums 
for more information on the company s capital  see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation capital resources 
risk based capital ratio requirements are discussed in greater detail in the following section 
prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of  or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio of less than  or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
as of december  and  the bank was deemed to be well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 
at each successively lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations 
for example  a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would make the bank undercapitalized 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks  which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements including a guarantee by the parent holding company  if any 
significantly undercapitalized banks are subject to broad regulatory authority  including among other things  capital directives  forced mergers  restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits  restrictions on asset growth and activities  and prohibitions on paying bonuses or increasing compensation to senior executive officers without fdic approval 
even more severe restrictions apply to critically undercapitalized banks 
most importantly  except under limited circumstances  not later than days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of 
table of contents any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a bank  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines relate to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan underwriting and documentation  compensation and interest rate exposure 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted 
premiums for deposit insurance the fdic regulations also implement a risk based premium system  whereby insured depository institutions are required to pay insurance premiums depending on their risk classification 
under this system  insured banks are categorized into one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized and one of three supervisory categories based on federal regulatory evaluations 
the three supervisory categories are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses group a  demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration group b  and poses a substantial probability of loss group c 
the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same in the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
the current base assessment rates expressed as cents per of deposits are summarized as follows group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized in general  while the fdic s bank insurance fund bif maintains a reserve ratio of or greater  no deposit insurance premiums are required 
if the bif reserve ratio were to fall below that level  all insured banks would be required to pay premiums 
in february  the fdic reform act of was signed into law 
included in this legislation are provisions to merge the bif and the savings association insurance fund into one fund the deposit insurance fund  increase insurance coverage for retirement accounts to  and index deposit insurance levels for inflation 
in addition  banks must pay an amount toward the retirement of financing corporation bonds issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
this amount fluctuates but for the first quarter of is cents per of insured deposits 
community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain requirements under the community reinvestment act cra 
the cra generally requires federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra further requires the agencies to consider a financial institution s efforts in meeting its community credit needs when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in measuring a bank s compliance with its cra obligations  the regulators utilize a performance based evaluation system 
they determine cra ratings based on the bank s actual lending  service  and investment activities  rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the fdic assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
the bank was last examined for cra compliance in july when it received a satisfactory assessment rating 

table of contents other consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations 
examination and enforcement has become intense  and banks have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and regulations 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
in addition to cra and fair lending requirements  the bank is subject to numerous other federal consumer protection statutes and regulations 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities it serves 
interstate banking and branching the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act regulates the interstate activities of banks and bank holding companies and establishes a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
since june   a bank has generally been permitted to merge with a bank in another state without the need for explicit state law authorization 
however  states were given the ability to prohibit interstate mergers with banks in their own state by opting out enacting state legislation applying equality to all out of state banks prohibiting such mergers prior to june  since  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies have been permitted to acquire banks located in any state  subject to two exceptions first  any state may still prohibit bank holding companies from acquiring a bank which is less than five years old  and second  no interstate acquisition can be consummated by a bank holding company if the acquirer would control more than of the deposits held by insured depository institutions nationwide or percent or more of the deposits held by insured depository institutions in any state in which the target bank has branches 
a bank may establish and operate de novo branches in any state in which the bank does not already maintain a branch if that state has enacted legislation to expressly permit all out of state banks to establish branches in that state 
in california enacted legislation to implement important provisions of the interstate banking act discussed above and to repeal california s previous interstate banking laws  which were largely preempted by the interstate banking act 
the changes effected by interstate banking act and california laws have increased competition in the environment in which the bank operates to the extent that out of state financial institutions directly or indirectly enter the bank s market areas 
it appears that the interstate banking act has contributed to accelerated consolidation within the banking industry 
financial modernization act effective march   the gramm leach bliley act also known as the financial modernization act enabled full affiliations to occur between banks and securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers 
this legislation permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby acquire securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized and well managed under applicable definitions  and has at least a satisfactory rating under the cra  by filing a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company 
no regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company  other than a bank or savings association  engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature  as determined by the federal reserve board 
the company has no current intention of becoming a financial holding company  but may do at some point in the future if deemed appropriate in view of opportunities or circumstances at the time 

table of contents the financial modernization act defines financial in nature to include securities underwriting  dealing and market making  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency  merchant banking activities  and activities that the board has determined to be closely related to banking 
a national bank and therefore  a state bank as well may also engage  subject to limitations on investment  in activities that are financial in nature  other than insurance underwriting  insurance company portfolio investment  real estate development and real estate investment  through a financial subsidiary of the bank  if the bank is well capitalized  well managed and has at least a satisfactory cra rating 
subsidiary banks of a financial holding company or national banks with financial subsidiaries must continue to be well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions  which could include divestiture of financial subsidiaries 
in addition  a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a cra rating of satisfactory or better 
the financial modernization act also imposes extensive requirements on financial institutions with respect to the privacy of customer information  and modifies other existing laws  including those related to community reinvestment 
usa patriot act of on october   president bush signed the usa patriot act of the patriot act 
enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   the patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the impact of the patriot act on financial institutions of all kinds has been significant and wide ranging 
the patriot act substantially enhanced existing anti money laundering and financial transparency laws  and required appropriate regulatory authorities to adopt rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 
under the patriot act  financial institutions are subject to prohibitions regarding specified financial transactions and account relationships  as well as enhanced due diligence and know your customer standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
for example  the enhanced due diligence policies  procedures  and controls generally require financial institutions to take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions  to ascertain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of  and the source of funds deposited into  each account as needed to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions  to ascertain for any foreign bank  the shares of which are not publicly traded  the identity of the owners of the foreign bank  and the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner  and to ascertain whether any foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other foreign banks and  if so  the identity of those foreign banks and related due diligence information 
the patriot act also requires all financial institutions to establish anti money laundering programs  which must include  at minimum the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test the programs 
the company has incorporated the requirements of the patriot act into its operating procedures  and while these requirements have resulted in an additional time burden the financial impact on the company is difficult to quantify 

table of contents sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley was enacted to increase corporate responsibility  provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies  and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures pursuant to the securities laws 
sarbanes oxley includes important new requirements for public companies in the areas of financial disclosure  corporate governance  and the independence  composition and responsibilities of audit committees 
among other things  sarbanes oxley mandates chief executive and chief financial officer certifications of periodic financial reports  additional financial disclosures concerning off balance sheet items  and speedier transaction reporting requirements for executive officers  directors and shareholders 
in addition  penalties for non compliance with the exchange act were heightened 
sec rules promulgated pursuant to sarbanes oxley impose obligations and restrictions on auditors and audit committees intended to enhance their independence from management  and include extensive additional disclosure  corporate governance and other related rules 
sarbanes oxley represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems  such as the regulation of the accounting profession  and to state corporate law  such as the relationship between a board of directors and management and between a board of directors and its committees 
the company has not experienced any significant difficulties in complying with sarbanes oxley 
however  the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  significant time and expense in connection with its compliance with section of sarbanes oxley sox  which requires management to undertake an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the company s internal controls over financial reporting and requires the company s auditors to attest to  and report on  management s assessment and the operating effectiveness of these controls 
not including one full time staff position dedicated exclusively to sox and other internal staff time  the amount ultimately expended by the company specifically for compliance with sox for  the first year in which we were subject this regulation  totaled over  sox compliance expenses were somewhat lower for  although they are still estimated to be over other pending and proposed legislation other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the company  the bank and the banking industry in general are pending  and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the united states congress  the california legislature and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject the bank to increased regulation  disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the company or the bank would be affected thereby 
item a 
risk factors statements and financial discussion and analysis by management contained throughout this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements herein include  without limitation  the factors set forth below 
poor economic conditions in our market areas may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans and leases 
a substantial majority of our assets and deposits are generated in the san joaquin valley in central california 
as a result  poor economic conditions in this region could cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
the local economy currently appears to be experiencing a moderate expansion  and while the company expects continued improvement  no assurance can be given that this will occur 
the san joaquin valley has not experienced the same type of growth that has historically occurred in other areas of california  especially those where high tech industries have taken hold 
while this fact minimized the negative impact 
table of contents of the most recent recession  unemployment levels are still relatively high 
in the visalia tulare porterville metropolitan statistical area msa  for example  which is our geographic center and the base of our agriculturally oriented communities  the unemployment rate has consistently averaged around for the past several years 
while unemployment levels remain relatively high in all of the company s markets  in recent years some areas in the south and central san joaquin valley have experienced substantial commercial growth 
the area s relatively inexpensive real estate and central proximity to both southern and northern california have attracted a growing number of warehouse and distribution facilities  as well as manufacturing  health  and other service companies 
the low cost of housing has also drawn retirees from more expensive areas of california 
poor economic conditions affecting the agricultural industry could have an adverse effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us 
the company s balance of non performing assets has been relatively high in years past due in large part to persistent agricultural difficulties 
furthermore  a sizable portion of our total loan portfolio consists of loans to borrowers either directly or indirectly involved in the agricultural industry 
while a great number of our borrowers may not be individually involved in agriculture  many of the jobs in the san joaquin valley are ancillary to the regular production  processing  marketing and sales of agricultural commodities 
the ripple effect of lower commodity prices for milk  nuts  olives  grapes  oranges and tree fruit has a tendency to depress land prices  lower borrower income  and decrease collateral values 
weather patterns in particular are of critical importance to row crop  tree fruit  and orange production 
a degenerative cycle of weather and commodity prices can impact consumer purchasing power  which has the potential to create further unemployment throughout the san joaquin valley 
global competition is another significant issue affecting the agricultural industry 
because of increased global competition and other factors  excess supply and low prices currently characterize the markets for many agricultural products 
if current agricultural conditions do not improve  our level of non performing assets could increase 
such conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our borrower base and  by extension  our business 
concentrations of real estate loans could subject us to increased risks in the event of a real estate recession or natural disaster 
our loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in real estate loans  particularly commercial real estate 
at december   of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by real estate 
between the end of and the end of  our loans secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development loans increased from to of total loans  while loans secured by residential properties have decreased from to of total loans 
in the early s  the entire state of california experienced an economic recession that particularly impacted real estate values and resulted in increases in the level of delinquencies and losses for many financial institutions 
much of our market area seems to have been insulated from the significant fluctuations in real estate prices experienced by other parts of california over the past few decades 
however  over the past few years real estate values in our market areas have escalated at least as rapidly as in other parts of the state  and the collateral for many of our loans could be reduced in value and the ability of some of our borrowers to pay could decline if a real estate recession affects our market areas in the future 
similarly  the occurrence of a natural disaster like those california has experienced in the past  including earthquakes  brush fires  and flooding  could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans and negatively impact our results of operations 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
management intends to leverage the company s current infrastructure to grow assets  and the addition of new branches has been tentatively planned  although no assurance can be given that this strategy will result in significant growth 
our ability to manage growth will depend primarily on our ability to monitor and manage expanded operations  control funding costs and operating expenses  maintain positive customer relations  and attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
if we fail to achieve these objectives in an efficient and timely manner we may experience disruptions in our business plans  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents our earnings are subject to interest rate risk 
the earnings of most financial institutions depend largely on the relationship between the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings  and the yield on earning assets such as loans and investment securities 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic  regulatory and competitive factors that influence interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for our products and services  and the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than our interest earning assets 
given the current volume  mix  and re pricing characteristics of the company s interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  our interest rate spread is expected to increase slightly in a rising rate environment  and decrease slightly in a declining interest rate scenario 
however  there are scenarios where fluctuations in interest rates in either direction could have a negative effect on net income 
for example  if funding rates rise faster than asset yields in a rising rate environment ie  if basis compression occurs  or if we do not actively manage certain loan index rates in a declining rate environment  we would be negatively impacted 
we operate in a competitive market dominated by banks and other financial services providers  many of which have lower cost structures and offer more services 
in california generally  and in our primary service area specifically  branches of major banks dominate the commercial banking industry 
by virtue of their larger capital base  such institutions have substantially greater lending limits than we do  and perform certain functions for their customers  including trust services and international banking  which we are not equipped to offer directly but some of which we offer indirectly through correspondent relationships 
many of these banks also operate with economies of scale that result in lower operating costs relative to revenue generated 
we also compete with other financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  thrift and loan companies  mortgage companies  securities brokerage companies and insurance companies  and with quasi financial institutions such as money market funds for deposits and loans 
financial services like ours are increasingly offered over the internet on a national and international basis  and we compete with providers of these services as well 
ultimately  competition can drive down our interest margins and reduce our profitability 
it can also make it more difficult for us to continue to increase the size of our loan and deposit portfolios 
you may have difficulty selling your shares in the future if a more active trading market for our stock does not develop 
although sierra bancorp s common stock has been listed on the nasdaq national market since august  the effective date of the holding company reorganization and bank of the sierra s common stock was previously listed on the nasdaq national market since june   trading in our stock has not been extensive and cannot be characterized as amounting to an active trading market 
we may experience loan and lease losses in excess of our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we are careful in our loan underwriting process in order to limit the risk that borrowers might fail to repay  nevertheless  losses can and do occur 
we create an allowance for estimated loan and lease losses in our accounting records  based on estimates of the following industry standards  historical experience with our loans  evaluation of economic conditions  regular reviews of the quality mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb any specifically identified losses as well as any other losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that are beyond our control  may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates 
if actual losses exceed the amount reserved  it will have a negative impact on our profitability 
in addition  the fdic and the dfi  as part of their supervisory functions  periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or to recognize further losses  based on their judgments  which may be different from those of our management 
any increase in the allowance required by the fdic or the dfi could also hurt our business 

table of contents our directors and executive officers control a near majority of our stock  and your interests may not always be the same as those of the board and management 
as of december   our directors and executive officers  together with their affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of the bank s outstanding voting stock including vested option shares 
as a result  if all of these shareholders were to take a common position  they could most likely control the outcome of most corporate actions  such as approval of mergers or other business combinations  sales of all or substantially all of our assets  any matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities  incurrence of debt other than in the ordinary course of business  the selection and tenure of our chief executive officer  and payment of dividends on common stock or other equity securities 
in some situations  the interests of our directors and executive officers may be different from yours 
however  our board of directors and executive officers have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the shareholders  rather than in their own best interests  when considering a proposed business combination or any of these types of matters 
provisions in our articles of incorporation will delay or prevent changes in control of our corporation or our management 
these provisions make it more difficult for another company to acquire us  which could reduce the market price of our common stock and the price that you receive if you sell your shares in the future 
these provisions include the following staggered terms of office for members of the board of directors  the elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors  and the requirement that our board of directors consider the potential social and economic effects on our employees  depositors  customers and the communities we serve as well as certain other factors  when evaluating a possible tender offer  merger or other acquisition of the company

the company paid cash dividends totaling million  or per share in  and million  or per share in  representing and  respectively  of prior year earnings 
the company s general dividend 
table of contents policy is to pay cash dividends within the range of typical peer payout ratios  provided that such payments do not adversely affect the company s financial condition and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  no assurance can be given that earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend

the payment of any cash dividends by the bank will depend not only upon the bank s earnings during a specified period  but also on the bank meeting certain regulatory capital requirements 
the company s ability to pay dividends is also limited by state corporation law 
the california general corporation law prohibits the company from paying dividends on the common stock unless i its retained earnings  immediately prior to the dividend payment  equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or ii immediately after giving effect to the dividend the sum of the company s assets exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges would be at least equal to of its liabilities not including deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred liabilities and the current assets of the company would be at least equal to its current liabilities  or  if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years  at least equal to of its current liabilities

summary of performance the company achieved record earnings in  and in fact has increased net income in of the last years 
net income in was million  an increase of over million  or  over the million in net earnings achieved in net income in was million higher than net earnings of million 
net income per basic share was for  as compared to during and in the company s return on average assets was and return on average equity was in  as compared to and  respectively for  and and  respectively in 
table of contents the following are major factors impacting the company s results of operations in recent years solid growth in net interest income was a major contributor to the increases in net income in both and net interest income grew by million  or  in  and by million  or  in the growth in both periods was largely driven by an increased volume of earning assets 
while annual average loan balances grew by in and in  average investment balances grew by in and in due to the leverage strategy implemented in april the leverage strategy involved the initial purchase of million in mortgage backed securities that are guaranteed by agencies of the federal government  financed primarily with collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
this strategy added million to net interest income in on average outstanding balances of million  and million to net interest income during on average outstanding balances of million  boosting our return on equity in both years 
however  because of the addition of a significant level of lower margin earning assets  the company s net interest margin and return on average assets were not as high as they otherwise would have been 
another factor impacting net interest income in was a basis point increase in the company s net interest margin  which includes basis points attributable to an interest recovery 
the margin was also favorably impacted by rising short term interest rates  a increase in average demand deposit balances  and a significant reduction in non performing assets 
non interest income declined by in but did not change materially in non recurring items had the net effect of reducing non interest income by approximately  in and  in the principal variances in that will likely impact ongoing operations include the following a  drop in service charges on deposit accounts  although the negative trend in this income category appears to have been reversed with the implementation of risk based pricing for certain deposit accounts  a  increase in the loss on tax credit funds  and a  increase in debit and credit card interchange fees 
operating expense increased by in and in included in expenses were charges totaling  to write down other real estate owned to current market values  and  in audit and review costs related to our compliance with sox if expenses were decreased by  and expenses increased by  for the additional sox expenses  the year over year increase would have been for and for factoring out non recurring costs  most of the increase was in salaries and employee benefits  which were up by million due to regular annual increases and branch staff additions  and marketing costs  which increased by  due to a special marketing promotion that is not expected to be repeated 
the provision for loan losses was  lower in than in  but  higher in than in despite a million increase in net loans charged off in  the need to provide for loan losses was lower than in the previous year due to a million reduction in non performing loans and overall improved credit quality 
the provision was increased in despite lower loan charge offs and a significant drop in non performing assets  mainly due to loan growth and additional economic considerations  including a relatively rapid increase in real estate prices 
the provision for income taxes was back to a more typical level in  after a disproportionate jump in due to issues related to the company s now dissolved reit 
in the company added  to its regular tax provision  as necessitated by the removal of reit benefits from amended income tax returns filed in the first quarter of the following are important factors in understanding our current robust financial condition and liquidity position total assets grew by million  or  to billion at the end of from million at the end of if not for the bulk sale of million in residential mortgage loans  the early payoff of an million participation loan  and a million reduction in non performing assets  the growth rate for assets in would have been 

table of contents gross loan and lease balances increased by million  or  in  mainly from million growth in loans secured by commercial properties 
also increasing at a higher rate than the aggregate loan portfolio  and providing better balance to the portfolio in so doing  were direct finance leases  loans secured by farmland  and sba loans  which grew by   and respectively 
as noted above  having a negative impact on loan growth in were the first quarter mortgage loan sale  the participation loan payoff  and a reduction in non performing loans 
without those events  loan growth would have been 
non performing assets dropped by million  or  during a large part of the reduction was from the sale of a non accruing loan with a book balance of million 
approximately million of the reduction was due to a decline in oreo balances  of which  represented the write down of oreo during the year 
during  total investment balances declined only million  or  however this masks a fairly significant shift within the portfolio 
mortgage backed securities balances were million lower  due to relatively high prepayments and the sale of million in securities at the end of higher yielding municipal securities  on the other hand  were million higher  and agency securities were increased by million to provide additional collateral for pledging purposes 
in  non interest bearing deposits grew by million  or  climbing to of total deposits at the end of from at the end of relatively low cost now and savings deposits grew by million  or money market deposit account balances fell by million  or  as those balances shifted into higher rate time deposits during despite a drop of million in brokered time deposits  aggregate time deposits increased by million  indicating that we gained new money in that category in addition to transfers from money market accounts 
total non deposit borrowings  including junior subordinated debentures  fell to of total liabilities at the end of from at the end of this decrease is directly attributable to the runoff of million in term fhlb borrowings obtained pursuant to the leverage strategy 
results of operations the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income  which is interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the second is non interest income  which primarily consists of customer service charges and fees but also comes from non customer sources such as bank owned life insurance 
the majority of the company s non interest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
net interest income and net interest margin net interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in this represents an increase of in over  and an increase of in over the level of net interest income depends on several factors in combination  including growth in earning assets  yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volumes of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products which comprise the company s earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
the following distribution  rate and yield table shows  for each of the past three years  the annual average balance for each principal balance sheet category  and the amount of interest income or interest expense associated with that category 
this table also shows the yields earned on each component of the company s investment and loan portfolio  the average rates paid on each segment of the company s interest bearing liabilities  and the company s net interest margin

table of contents the volume and rate variances table below sets forth the dollar difference in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the noted periods  and the amount of such change attributable to changes in average balances volume or changes in average interest rates 
volume variances are equal to the increase or decrease in the average balance times the prior period rate  and rate variances are equal to the increase or decrease in the average rate times the prior period average balance 
variances attributable to both rate and volume changes are equal to the change in rate times the change in average balance

as shown above  pure volume variances contributed million to net interest income in relative to favorable changes in interest rates supplemented this amount by million  and the combined rate volume variance was a negative  for an overall increase of million in net interest income 
the positive volume variance is mainly due to growth in average earning assets  as evident in the distribution  rate yield table  but it can also be affected by fluctuations in the relative levels of average non earning assets including cash and due from banks  non interest liabilities including demand deposits  and equity 

table of contents average earning assets increased million  or  for relative to most of the increase was due to growth of million  or  in average loan balances 
average investment balances increased by million 
this represents a growth rate  which is double the growth rate for loans due to the impact of the leverage strategy 
average non earning assets were about of average total assets in both and  however the average balance of demand deposits  other liabilities  and shareholders equity increased to of average assets in from in average demand deposits grew by million  or  other liabilities grew by million  or  and shareholders equity increased by million  or  all of which exceeded the rate of growth in the aggregate balance sheet 
the increase in the relative level of non interest liabilities and equity contributed to the company s profitability in by reducing our need to obtain interest bearing funds 
note that the volume increase in earning assets added million to interest income  while the volume increase in interest bearing liabilities added only  to interest expense 
as with  the positive volume variance for was primarily the result of growth in average earning assets  however a reduction in the relative level of non earning assets also contributed to the company s profitability in the impact of the leverage strategy can be seen in the distribution  rate yield table in the increase in average taxable investments on the asset side  and average short term and long term borrowings on the liability side 
it contributed to the positive volume variance in both and  but had a negative impact on the rate variance 
the calculated rate increase for relative to was basis points for earning assets and basis points for interest bearing liabilities 
since the cost of interest bearing liabilities rose more than the yield on earning assets  it is counterintuitive that there would be a favorable rate variance in net interest income in the positive rate variance actually arises from the fact that the previous year s average balance is an integral part of the calculation 
interest earning assets exceeded interest bearing liabilities by million in  thus even though the rate increase for interest bearing liabilities was slightly higher than the rate increase for earning assets  it was applied to a substantially smaller base 
the favorable rate variance in was also due in part to the recovery of  in interest on a note that was sold during the year  and the accelerated recognition of  in fees on a participation loan that prepaid 
the company s net interest margin  which is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets  was in relative to in  an increase of basis points 
a substantial portion of the company s earning assets are variable rate loans that re price immediately when the company s prime lending rate is changed  versus a large base of core deposits that are generally slower to re price 
this causes the company s balance sheet to be slightly asset sensitive  which means that all else being equal  the company s net interest margin will be lower during periods when short term interest rates are falling and higher when rates are rising 
this effect was visible in  when the company s net interest margin rose in strong correlation to increases in short term market interest rates 
the net interest margin in was also favorably impacted by the aforementioned interest recovery  as well as a larger differential between average earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities 
as noted above in the discussion on rate and volume variances  in this differential was million  or of average assets  but in it rose to million  or of average assets 
the expansion was due to increases in average demand deposit balances  equity  and other liabilities  which were only slightly offset by a million increase in average non earning assets 
as in  rising rates boosted the company s net interest margin during the latter half of  however the effect of the leverage strategy more than offset this increase for relative to shorter term interest rates were going down during most of  however the establishment of informal floors on certain variable loan rates minimized the negative impact of falling rates on net interest income during that year 
management anticipates that the company s net interest margin could experience some compression if short term interest rates do not continue to rise  nevertheless we feel that net interest income will continue to increase if loans and core deposits grow as planned 
however  no assurance can be given that this will  in fact  occur 

table of contents provision for loan and lease losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans 
the company sets aside an allowance or reserve for loan and lease losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the income statement as the provision for loan and lease losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
the loan and lease loss provision is determined by conducting a monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses  and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current month s expense 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company s earnings 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are included below under allowance for loan and lease losses 
the company s provision for loan and lease losses was million in  million in  and million in the provision was  lower than in  despite increasing the reserve by million for a million unsecured commercial loan that was ultimately charged off during the year 
we were able to reduce the provision because of the recovery of previously charged off balances totaling million  which was credited back to the allowance for loan and lease losses  and because of a million reduction in non performing loans and an improvement in credit quality during in  the provision was  or  higher than in the previous year despite lower charge offs and a reduction in non performing loan balances  due primarily to reserves provided for growth in outstanding loan balances and a  specific reserve established for the aforementioned unsecured commercial loan 
because the provision exceeded net charge offs in the allowance for loan losses increased by  during the year  although it fell slightly as a percentage of total loans due to improvement in credit quality 
subsequent to a thorough review of the allowance relative to the current size  composition and quality of the company s loan and lease portfolio  it has been judged by management to be adequate to absorb currently identified potential losses as well as any likely future losses 
non interest revenue and operating expense despite a  increase in the gain on loan sales  the company s results reflect an overall decline of  or  in non interest income relative to the decline is mainly because of a drop in service charges on deposit accounts and several non recurring events 
in  non interest income fell slightly from the level realized in the prior year  because weak growth in service charges on deposits was not substantial enough to offset an adjustment to boli income that was needed to properly reflect potential early surrender charges 
non interest income declined to of average earning assets in from in operating expense increased million  or  in relative to  however it declined to of average earning assets in from in because of the healthy increase in net interest income  the increase in net interest plus other income in was proportionately greater than the increase in operating expense and the company s overhead efficiency ratio improved substantially 
the overhead efficiency ratio represents operating expense divided by the sum of fully tax equivalent net interest and non interest income  with the provision for loan losses  investment gains and losses  and other extraordinary income and expenses excluded from the equation 
the company s overhead efficiency ratio was in as compared to in the following table sets forth the major components of the company s non interest revenue and other operating expense  along with relevant ratios  for the years indicated

as shown  pass through losses generated by our limited partnership investments in low income housing tax credit funds are netted out of non interest income 
items of a non recurring nature that impacted non interest income in include a  gain on the bulk sale of million in residential mortgage loans  a  loss on the sale of investment securities resulting from a year end repositioning of the portfolio  gains on the sale of oreo totaling  that are reflected in the other category  and write downs of our investment in diversified holdings  inc totaling  that are also included in other 
in  the principal non recurring items include a  adjustment reducing boli income  as well as approximately  in gains from the sale of oreo 

table of contents despite fairly significant increases in average transaction account balances  the largest component of other operating income  service charges on deposit accounts  fell by  in and increased by only  in  and declined as a percentage of transaction accounts in both and the company s ratio of service charge income to average transaction accounts demand and interest bearing now accounts was in  in  and in this phenomenon is due in part to growth in accounts that are initially free of service charges 
most financial institutions in the company s market areas have similar free account offerings  and management views this as a defensive product 
the negative service charge impact is overcome by the fact that they provide interest free funding  expand the company s customer base  and increase cross sell opportunities for other bank products such as consumer loans and relatively low cost savings accounts 
part of the decline in service charges in is also due to the fact that returned item and overdraft fees fell by  relative to the prior year 
we assume that this decline is because the current relatively strong economy has provided most customers with enough liquidity to more effectively manage cash 
the aggregate decline in our service charge income appears to have been reversed in recent months with a revision in our deposit account fee structure  including tiered pricing for higher risk accounts 
however  despite this apparent reversal  we cannot provide assurance that service charges on deposits will not continue to fall 
other service charges  commissions  and fees constitute the second largest portion of non interest income  and totaled million in  million in  and million in in  the largest year over year increases within this category were in leasing income and service charge income from currency orders 
the largest decline was a  drop in income from our travel club which was dissolved at the end of in  the largest increases were a  increase in leasing income due to growth in that product line  and a  increase in atm fees and charges due to the implementation of fees for customer transactions at non bank atm s 
credit card fees include credit card interchange fees and credit card annual fees as their primary components 
credit card fees increased  or  in relative to  due primarily to a higher level of activity 
these fees increased to of total non interest income in from in checkcard fees represent checkcard interchange fees  which increased by  or  in  due to an increase in the number of cards and higher usage per card 
checkcard fees climbed to of non interest income in from in while it would appear on the surface that boli income increased in significance relative to overall non interest income in  this is mainly due to an adjustment in that reduced boli income by  the income adjustment stems from certain boli accounts that had been carried on the company s books gross of potential surrender charges  but which were written down in to reflect such surrender charges 
while it has not been our intent to sell or otherwise liquidate those policies  and the surrender charges diminish over time and ultimately disappear  accounting guidance received in late indicated that all boli should be reflected on our balance sheet net of any potential surrender charges 
the company invested an additional million in boli in august  however  the increase in earnings generated by this investment was partially offset by a lower average earnings rate on our aggregate boli investment 
income from loan sales was  in   in  and  in as noted previously  the increase in relative to is due to the first quarter sale of million in residential mortgage loans 
the company still originates a certain number of residential mortgage loans primarily those associated with its all in one construction through permanent financing product  and during we sold a number of those loans at a gain  but since the bulk loan sale in we have been holding almost all newly originated residential mortgage loans in our loan portfolio 
in past years we have been much more active in the residential mortgage lending business  but we currently refer the majority of our residential mortgage loan customers to moneyline lending  inc  which pays the company referral fees for successfully closed loans 
moneyline fees are reflected in other service charges  commissions and fees  and totaled  in and  in the sale of approximately million in underperforming investment securities in december resulted in a loss of  although this was partially offset by earlier gains on called securities and the net loss for the year was 
table of contents  there was a negligible gain on securities of  in the  gain on investment securities in is primarily comprised of liquidating dividends resulting from the company s investment in sphinx  as that company completed its planned dissolution 
sphinx was the shell company remaining after selling its primary earning asset  a core banking system known as phoenix which was previously utilized by the company 
commencing in  our loss on tax credit funds is shown as a separate category under non interest revenue because of its increasing significance 
the losses are an expected component of these investments  and are factored into the initial assessment of projected returns 
they represent our allocation of losses generated by the operations of low income housing tax credit funds in which we have limited partnership investments  and reduce the balance of our tax credit fund investments shown in other assets 
the loss increased by  in relative to  due in part to our additional million investment in a newly formed tax credit fund during the other category in non interest income dropped substantially in because of  in previously noted non recurring charges to write down the company s investment in diversified holdings corporation  a former title insurance holding company that is owned by several banks and individuals 
the primary operating subsidiaries of diversified were sold in  and the original million investment is now reflected on our books at  the approximate amount we ultimately expect to receive from the sale 
the other category also includes  in non recurring gains from the sale of other real estate owned in  and approximately  and  in such gains in and  respectively 
with our portfolio significantly reduced in size  further oreo gains are not anticipated in the near future 
also reflected in the other category is rental income from investment centers of america  which is in the form of percentage rents based on gross commissions generated  and which did not increase significantly in or turning to a detailed discussion of variances in other operating expenses  we start with the single largest component  salaries and employee benefits 
because they comprise such a significant portion of total operating expense  salaries and employee benefits typically experience a larger dollar increase than any other category 
true to form  the year over year growth in salaries and benefits in was million  or 
salaries increased by million  or  including approximately for regular annual pay increases and the addition of branch and administrative staff 
the full impact of the staff additions for our clovis office opened in june was felt in  as well as the cost of staff added in the summer of in anticipation of the opening of the new reedley branch later in the year 
staffing for administration and some of our more mature branches was also supplemented in and  to accommodate growth in loans and deposits and assure a continued high level of customer service 
due mainly to cost containment efforts related to workers compensation and group health insurance premiums  the increase in the cost of employee benefits was held to  or  in in  salaries and benefits increased by only  or  relative to this was in part the result of a million increase in salaries related directly to successful loan originations  which were deferred pursuant to fas and are subsequently being amortized as a reduction of yield over the life of the loans to which they relate 
employee benefits increased by a disproportionate  or  in  primarily because of a  or  increase in group health insurance premiums  and a  or  increase in workers compensation costs 
salaries and employee benefits were of average earning assets in both and  down from in the number of full time equivalent employees was at the end of  at the end of  and at the end of the annual increase in for total rent and occupancy costs  including furniture and equipment expenses  was only  or less than  although it was  or for these costs were of total operating expense in  down from in and in included in the increase are rent and depreciation costs  which were up by a combined  in  and maintenance and repair costs  which were down by  the non recurring charge off of  in obsolete telephone equipment in minimizes the increase in relative to  while exaggerating the increase in relative to in addition to this charge off  much of the increase in is the result of depreciation expense on equipment and software acquired in connection with the conversion of our core processing system at the beginning of advertising and marketing costs increased in by  or 
for the most part  this increase was caused by a special marketing promotion during the year involving targeted mailings and free gifts for new retail demand deposit accounts 
this particular campaign is not expected to be repeated and marketing expenses are not anticipated to increase in  although no assurance can be provided that this scenario will prove to be accurate 

table of contents total data processing costs increased in by  or  due to the commencement of maintenance fees on our core processing system 
data processing costs were almost the same in as in deposit services costs increased by  or in  due to higher armored car expenses  atm servicing costs  check card processing costs  and gift card costs 
in  deposit related costs increased by  or  due to higher atm network and servicing costs  higher check printing costs  and higher courier costs 
loan services expenses were up by a combined  in  an increase of 
if not for  in oreo write downs expensed in  this category would have declined due to a  reduction in oreo operating expenses 
we have already charged an additional  to expense in to further reduce the carrying value of an oreo  subsequent to the receipt of multiple offers on the property indicating its current market value 
although additional write downs are not expected  we cannot guarantee that the carrying value of the property will not require further adjustment  or that properties which may be added to oreo in the future will not be written down 
loan services expenses increased by  or  in  due mainly to higher oreo operating expenses and a  provision for unfunded commitments 
the other operating costs category includes telecommunications  postage  and other miscellaneous costs  and totaled million in  million in  and million in in  telecommunications expense increased by  or  while postage expense fell by  for the second year in a row  and other miscellaneous operating expenses increased  or 
in  miscellaneous operating expenses increased by  increases in miscellaneous operating expenses in both and were driven by increases in depreciation on operating leases and higher training costs 
legal and accounting costs were up by  in  due primarily to  in sox audit costs for that were expensed in legal costs for were up by  or  due mainly to an increase in legal costs related to collections 
the cost of other professional services increased by  or in  due principally to increased costs associated with the directors retirement and deferred fee plans 
income taxes the company s provision for federal and state income taxes was million in  while the tax provision was million and million for and  respectively 
this represents of income before taxes in  in  and in the effective tax rate was higher in than in either or  due in part to a  adjustment in associated with the filing of amended tax returns to exclude the benefit of the bank s real estate investment trust reit 
reit benefits were excluded subsequent to our receipt of an adverse interpretation of existing law that was released by the california franchise tax board ftb on december  without the adjustment in the rate would have been  the same as in but higher than in because non taxable income and tax credits did not increase at the same rate as pre tax income 
the company sets aside its provision for income taxes on a monthly basis 
as indicated in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of such provision is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income as adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
these permanent differences include but are not limited to tax exempt interest income  increases in the cash surrender value of boli  california enterprise zone deductions  certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions  and tax credits 
tax exempt interest income is generated primarily by the company s investments in state  county and municipal bonds  which provided million in federal tax exempt income in  million in  and million in although not reflected in the investment portfolio  the company also has total investments of million in low income housing tax credit funds as of december  these investments have generated substantial tax credits for the past few years  with about million in credits available for the tax year and million in tax credits realized in the investments are expected to generate an additional million in aggregate tax credits from through  however  the credits are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants and cannot be projected with complete certainty 

table of contents some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles  leading to timing differences between the company s actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary differences comprise the deferred portion of the company s tax expense  which is accumulated on the company s books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as it reverses 
at the end of  the company had a net deferred tax asset of million 
financial condition a comparison between the summary year end balance sheets for through was presented previously in the table of selected financial data see item above 
as indicated in that table  the company s total assets  loans  and shareholders equity have grown each year for the past four years 
the company experienced its most pronounced growth during  with total assets increasing by million  or  due to the aforementioned leverage strategy and strong organic loan growth 
total assets grew by only million  or  in because of the sale of million in mortgage loans and the prepayment of an million loan participation 
significant changes in the relative size of balance sheet components in include a million decline in non performing assets  a million  or  increase in demand deposit balances  and a million  or  decrease in non deposit borrowings 
within the deposit category  we also experienced a significant shift from money market deposits to higher cost time deposits 
the major components of the company s balance sheet are individually analyzed below  along with off balance sheet information 
loan and lease portfolio the company s loan and lease portfolio represents the single largest portion of invested assets  substantially greater than the investment portfolio or any other asset category  and the quality and diversification of the loan and lease portfolio are important considerations when reviewing the company s financial condition 
the company is not involved with chemicals or toxins that might have an adverse effect on the environment  thus its primary exposure to environmental legislation is through its lending activities 
the company s lending procedures include steps to identify and monitor this exposure in an effort to avoid any related loss or liability 
gross loans and leases represented of total assets at december   the same percentage as at december  since deposits grew at a faster rate than loans in  the ratio of net loans and leases to deposits declined to at the end of from at the end of demand for loans remains relatively strong in many areas within the company s markets and competition continues to intensify  especially in fresno and bakersfield 
to help ensure that we remain competitive  we have added leasing to our array of financing options  and make every effort to be flexible and creative in our approach to structuring loans 
the selected financial data table in item above reflects the amount of loans and leases outstanding at december st for each year from through  net of deferred fees and origination costs and the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the loan and lease distribution table that follows sets forth the company s gross loans and leases outstanding and the percentage distribution in each category at the dates indicated 
the amounts shown in the table do not reflect any deferred loan fees or deferred origination costs  nor is the allowance deducted

overall  loan demand in the company s immediate market has been weighted toward loans secured by real estate  especially loans secured by commercial and professional buildings 
the most significant shift in the loan portfolio mix over the past five years has been toward real estate loans secured by commercial properties  which increased to of total loans at the end of from at the end of commercial real estate is an important part of the company s lending focus and is likely to remain so for the immediate future 
commercial real estate loans increased by million  or  in  despite the early payoff of an million participation loan 
mainly because of growth in home equity lines  loans secured by residential properties grew by million  or  despite the sale of million in residential mortgage loans 
real estate loans secured by farmland grew by million  or  during  and have increased from to of total loans since the end of declining balances in our other component of agricultural loans  namely agricultural production loans  partially offset the increase in loans secured by farmland 
in  ag production loan balances fell by million  or  and they have declined from to of total loans since the end of the company has  to some extent  withdrawn from financing production lines  where year to year cash flow variations can impede the ability of borrowers to meet contractual repayment terms 
with uncertain commodity prices some of our borrowers have experienced declining equity in farming operations  and many are selling farm land for alternate uses such as housing and commercial development 
the company also originates and sells agricultural mortgage 
table of contents loans to certain investors  and the volume of agricultural mortgage loans serviced totaled million as of december  total loans serviced for others numbered with an aggregate balance of million as of the end of  as compared to loans with an aggregate balance of million at the end of commercial and industrial loans  including sba loans  increased by a combined million  or  in despite an overall trend upward for the past few years  their growth rate has lagged that of the aggregate portfolio and commercial loans declined to of total loans at the end of from at the end of the company s commercial loans are centered in locally oriented commercial activities in markets where the company has a physical presence  and this segment of the portfolio has struggled for growth as the local market has become increasingly competitive and other lenders have been willing to offer terms that do not fit our profit equation 
potential business has been passed over in some instances  and in others the company has taken real estate collateral as an abundance of caution  which causes the loans to be classified as commercial real estate 
the company also has a business unit dedicated to its sba product and is very active in specific sba program lending 
further  the company is designated as an sba preferred lender  which allows greater flexibility to meet small business loan requests with a more timely credit approval process 
in the past the company has sold some of its sba loans  and while we still have the ability to do so  our intention for the immediate future is to retain the sba loans we originate 
direct finance leases are also a form of secured commercial credit  and they have become an increasingly popular option for our business customers 
part of the reason for the limited growth in commercial loans is the growth in direct finance leases  which increased by million  or  in the consumer loans category represented of total loans and leases outstanding at december   and at december  these balances consist primarily of automobile loans and unsecured lines of credit 
consumer loans increased by million  or  during credit card loans represented just of total loans and leases outstanding at december   having declined from of total loans and leases at december  despite this decrease  the credit card segment of the company s loan product group remains an important part of the company s relationship oriented retail lending strategy 
loan and lease maturities the following maturity table shows the amounts of total loans and leases outstanding as of december   including non accruing loans 
the maturity distribution is grouped by remaining scheduled principal payments that are due within three months  after three months but less than one year  after one but within five years  or after five years 
the principal balance of loans due after one year is indicated by both fixed and floating rate categories

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in contractual arrangements 
these commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the company  yet are not reflected in any form within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
total unused commitments to extend credit were million at december   as compared to million at december  net of credit card lines available which were million and million at december  and  unused commitments represented and of outstanding gross loans and leases at december  and  respectively 
the company s stand by letters of credit at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the effect on the company s revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted  because there is no certainty that the lines of credit will ever be fully utilized 
for more information regarding the company s off balance sheet arrangements  see note to the financial statements located elsewhere herein 
contractual obligations at the end of  the company had contractual obligations for the following payments  by type and period due payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total non performing assets financial institutions generally have a certain level of exposure to asset quality risk  and could potentially receive less than a full return of principal and interest if a debtor becomes unable or unwilling to repay 
since loans are the most significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company s management of asset quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts  or as a result of the downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values 
in addition  certain debt securities that the company may purchase have the potential of declining in value if the obligor s financial capacity to repay deteriorates 
to help minimize credit quality concerns  we have established a sound approach to credit that includes well defined goals and objectives and well documented credit policies and procedures 
the policies and procedures identify market segments  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company s underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
the company s internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with loan and lease customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan and lease portfolio 
the company s credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values  and trends in particular industries or geographic markets 
as a multi community independent bank serving a specific geographic area  the company must contend with the unpredictable 
table of contents changes of the california and san joaquin valley markets 
the company s asset quality has suffered in the past from the impact of national and regional economic recessions  consumer bankruptcies  weather related agricultural losses  and depressed prices for agricultural goods 
in recent years  however  the san joaquin valley has experienced healthy commercial and residential growth 
major companies are discovering the san joaquin valley as an ideal location for distribution facilities  jobs are growing at a relatively fast rate  and comparatively low cost housing has attracted new residents from more expensive regions of california 
the company is optimistic that the local economy will continue to flourish  but no assurance can be given that this will in fact occur 
non performing assets are comprised of the following loans and leases for which the company is no longer accruing interest  loans and leases days or more past due and still accruing interest although they are generally placed on non accrual when they become days past due  loans and leases restructured where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a deferral of interest or principal  and other real estate owned oreo 
management s classification of a loan or lease as non accrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full recovery of principal or interest on the loan or lease 
at that point  the company stops accruing income from the interest  reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued as income  and begins recognizing interest income only as cash interest payments are received and as long as the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt 
the loans may or may not be collateralized  and collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans or leases may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and make full restitution 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management is offering or will offer for sale 
the following table provides information with respect to components of the company s non performing assets at the dates indicated 

table of contents non performing assets dollars in thousands as of december  nonaccrual loans and leases agricultural commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland total real estate small business administration loans consumer loans credit cards direct financing leases subtotal loans and leases days or more past due still accruing as to principal or interest agricultural commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland total real estate small business administration loans consumer loans credit cards direct financing leases subtotal total non performing loans and leases other real estate owned total nonperforming assets restructured loans and leases n a n a n a n a n a nonperforming loans and leases as of total gross loans and leases nonperforming assets as a of total gross loans and leases and other real estate owned additional interest income of approximately  would have been recorded for the year ended december  if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended or  if not outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended  since origination 
a restructured loan or lease is one where the terms were renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the balance of non performing assets at the end of represents a decrease of million  or  from year end levels 
non performing assets also declined by million  or  during the ratio of non performing assets to total gross loans plus oreo also fell substantially  to at the end of from at the end of  and non performing loans as a percentage of total loans and leases fell to from 
the main changes during were in loans secured by farmland  which were reduced by million due to the sale of a 
table of contents non accruing note  and oreo  which was reduced by million 
the sale of the note resulted in the recovery of  in previously charged off principal  as well as the payment of  in interest that had not been accrued 
the reduction in oreo was partly the result of  in write downs during the year  but was also due to the sale of several properties 
it should be noted that during the first quarter of  a million unsecured commercial loan was placed on non accrual 
since it was charged off subsequent to year end  however  it is not reflected in the table above 
in  the principal changes were in commercial and industrial loans  which dropped by million  agricultural loans  which fell by  and loans secured by farmland  which were  lower 
the decline in commercial and industrial loans was mainly due to a million relationship that was brought current when the customer collected delinquent payments owed to it under a government contract 
the company also collected a  balance plus past due interest under a usda guarantee  further reducing the balance of non accruing commercial loans 
the balance of agricultural loans and loans secured by farmland declined mainly due to principal pay downs  but also due in part to the charge off of balances deemed uncollectible 
while the current level of non performing assets represents significant improvement and is relatively low  we recognize that an increase in the dollar amount of non accrual loans and leases is possible in the normal course of business as we expand our lending activities 
we also expect occasional foreclosures as a last resort in the resolution of some problem credits 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is established through a provision for losses based on management s evaluation of known and inherent risks in the company s loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged against current earnings  and reduced by net charge offs 
loans and leases are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible  while recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received subsequent to the charge off 
we employ a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for loan and lease losses that includes a periodic review process and adjustment of the allowance at least quarterly 
our process includes a review of individual loans and leases that have been specifically identified as problems or have characteristics that could lead to impairment  as well as detailed reviews of other loans and leases either individually or in pools 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in non performing loans and leases  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans and leases  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and to other quantifiable external factors  such as commodity price changes and acts of nature freezes  earthquakes  fires  etc  that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors are at least to some extent based on management s judgment and experience 
they include an assessment of the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of agriculture and other key industries in the san joaquin valley 
the way a particular loan or lease might be structured  the extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies  the results of bank regulatory examinations  model imprecision  and the expected rate of portfolio growth are additional factors that are considered 
the table which follows summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the years indicated 
table of contents allowance for loan losses and leases dollars in thousands as of and for the years ended december  balances average gross loans and leases outstanding during period gross loans and leases outstanding at end of period allowance for loan and lease losses balance at beginning of period provision charged to expense charge offs agricultural commercial industrial loans real estate loans consumer loans direct financing leases credit card loans overdrafts total recoveries agricultural commercial industrial loans real estate loans consumer loans direct financing leases credit card loans overdrafts total net loan and lease charge offs balance at end of period ratios net loan and lease charge offs to average loans and leases allowance for loan and lease losses to gross loans and leases at end of period allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans and leases net loan and lease charge offs to allowance for loan and lease losses at end of period net loan and lease charge offs to provision for loan and lease losses includes small business administration loans 
the company s allowance for loan and lease losses increased by  during and ended the year at million 
the loss provision in totaled million  compared to million in net loans charged off were million in as compared to million in net charge offs in included a million unsecured commercial loan that was charged off in the fourth quarter 
net loans charged off in were of average loans and leases  compared to in a significant factor helping minimize net charge offs in was million in the recovery of previously charged off principal  compared to only  in recoveries in the 
table of contents prior year 
this high level of recoveries is due primarily to three loans  one of which was the note mentioned in the previous section that resulted in a  recovery when it was sold 
the other two were simply loans that had significant amounts charged off in previous years  where persistent collection efforts were ultimately successful 
in the table above  overdrafts account for net charge offs of  in and  in but none in previous years  because prior to losses stemming from overdraft balances were included as operating losses in operating expenses 
while uncollectible overdraft balances are now charged off as loan losses against the allowance for loan and lease losses  related overdraft fees and charges are still reflected as operating losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses dropped slightly to of total loans and leases at year end from at the end of the allowance increased to a very large percentage of non performing loans  due to the substantial decrease in non performing balances 
our methodology for determining the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is  and has been  consistently followed 
however  as we add new products  increase in complexity  and expand our geographic coverage  we expect to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan and lease portfolio 
on an ongoing basis we engage outside firms to independently assess our methodology and perform independent credit reviews of our loan and lease portfolio 
the company s external auditors and credit review consultants  the fdic  and the california department of financial institutions also review the allowance for loan and lease losses as an integral part of the examination processes 
management believes that the current methodology is appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
further  management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses was adequate as of december  to cover known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
fluctuations in credit quality  changes in economic conditions  or other factors could induce us to augment the allowance  however  and no assurance can be given that such factors will not result in increased losses in the loan and lease portfolio in the future 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for specific categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each category represents the total amounts available for charge offs that may occur within these categories

investment portfolio with a book value of million at december   the investment securities portfolio is the second largest component of the company s interest earning assets  and the structure and composition of this portfolio is important to any analysis of the financial condition of the company 
the investment portfolio serves the following purposes it can be readily reduced in size to provide liquidity for loan balance increases or deposit balance decreases  it provides a source of pledged assets for securing certain deposits and borrowed funds  as may be required by law or by specific agreement with a depositor or lender  it can be used as an interest rate risk management tool  since it provides a large base of assets  the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily 
table of contents than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak or when deposits grow more rapidly than loans  and it can enhance the company s tax position by providing partially tax exempt income 
the company uses two portfolio classifications for its investments held to maturity  and available for sale 
accounting rules also allow for a trading portfolio classification  but the company has no investments that would be classified as such 
the held to maturity portfolio can consist only of investments that the company has both the intent and ability to hold until maturity  to be sold only in the event of concerns with an issuer s credit worthiness  a change in tax law that eliminates their tax exempt status  or other infrequent situations as permitted by generally accepted accounting principles 
since the company does not have a trading portfolio  the available for sale portfolio is comprised of all securities not included as held to maturity 
even though management currently has the intent and the ability to hold the company s marketable investments to maturity  they are all currently classified as available for sale to allow flexibility with regard to the active management of the company s investment portfolio 
sfas requires available for sale securities to be marked to market on a periodic basis with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of equity 
monthly adjustments are made to that account to reflect changes in the market value of the company s available for sale securities 
the company s investment portfolio is currently composed primarily of us treasury and agency issues for liquidity and pledging  mortgage backed securities  which in many instances can also be used for pledging  and which generally enhance the yield of the portfolio  state  county and municipal obligations  which provide limited tax free income and pledging potential  and other equity investments 
the fourth category includes an equity investment in farmer mac stock  which is a required element to allow the company to sell certain agricultural loans to this quasi governmental agency 
securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements  public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law were million and million at december  and  respectively 
in  the investment portfolio declined by million  or  and dropped to of total assets at the end of from at the end of while the overall change is not significant  certain components of the investment portfolio changed dramatically 
mortgage backed securities were million lower at the end of than at the end of  a decline due to a relatively high level of prepayments as well as the year end sale of million in securities 
the sale  which did not involve any leverage strategy securities  was undertaken primarily to allow us to reinvest in higher performing bonds to extend duration  reduce negative convexity  and increase yield 
while we accomplished those objectives  the sale also resulted in a  loss 
the mortgage backed securities that were sold were replaced primarily by municipal bonds  which increased by over million  or  in in order to provide additional collateral for pledging purposes  our portfolio of us government agency securities was also increased during the year 
this category went up by million  or  during with this shift  mortgage backed securities fell to of the total portfolio at the end of from at the end of  while municipal securities increased to from and agency securities increased to from 
in  with the purchase of more than million for the leverage strategy  mortgage backed securities increased to of the total portfolio from at the end of us treasury and agency bonds declined to of the portfolio at the end of from at the end of  and municipal bonds fell to of the total portfolio at the end of from at the end of in reviewing actual balance changes  mortgage backed securities increased by million  while us government agency securities fell by million and municipal bonds were down by million in most of the decline in agencies was due to maturing bonds that were subsequently replaced with relatively higher yielding mortgage backed securities  while the drop in municipal securities was mainly from bonds that were called prior to maturity 
as can be seen on the distribution  rate yield table presented in a previous section  the average tax equivalent yield earned on total investments increased to in from in the following investment portfolio table reflects the amortized cost and fair market values for the total portfolio for each of the categories of investments for the past three years

cash and due from banks cash on hand and balances due from correspondent banks totaled million at the end of and million at the end of at december   cash and due from banks comprised of total assets  compared to at december  these balances fluctuate frequently and by large amounts depending on the status of cash items in process of collection and cash on hand  thus period end balances are not optimal indicators of trends in cash and due from banks 
annual average balances provide a much more appropriate gauge 
the average balance for both and was million 
this balance is expected to increase as we add branches in the future 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets and leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the related lease  or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
depreciation and amortization included in occupancy and equipment expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million during depreciation on equipment leased to others is reflected in other operating costs 
the following premises and equipment table reflects the balances by major category of fixed assets 
table of contents as of december  premises equipment dollars in thousands cost accumulated depr and amort net book value cost accumulated depr and amort net book value cost accumulated depr and amort net book value land buildings leasehold improvements construction in progress furniture and equipment total the net book value of the company s premises and equipment increased by  in  due mainly to the capitalized costs associated with building and outfitting the new reedley branch and remodeling another branch  although these costs were largely offset by the net increase in accumulated depreciation on furniture and equipment 
the net book value of the company s aggregate premises and equipment was of total assets at december   at december   and at december  other assets other assets increased by million  or  during  and were about of total assets at the end of both and the balance increase in is attributable to the following the net cash surrender value of boli increased by million  due to an additional million investment made in august plus earnings for the year  our investment in tax credit funds increased by million  due to an additional million commitment less pass through losses recognized during the year  we committed to a million investment in the central valley fund  a small business investment company formed to provide mezzanine capital primarily to small and mid sized businesses in the central valley  and our restricted stock balance declined million  due to a million reduction in fhlb stock in conjunction with our reduced fhlb borrowings and the  write down of our investment in diversified holdings corporation 
as noted above  the company holds certain equity investments that are not readily marketable securities and thus are classified as other assets on the company s balance sheet 
these include investments in pacific coast bankers bancshares  diversified holdings corporation dhc  california economic development lending initiative  and the fhlb 
the largest of these investments is the company s million investment in fhlb stock 
this investment fluctuates from time to time based on the company s borrowing activity at the federal home loan bank  and as noted earlier declined in due to a drop borrowings related to the leverage strategy 
and  as noted previously  the company s investment in dhc was written down during dhc is owned primarily by a consortium of california bank holding companies  none of which holds voting shares in excess of of the total voting stock of dhc 
dhc was the holding company for certain title insurance companies that were all sold during the current carrying value of  is equivalent to the amount of sale proceeds that we ultimately expect to collect 
the other assets category also includes low income housing tax credit funds  which lower the company s tax liability through direct tax credits as well as partnership operating losses 
pass through partnership losses from tax credit funds are charged against the company s investment in such funds  thus the investment has been written down from its original total of million to million at december  even taking losses into consideration and assuming no gain upon disposition  the estimated tax equivalent return on these investments over the expected year life is around  although no guarantee can be provided that this level of return will ultimately be realized 
as noted  the other assets category includes an aggregate million investment in bank owned life insurance at december  boli is an insurance policy with a single premium paid at policy commencement 
its initial net cash surrender value is equivalent to the premium paid  and it adds income through non taxable increases in its cash surrender value  net of the cost of insurance  plus any death benefits ultimately received by the company 
the costs of certain benefit plans added by the company in and are funded with boli income  but even net of the accruals for expected expenses associated with these benefit plans the boli is projected to have an annualized tax equivalent return of around 
no assurance can be given that this return will be fully realized every year  though 

table of contents at december   a million net deferred tax asset is also an element of the company s other assets 
most of the company s temporary differences between book and taxable income and expenses involve recognizing more expense in its financial statements than it has been allowed to deduct for taxes  therefore  the company s deferred tax assets typically exceeds its deferred tax liabilities 
the net deferred tax asset is primarily due to temporary book tax differences in the reported allowance for loan losses plus deferred compensation  net of deferred liabilities comprised mainly of fixed asset depreciation differences and deferred loan origination costs 
management has evaluated all deferred tax assets  and has no reason to believe that either the quality of the deferred tax assets or the company s future taxable income potential would preclude full realization of all amounts in future years 
deposits information concerning the average balance and average rates paid on deposits by deposit type for the past three fiscal years is contained in the distribution  rate  and yield table located in the previous section on results of operations net interest income and net interest margin 
the composition and cost of the company s deposit base are important components in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein 
our net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits can be concentrated in historically lower cost deposits such as non interest bearing demand  now accounts  savings accounts and money market deposit accounts 
the company s liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments  or in other words by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposit  meaning time deposits with balances that equal or exceed  as customers with balances of that magnitude are typically more rate sensitive than customers with smaller balances 
the company s community oriented deposit gathering activities  however  seem to have engendered a base of local customers who tend to display more brand loyalty and thus are less likely to leave the company than might otherwise be expected 
the company s total deposits grew by million  or during  and by million  or during during  core deposits  which include all deposits except brokered deposits and time deposits issued in denominations of  or more  increased by million  or 
that net increase includes a million drop in money market deposit accounts resulting from migration to higher rate jumbo time deposits  and excluding money market deposits  other core deposits increased by million  or 
the average balance per core deposit account was about  at the end of  approximately the same as at the end of core deposit accounts increased by  in number in  a increase 
the increase in customers and accounts was generated by marketing campaigns specifically targeting retail deposit products  and by more intense cross selling efforts in the company s branches 
we are focused on sustaining the momentum in core customer deposit growth in order to let brokered deposits roll off as they mature  although no assurance can be given that the company will achieve this objective 
as noted above  during money market accounts declined by million  or  while jumbo time deposits increased by million  or 
money market accounts fell to of total deposits at the end of from at the end of  while jumbo time deposits increased to of total deposits from 
despite this migration into a higher cost deposit category  a favorable volume shift is evident in non interest demand deposits  which increased to of total deposits at december  from at the end of december non interest demand deposit balances increased by million  or  in now and savings accounts increased by a combined million  or 

table of contents the scheduled maturity distribution of the company s time deposits as of december  was as follows as of december  deposit maturity distribution dollars in thousands three months or less three to six months six to twelve months one to three years over three years total time certificates of deposits  other time deposits  total in addition to deposit liabilities obtained in local markets  the company provides a cash management product to its commercial business customers 
this product group is categorized as a non deposit sweep account 
at december   the company s balance sheet includes million in repurchase agreements in short term borrowings see next section  secured by pledged investments held segregated from the company s securities portfolio  that represent such sweep accounts 
at december   the company s financial statements reflected approximately million in repurchase agreements 
due to their overnight nature  the cost of these sweep accounts has generally been lower than the company s interest rates for longer term funds 
it is anticipated that this product will remain an important aspect of the company s service capacity 
other borrowings the company utilizes other short term borrowings to temporarily fund loan growth when customer deposit growth has not kept pace with increases in outstanding loan balances 
in addition  short term borrowings may be used to purchase additional investments  or when additional liquidity is required to support higher customer cash utilization 
short term borrowings principally include overnight fed funds purchased  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb  and securities sold under repurchase agreements which were described more fully in the previous section 
the details of these borrowings for the years   and are presented below short term borrowings repurchase agreements dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year fed funds purchased dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year short term borrowings dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year 
table of contents in addition to short term borrowings  the company had million in long term borrowings on its balance sheet at december   down from million at december  the long term borrowings represent secured advances from the fhlb pursuant to the leverage strategy  and declined due to planned leverage strategy runoff 
original maturities on these borrowings range from one year up to five years 
capital resources at december   the company had total shareholders equity of million  comprised of million in common stock  million in retained earnings  and a million accumulated other comprehensive loss 
total shareholders equity at the end of was million 
net income has provided million in capital over the last three years  of which million or approximately was distributed in dividends 
while the retention of earnings has been the company s main source of capital since  the company has also issued a total of million in trust preferred securities through its unconsolidated wholly owned subsidiaries  sierra capital trust i and sierra statutory trust ii 
trust preferred proceeds are generally considered to be tier or tier capital for regulatory purposes  but long term debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  no assurance can be given that trust preferred securities will continue to be treated as tier capital in the future 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million  or per share in  and million  or per share in  representing of the prior year s earnings for and for the company anticipates paying future dividends of around to of the prior year s net earnings  which is within the range of typical peer payout ratios  however no assurance can be given that earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy 
management reviews various capital measurements on a regular basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that such measurements are within established internal and external guidelines 
the external guidelines  which are issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic  establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the federal reserve board and fdic guidelines tier and tier capital 
our tier capital currently includes common shareholders equity and the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities trust preferred securities are counted only up to a maximum of of tier capital  less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on securities available for sale  which are carried at fair market value 
our tier capital includes preferred stock  the amount of trust preferred securities not includible in tier capital  and the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
for a more detailed definition  see item  business supervision and regulation capital adequacy requirements herein 
at december   the company had a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
these are all higher than previous year end ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides more detailed information concerning the company s capital amounts and ratios 
at december   on a stand alone basis the bank had a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage capital ratio of 
as of the end of  both the company and the bank were considered to be well capitalized by regulatory standards 
we do not foresee any circumstances that would cause the either the company or the bank to be less than well capitalized  although no assurance can be given that this will not occur 
liquidity and market risk management liquidity liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain cash flows sufficient to fund operations  and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows  
table of contents or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages liquidity in such a fashion as to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities without maintaining excessive amounts of on balance sheet liquidity 
over abundant balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the interest margin 
an integral part of the company s ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the company s large base of core deposits  which are generated by offering traditional banking services in the communities in its service area and which have  historically  been a very stable source of funds 
in addition to core deposits  the company has the ability to raise deposits through various deposit brokers if required for liquidity purposes 
the company s net loan to deposit ratio decreased slightly to at the end of from at the end of  due to a deposit growth rate that exceeded the rate of loan growth during we also monitor the company s liquidity position and net non core funding dependence ratios  among others  with policy guidelines of above and below  respectively 
the liquidity position ratio is defined as net cash  non pledged investment securities  and other marketable assets  divided by total deposits and short term liabilities minus liabilities secured by investments or other marketable assets 
this ratio was at the end of december  and at the end of december the net non core funding dependence ratio is simply non core liabilities less short term investments  divided by long term assets 
it was at december  and at december  the unpledged portion of the company s investment portfolio is an integral component of liquidity management due to the relative ease with which many bonds can be sold 
there were million in unpledged marketable investments at the end of that could be sold for liquidity purposes if necessary 
management is of the opinion that its investments and other potentially liquid assets  along with other standby funding sources it has arranged  are more than sufficient to meet the company s current and anticipated short term liquidity needs 
along with available investment balances  sources of balance sheet liquidity include million in cash and due from banks  million in the guaranteed portion of sba loans  and million in the net cash surrender value of boli 
standby funding sources include a formal secured borrowing line with the federal home loan bank that has availability of million based on the current level of pledged real estate assets  informal unsecured short term liquidity lines for overnight fed funds with certain correspondent banks totaling million  and a million secured line at the federal reserve discount window 
interest rate risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has established policies and procedures to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments  nor does the company have exposure to currency exchange rates 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
to identify areas of potential exposure to rate changes  the company performs an earnings simulation analysis and a market value of portfolio equity calculation on a monthly basis 
this identifies more dynamic interest rate risk exposures than those apparent in standard re pricing gap analyses 
the company uses sendero modeling software for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company s net interest margin  and to calculate the estimated fair values of the company s financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the program imports current balances  interest rates  maturity dates and repricing information for individual financial instruments  and incorporates assumptions on the characteristics of embedded options along with pricing and duration for new volumes to project the effects of a given interest rate change on the company s interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company s investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and parallel change in all base rates  up or down  ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  economic based on current trends and econometric models or stable unchanged from current actual levels 

table of contents the company uses seven standard interest rate scenarios in conducting its simulations  namely stable  upward shocks of  and basis points  and downward shocks of   and basis points 
our policy is to limit the projected change in net interest income relative to the stable rate scenario for the next months to plus or minus based on a basis point bp shock  plus or minus based on a bp shock  and plus or minus based on a bp shock in interest rates 
while we do not expect current rates to fall significantly  our simulations assume that we would limit movement in the bank of the sierra prime rate in this scenario  as has been done in the past 
as of december   the company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile immediate change in rate bp bp bp bp bp bp change in net int 
inc in s change the above profile illustrates that if there were an immediate and sustained downward adjustment of basis points in interest rates  net interest income over the next twelve months would likely be million  or  lower than net interest income under a stable rate scenario 
by the same token  if there were an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the company s net interest income would likely be  or  higher than net interest income in a flat rate scenario 
according to these simulations the company is asset sensitive over a one year time frame  which is supported by fact the company has  in the past  seen erosion in its interest margin as rates are declining while benefiting in a rising rate environment 
the changes in net interest income under rising and declining rate scenarios are typically expected to bear more of a linear relationship 
the exposure to declining rates is disproportionate in these simulations  however  because some of the company s variable deposit rates are currently close to a floor of zero 
as rates on interest bearing liabilities hit this floor the company s yields on earning assets continue to fall  creating significant compression in the company s net interest margin 
this effect is exacerbated by the fact that prepayments on fixed rate loans tend to increase as rates decline 
the economic or fair value of financial instruments on the company s balance sheet will also vary under the interest rate scenarios previously discussed 
economic values for financial instruments are estimated by discounting projected cash flows principal and interest at current replacement rates for each account type  while the fair value of non financial accounts is assumed to equal book value and does not vary with interest rate fluctuations 
an economic value simulation is a static measure for balance sheet accounts at a given point in time  but this measurement can change substantially over time as the characteristics of the company s balance sheet evolve and as interest rate and yield curve assumptions are updated 
the amount of change in economic value under different interest rate scenarios is dependent upon the characteristics of each class of financial instrument  including the stated interest rate or spread relative to current market rates or spreads  the likelihood of prepayment  whether the rate is fixed or floating  and the maturity date of the instrument 
as a general rule  fixed rate financial liabilities gain in value as interest rates rise and lose value as interest rates decline  while fixed rate financial assets become more valuable in declining rate scenarios and less valuable in rising rate scenarios 
the longer the maturity of the financial instrument  the greater the impact a given rate change will have on its value 
in our economic value simulations  estimated prepayments are factored in for financial instruments with stated maturity dates  and decay rates for non maturity deposits are also projected based on management s best estimates 
we have found that model results are highly sensitive to changes in the assumed decay rate for non maturity deposits  in particular 
the economic value of equity eve is calculated by subtracting the estimated fair value of liabilities from the estimated fair value of assets 
the table below shows estimated changes in the company s eve under different 
table of contents interest rate scenarios relative to a base case of current interest rates  assuming changes in the bank of the sierra prime rate are restricted under declining rate scenarios immediate change in rate bp bp bp bp bp bp change in eve in s change the drop in eve as rates increase is the reverse of the positive slope apparent in the company s net interest income simulations  due primarily to the fact that million in non maturity deposits are assumed to run off at the rate of per year 
our net interest income simulations are dynamic rather than static  and thus incorporate growth rather than run off for non maturity deposits 
if a higher deposit decay rate is used for eve simulations the decline becomes more severe  while the slope conforms more closely to that of our net interest income simulations if non maturity deposits do not run off 
under declining rates  a floor of zero or slightly above zero for the discount rate on variable rate deposits and other liabilities  and increased principal prepayments and calls on investment securities and fixed rate loans  more than offset the increase in the value of fixed rate loans
