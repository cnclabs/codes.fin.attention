these include  but are not limited to  those described above under item a  risk factors 
overview at the end of we operated retail stores  including in new england and five in florida  and for the year we generated approximately million in sales and had a net loss of approximately million 
we opened six new stores in  five of which opened in the third quarter 
in we also achieved a increase in comparable stores sales for the comparable week period 
comparable store sales are defined as sales from those stores open for at least one full year 
this marks our fourth consecutive year of comparable store sales growth 
total sales for fiscal year included sales from a rd week 
total sales for fiscal year increased over fiscal year excluding sales from the rd week of  total sales for the comparable week period increased over the following table shows the sales percentage increase decrease for each quarter of compared to the same period for for comparable stores  non comparable stores which include sales from six new stores that opened in and sales from six new stores that opened in which were not included in comparable store sales in until they had been open for one full year and the rd week quarterly financial data mar jun sep dec fiscal year comparable store sales increase decrease non comp stores sales increase decrease rd week sales increase n a n a n a total sales increase decrease the year began with a decrease in comparable store sales in the first quarter of due to severe weather that impacted our new england stores  partially offset by an increase in sales related to the earlier than normal easter season as well as the post season success of the new england patriots in winning the super bowl 
in the second quarter  comparable stores sales decrease largely related to the easter shift 
comparable stores sales increased by in the third quarter mostly driven by higher sales of boston red sox related merchandise which we feel was due to increased exposure for our brand through our red sox sponsorship program as well as better inventory levels 
the year ended  with a increase in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter despite a decrease in comparable store sales for the halloween season 
we believe that the decrease for the halloween season was partially related to the shift to a monday halloween whereas halloween fell on a weekend in and partially related to  although to a lesser extent  more competition from temporary halloween stores than we had experienced in the past 
overall  our comparable stores sales increase of for did not meet our expectation considering we realized a increase in and a increase in in  sales from our new stores contributed significantly to our total sales increase 
throughout the year  our gross profit margin was negatively affected by increases in our product costs charged to us by certain key vendors primarily due to rising oil prices 
we adjusted our prices to reflect most of these increases  but given competitive pressure we were not able to pass on all of the increases to our customers 
we also experienced certain delays in implementing our price increases from the time that we were first notified of cost increases from our vendors due to the sheer number of these increases and certain technology limitations in our merchandising system 
by the fourth quarter  our gross profit margin had stabilized and was only slightly lower than the same period in overall  the effect of the increase in our product costs was higher than originally anticipated 
additionally  the costs associated with opening the six new stores in put pressure on our occupancy costs and marketing and sales expense 
our new stores operate at a higher cost to sales ratio until they reach maturity which typically occurs to months after opening 
as a result of the lower than expected comparable store sales  lower gross profit margin and the costs associated with opening six new stores in  we had an operating income in fiscal of and a loss of approximately million 
this loss is disappointing considering that it follows two years of profitability 
despite having a net loss for the year  we are pleased to report operating income for a third consecutive year 
in april  we increased the limit on our bank line of credit from  to  in september  we again increased the limit on our bank line of credit from  to  the increases to our bank line of credit were used to fund the costs associated with opening the six new stores 
our inventory and accounts receivable secure our line of credit 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  on january   we amended our agreement to allow for a  term loan which increases our borrowing base  but does not increase the million credit limit 
we borrowed the full  on that date 
the interest rate on the term loan is the bank s base rate plus basis points 
during the time in which the term loan remains outstanding  the interest rate on the line of credit is the bank s base rate plus basis points 
the term loan is currently outstanding and is due and payable in full on october  the amendment also waived a default as a consequence of the fact that the principal balance of the line of credit exceeded availability on january  as of march   we are in compliance with the covenants under our line of credit 
among our primary goals in are to increase our comparable store sales  increase our gross profit margin percentage and leverage our occupancy costs  marketing and sales expense and general and administrative expense as the stores we opened over the past two years reach maturity 
we do not currently plan to open any new stores in fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our consolidated revenues for fiscal  a week year  were  an increase of  or from the prior fiscal year  a week year 
revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
sales for fiscal included an increase of in comparable store sales  sales from six new stores that opened in and sales from six new stores that opened in which were not included in comparable stores sales in until they had been open for one full year 
comparable store sales for fiscal were negatively affected by the severe weather that impacted our new england region stores during the first quarter and lower than expected comparable store sales during the halloween season in the fourth quarter 
this shortfall was partially offset by positive comparable sales in the third quarter mostly driven by higher sales of boston red sox related merchandise which we feel was due to increased exposure for our brand through our red sox sponsorship program as well as better inventory levels 
cost of goods sold and occupancy costs our cost of products sold and occupancy costs for fiscal was  or of revenues  an increase of  and an increase of percentage points  as a percentage of revenues  from the prior fiscal year 
cost of products sold and occupancy costs consists of the cost of merchandise sold to customers and the occupancy costs for our stores 
as a percentage of revenues  the increase in cost of products sold was primarily attributable to increases in our product costs charged to us by certain key vendors primarily due to rising oil prices 
we adjusted our prices to reflect most of theses increases  but given competitive pressure we were not able to pass on all of the increases to our customers 
we also experienced certain delays in implementing our price increases from the time that we were first notified of cost increases from our vendors due to the sheer number of these increases and certain technology limitations in our merchandising system 
by the fourth quarter  our gross profit margin had stabilized and was only slightly lower than the same period in additionally  occupancy costs  as a percentage to revenue  was negatively affected by our new stores  which operate at a higher occupancy to sales ratio until they reach maturity 
marketing and sales expense our consolidated marketing and sales expense for fiscal was  or of revenues  an increase of  and an increase of percentage points  as a percentage of revenues  from the prior fiscal year 
marketing and sales expense consists primarily of advertising and promotional expenditures  all store payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities and other non payroll expenses associated with operating our stores 
as a percentage of revenues  the increase in marketing expense was primarily due to increased advertising  which included our sponsorship program with the boston red sox and the costs associated with supporting our new stores 
additionally  the increase in sales expense  as a percentage of revenues  was negatively affected by our new stores  which operate at a higher store payroll to sales ratio until they reach maturity as well as higher depreciation expenses related to the acquisition of fixed assets for new stores 
general and administrative expense our consolidated general and administrative g a expense for fiscal was  or of revenues  an increase of  and a decrease of percentage points  as a percentage of revenues  from the prior fiscal year 
g a expense consists of payroll and related expenses for executive  merchandising  finance and administrative personnel  as well as information technology  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
the increase in g a expense is largely attributable to professional fees related to our compliance work for section of sarbanes oxley act and consultant costs associated with the selection of a new merchandise system that we are currently planning to install in the first quarter of operating income our operating income for fiscal was  or of revenues  compared to an operating income of  or of revenues in fiscal other income in fiscal we reached a settlement with a third party in connection with the special charge pertaining to our preferred stock previously recorded in fiscal we recorded the net settlement of  as other income during fiscal interest expense our interest expense in fiscal was  an increase of  from fiscal the increase during fiscal was due to an increase in interest rates  a higher average loan balance and additional interest expense resulting from capital leases associated with our new point of sale system 
our average loan balance was approximately  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal  which increased interest expense by approximately  the effective interest rate on our borrowings under our line of credit increased to during fiscal compared to in fiscal  which increased interest expense by approximately  the interest rate was based on the bank s base rate plus basis points 
additionally  interest expense from capital leases in increased by  over income taxes in  due to our net loss for the year  we did not provide for federal or state income taxes 
additionally  we did not utilize any net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in in our provision for income taxes was  which included  for federal alternative minimum taxes and  for state income taxes 
we were able to utilize approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in  which were fully reserved for in the prior year due to the uncertainty of future taxable income 
at the end of we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in in accordance with section of the internal revenue code  the use of these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations based upon certain ownership changes of our stock that may have occurred or that may occur 
net loss our net loss in fiscal was  or per basic and diluted share  compared to net income of  or per basic and per diluted share  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues our consolidated revenues for were  an increase of  or from the prior year 
revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
this increase was due to an increase of in comparable stores sales  sales from six new stores that opened in and sales from three new stores that opened in which were not included in comparable stores sales in until they had been open for one full year 
the increase in comparable stores sales was largely attributable to a stronger halloween season compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold in our consolidated cost of products sold was of revenues  a decrease of percentage points from the prior year 
cost of products sold consisted of the cost of merchandise sold to customers and the occupancy costs for our stores 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the elimination of costs of products sold for our internet business  which was licensed to a third party in in exchange for royalties under a license agreement 
marketing and sales expense our consolidated marketing and sales expense for was  or of revenues  an increase of  or percentage points  as a percentage of revenues  from the prior year 
marketing and sales expense consisted primarily of all store payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities  as well as advertising  public relations and promotional expenditures 
this increase  as a percentage of revenues  was due to store payroll and other expenses related to marketing and sales in our new stores  which run at a higher than normal rate until they reach maturity 
our experience has been that it usually takes about to months after opening for a store to reach maturity 
general and administrative expense our consolidated g a expense for was  or of revenue  an increase of  or percentage points  as a percentage of revenues  from the prior year 
g a expense consisted of payroll and related expenses for executive  merchandising  finance and administrative personnel  as well as information technology  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
the increase in g a costs was attributable to rate increases in payroll related costs  such as unemployment insurance  health insurance and workers compensation insurance  and start up costs associated with implementing our new point of sale system 
operating income our operating income for fiscal was  or of revenues  compared to an operating income of  or of revenues in fiscal other income in we reached a settlement with a third party in connection with the special charge previously recorded in fiscal year we recorded the net settlement of  as other income during fiscal interest expense our interest expense was  in  an increase of  from the prior year 
this increase was due to higher average borrowings that were largely offset by lower interest rates 
income taxes in our provision for income taxes was  which included  for federal alternative minimum taxes and  for state income taxes 
we were able to utilize approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in  which were fully reserved for in the prior year due to the uncertainty of future taxable income 
at the end of we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in in accordance with section of the internal revenue code  the use of these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations based upon certain ownership changes of our stock that may have occurred or that may occur 
net income our net income for was  or per basic and per diluted share  compared to net income of  or per basic and diluted share for critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
inventory and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory our inventory consists of party supplies and is valued at the lower of moving weighted average cost or market 
we record vendor rebates  discounts and certain other adjustments to inventory  including freight costs  and we recognize these amounts in the income statement as the related goods are sold 
during each interim reporting period we estimate the impact on cost of products sold associated with inventory shortage 
the actual inventory shortage is determined upon reconciliation of the annual physical inventory  which occurs shortly before and after our year end  and an adjustment to cost of products sold is recorded at the end of the fourth quarter to recognize the difference between the estimated and actual inventory shortage for the full year 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
we also make adjustments to reduce the value of our inventory for an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  which is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future sales 
we conduct reviews periodically throughout the year on each stock keeping unit sku 
as we identify obsolete and excess inventory  we take immediate measures to reduce our inventory risk on these items and we adjust our allowance accordingly 
thus  actual results could differ from our estimates 
in  we refined our methodology for accounting for vendor rebates  discounts and freight and for estimating an appropriate allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
the net impact of these adjustments increased pre tax income by  and net income by  in but had no impact on basic and diluted earnings per share 
revenue recognition revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
we estimate returns based upon historical return rates and such amounts have not been significant 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
at the beginning of fiscal we adopted a new policy for estimating the useful life of fixed assets which extended the useful life of equipment and furniture and fixtures 
changing the estimated life of the assets in these categories as of the beginning of reduced depreciation expense by approximately  in fiscal net income in would have been per basic and diluted share as opposed to per basic and per diluted share if this change in estimating the useful life of fixed assets had not been adopted 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a review of each store for impairment indicators whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable from estimated future store cash flows 
our review considers store operating results  future sales growth and cash flows 
the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from current estimates if underlying assumptions or business strategies change 
we are not aware of any impairment indicators for any of our stores at december  income taxes historically  we have not recognized an income tax benefit for our losses 
accordingly we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of future taxable income and the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in determining if a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset is appropriate  we consider both positive and negative evidence 
the positive evidence that we considered included we were profitable in and due to the success of our halloween seasons  we have achieved positive comparable store sales growth for the last three years and improved merchandise margins in and the negative evidence that we considered included after two years of profitability we realized a net loss in  our merchandise margins decreased in  our future profitability is vulnerable to certain risks  including a the risk that we may not be able to generate significant taxable income to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  b the risk of unseasonable weather and other factors in a single geographic region  new england  where our stores are concentrated  c the risk of being so dependent upon a single season  halloween  for a significant amount of annual sales and profitability and d the risk of rising prices for petroleum products  which are a key raw material for much of our merchandise and which affect our freight costs  the costs that opening new stores will put pressure on our profit margins until these stores reach maturity  the investment in infrastructure required in fiscal to support our store expansion plan in fiscal will increase our costs and the expected costs of increased regulatory compliance  including  without limitation  those associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act  will likely have a negative impact on our profitability 
the negative evidence is strong enough for us to conclude that the level of our future profitability is uncertain at this time 
we believe that it is prudent for us to maintain a valuation allowance until we have a longer track record of profitability and we can reduce our exposure to the risks described above 
should we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would increase income in the period we made such a determination 
previous restatement of financial information and balance sheet presentation of series a f convertible preferred stock the holders of our various series of convertible preferred stock have the right to a liquidation preference  which previously could have been exercised under certain events not within our control 
in accordance with eitf topic d  we have included the respective equity securities outside of permanent stockholders deficit in our accompanying table of selected financial data as of december  and december  at their respective carrying values 
during the fourth quarter of  the composition of our board of directors changed such that holders of our convertible preferred stock or the designates of our preferred stockholders no longer constituted a majority of our board members 
this change in the composition of our board of directors has permitted us to present our convertible preferred stock in equity in the accompanying balance sheets as of december  and december   at their respective carrying values as the redemption is deemed to be solely within our control 
we will continue to review and consider the criteria in eitf topic d at the reporting of each balance sheet 
stock option compensation expense we account for our stock option compensation agreements with employees under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we were required to adopt statement r on january  early adoption was permitted for periods in which financial statements had not yet been issued 
in response to fas no 
r  on september   our board of directors approved an acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options previously awarded to our employees and officers with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share 
as a result  options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately 
based upon our closing stock price of on september   none of these options had any intrinsic value on the date of acceleration 
in making the decision to accelerate these options  our board of directors considered the interest of our stockholders as this acceleration will reduce our reported compensation expense in future periods following the effectiveness of fas no 
r 
the future stock option expense that was eliminated was approximately  on a pre tax basis and is reflected in the pro forma footnote disclosure for the year ended december  statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted statement r on january  and will use the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  as of december  we accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  we believe that the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the precise impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter clarifying his staff s interpretation of certain accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles gaap relating to operating leases 
in summary  the staff s interpretation is that leasehold improvements should be amortized by the lessee over the shorter of their economic lives or the lease term  which could include lease renewal terms when the renewals are reasonably assured  free or reduced rents should be recognized by the lessee on a straight line basis over the lease term including any free or reduced rent period and the statement of cash flows should reflect cash received from the lessor that is accounted for as a lease incentive within operating activities and the acquisition of leasehold improvements for cash within investing activities 
these positions are based upon existing accounting literature 
we believe that our present accounting policies are consistent with the positions described by the chief accountant and his staff in this letter 
our policy is to amortize leasehold improvements for years or the life of the lease  whichever period is shorter 
our policy is to amortize free or reduced rent on a straight line basis over the lease term including any free or reduced rent periods 
we generally do not enter into agreements that involve receiving cash from lessors landlords 
liquidity and capital resources our operating activities used  in fiscal compared to providing  in fiscal  a variance of  the additional cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the net loss in fiscal compared net income in fiscal the variance due to the net loss in was partially offset by the increases in depreciation expense  decreases in cash used for inventory and increases in cash provided by accounts payable 
the increase in cash provided by accounts payable was primarily due to the extended payment terms related to the inventory purchased for the five new stores opened in the third quarter of these payables became due in the first quarter of we used  in investing activities in fiscal compared to  in the cash invested in was primarily for fixed assets associated with new stores  an existing store expansion and point of sale system enhancements 
the cash invested in fiscal was predominantly for fixed assets associated with new stores and the new point of sale system 
we provided  by financing activities in compared to  in  a decrease of  this decrease was largely due to an increase in our payments on capital lease obligations by  over additionally  we increased our borrowings under our line of credit by  in to million compared to an increase of  in to million 
the borrowings under our line of credit in was higher than primarily due to capital expenditures related to new store openings  enhancements to our point of sale system  and to support our net loss 
during we also acquired assets under capital leases totaling  for new copiers for our support office 
the capital lease obligations outstanding at december  were  at december  we had a line of credit the line with wells fargo retail finance ii  llc  which had been amended on january  the amendment extended the maturity date of the line to january   eliminated the minimum interest rate of  established a new interest rate at the bank s base rate plus basis points and added the option to increase the line in increments of  beyond the previous limit of  to a limit of  upon days written notice  as long as we were in compliance with all debt covenants and the other provisions of the loan agreement 
our inventory and accounts receivable secure our line of credit 
we borrow against these assets at agreed upon advance rates  which may vary at different times of the year 
on september   we increased our line of credit to  to help finance our operations and store openings 
our inventory consists of party supplies which are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market and are reduced by an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory and other adjustments  including vendor rebates  discounts and freight costs 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against acceptable inventory at cost  which takes our inventory at cost and reflects adjustments that our lender has approved which may be different than adjustments we use for valuing our inventory in our financial statements  such as the adjustment to reserve for inventory shortage 
the amount of acceptable inventory at cost was approximately  at december  our accounts receivable consists primarily of vendor rebates receivables and credit card receivables 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against eligible credit card receivables  which are the credit card receivables for the previous three days of business 
the amount of eligible credit card receivables was approximately  at december the total borrowing base is then determined by adding the acceptable inventory at cost times an agreed upon advance rate plus the eligible credit card receivables times an agreed upon advance rate but not to exceed our established credit limit 
the total borrowing base at december  was limited to our credit limit of  under the terms of our line of credit  the credit limit amount of  was then further reduced by a minimum availability block  customer deposits  gift certificates  merchandise credits and outstanding letters of credit 
therefore  our additional availability at december  was approximately  the amounts outstanding under our line were  as of december  and  as of december  the outstanding balances under our line are classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since we are required to apply daily lock box receipts to reduce the amount outstanding 
on april   we amended our agreement to allow for a special subline that would increase our borrowing base by  upon activation of the special subline  the interest rate on the line of credit would have been the bank s base rate plus basis points through the special subline termination date 
we did not activate the special subline and the special subline terminated on november  subsequent to the end of fiscal  on january   we amended our agreement to allow for a  term loan which increases our borrowing base  but does not increase the million credit limit 
we borrowed the full  on that date 
the interest rate on the term loan is the bank s base rate plus basis points 
during the time the term loan remains outstanding  the interest rate on the line of credit will be the bank s base rate plus basis points
