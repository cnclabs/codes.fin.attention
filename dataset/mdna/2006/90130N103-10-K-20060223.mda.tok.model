the following table summarizes unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  gross and net of applicable reinsurance  with respect to our lines of business amounts in thousands years ended december  gross net gross net unpaid losses and lae personal auto lines homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff total gross unpaid losses and lae increased by million in primarily due to a reserve increase of million in the personal auto lines as a result of growth in our customer base 
the increase in the personal auto lines was offset by the million net decrease in the homeowner and earthquake lines  which are in runoff see critical accounting estimates losses and loss adjustment expenses for a description of the company s reserving process 
unearned premiums decreased to million at the end of compared to million at the end of primarily due to a decrease in premiums written in the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in debt of million consists of million of capital lease obligations and million senior notes  net of discount see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the primary purpose of the capital leases and senior note borrowings was to increase the statutory surplus of st century insurance company  our wholly owned insurance subsidiary  which had significant adverse earthquake and auto reserve development in   and the decrease in debt of million is primarily attributable to principal payments on the capital leases 
effective december   we changed our state of incorporation from california to delaware 
in connection with the change  our common stock was assigned a par value of per share  resulting in a reclassification of million from common stock to additional paid in capital 
there was no change in the location of company operations  location of employees  or the way we do business as a result of the reincorporation 
liquidity and capital resources st century insurance group 
our holding company s main sources of liquidity historically have been dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries and proceeds from issuance of debt or equity securities 
apart from the exercise of stock options and restricted stock grants to employees  the effects of which have not been significant  we have not issued any equity securities since when aig exercised its warrants to purchase common stock for cash of million 
our insurance subsidiaries have not paid any dividends to our holding company since due to the previous uncertainty surrounding the taxability of dividends received by holding companies from their insurance subsidiaries in california 
see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  we completed a private offering of million principal amount of percent senior notes due in december the effective interest rate on the senior notes  when all offering costs are taken into account and amortized over the term of the senior notes  is approximately percent per annum 
of the million net proceeds from the offering  million was used to increase the statutory surplus of our wholly owned insurance subsidiary  st century insurance company  and the balance was retained by our holding company 
on july   the company completed an exchange offer in which all of the private offering notes were exchanged for publicly registered notes having the same terms 
effective december   the california department of insurance  approved an intercompany lease whereby st century insurance company leases certain computer software from our holding company 
the monthly lease payment  currently million  started in january and is subject to upward adjustment based on the cost incurred by the holding company to enhance the software 
on november   the cdi permitted an amendment to a term loan line that increased the available amount from million to million that our insurance subsidiary  st century insurance company  can loan to our holding company 
see further information in note b of the notes to condensed financial information of registrant 
our holding company s significant cash obligations over the next several years  exclusive of any dividends to stockholders that our directors may declare  consist of interest payments on the senior notes approximately million annually  ongoing costs to enhance our computer software  and the repayment of the million principal on the senior notes due in we expect to be able to meet those obligations from sources of cash currently available ie  cash and investments at the holding company  which totaled million at december   payments received from the intercompany lease  and borrowing from our insurance subsidiary  additional funds obtainable from the capital markets or dividends received from our insurance subsidiaries 
the effective california state income tax rate applicable to any such dividends paid from our subsidiaries  if taxable  is approximately 
our insurance subsidiaries could pay million in as dividends to the holding company without prior written approval from insurance regulatory authorities 
insurance subsidiaries 
we have achieved underwriting profits in our core auto insurance operations for the last sixteen quarters and have thereby enhanced our liquidity 
our cash flow from operations and short term cash position generally are more than sufficient to meet obligations for claim payments  which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business  tend to have an average duration of less than a year 
in california  where approximately of our premium is written  underwriting profit improved in without additional rate increases 
effective october   we implemented a class plan revision for our california business 
this is a rate neutral change overall  but is intended to improve the accuracy of our pricing 
as of december   our insurance subsidiaries had a combined statutory surplus of million compared to million at december  the increase in statutory surplus was primarily due to statutory net income of million offset by a decrease in net deferred tax assets of million  an increase in nonadmitted assets of million  and an increase in net unrealized equity investment losses of million 
the ratio of net premiums written to statutory surplus was at december   compared to at december  transactions with related parties several subsidiaries of aig together own approximately of our outstanding common stock and three of the ten members of our board of directors are employees of aig 
since  the company has entered into transactions with aig subsidiaries  including reinsurance agreements  insurance coverage contracts  and various services 
reinsurance agreements the company s catastrophe reinsurance agreement for its personal auto lines is provided by three participating entities  two of which are aig subsidiaries 
together they reinsure any covered event up to million in excess of million effective january  up to million in excess of million in 
this coverage was renewed effective january  and see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total premiums ceded to aig subsidiaries were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
total reinsurance recoverables  net of payables  from aig subsidiaries were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
corporate insurance coverage the company has obtained the following corporate insurance policies from aig subsidiaries workers compensation insurance general liability insurance property insurance umbrella excess insurance fiduciary liability insurance fidelity insurance auto insurance employment practices liability insurance errors and omissions insurance was carried with aig through september  insurance expense attributable to aig corporate insurance coverages was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
investment management and investment accounting in october  as a result of a competitive bidding process  we entered into an agreement with an aig subsidiary to provide investment management and investment accounting services to the company 
the fees are determined as a percentage of the average invested asset balance and are classified with net investment income 
this agreement was approved by the cdi 
investment management and accounting expense was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
software and data processing through december   the company utilized certain third party software and data processing monitoring tools under an agreement negotiated by aig 
since january   the company has negotiated its own contracts  and no longer incurs any software or data processing costs with aig subsidiaries 
charges by aig for software and data processing were million in and there was no expense in contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain contractual obligations  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding senior notes 
payments due by period amounts in millions total through through remaining years after senior notes capital lease obligations debt operating leases other long term commitments future pension benefit payments expected loss and lae payments  net of reinsurance total the table above excludes periodic contributions to pension plans  which are discussed below 
the capital lease obligations above resulted from the sale leaseback transaction discussed earlier and an auto capital lease transaction see further discussion of these items in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have no material purchase obligations or other on or off balance sheet long term liabilities or obligations at december  see discussion about variable interest entities in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our largest insurance subsidiary is responsible for making payments on both the capital lease obligations and most of the operating lease obligations 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
total contributions to the plans were million  million and million in   and  respectively 
for the past several years we have followed the practice of contributing sufficient amounts to the qualified defined benefit pension plan to meet or exceed statutory funding requirements  without exceeding the maximum amount that would be deductible for corporate income tax purposes  and while maintaining plan assets at a level at least equal to the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits 
the amount and timing of future contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan depends on a number of unpredictable factors including statutory funding requirements  the market performance of the plan s assets  cash requirements for benefit payments to retirees  and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plan s obligations 
contributions to our non qualified defined benefit pension plan generally are limited to amounts needed to make benefit payments to retirees  which are expected to total approximately million in off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no letters of credit  no trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value  and no obligations under any derivative financial instruments 
in addition  the company has no material retained interests in assets transferred to any unconsolidated entity see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  st century insurance group has issued guarantees on behalf of its insurance subsidiaries related to the capital lease obligations described above 
the board of our company has made a commitment to invest a portion of policyholder surplus in economically disadvantaged communities 
in connection with this commitment  the company has guaranteed  or million  of a warehouse financing agreement 
the company has also committed million for other community investment purposes 
these commitments  which do not significantly impact the company s liquidity or capital  are further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
includes amounts due under long term software license agreements of approximately million

the results for include a million increase in income in the third quarter associated with the resolution of california legislation ab related to holding company taxes on dividends from insurance subsidiaries 
the results for include after tax charges of million in the first quarter to strengthen earthquake reserves and an increase in after tax net income of million in the second quarter  resulting from nonrecurring  nonoperational items and a favorable tax settlement with the irs 
personal automobile insurance is our primary line of business

direct premiums written increased in  in and in  for a three year compound average growth rate of  less than our long term goal of 
market conditions in california were somewhat less favorable for growth in than in the preceding two years 
in and  we met our profitability goals  posting our best combined ratios since and our direct premiums written grew despite an increasingly competitive california marketing climate 
as we proceed with our multi state expansion  we believe that achieving our long term growth goal will steadily depend less on the california marketplace 
net premiums earned increased in  compared to a increase in and in these earned premium increases are consistent with the direct premium written increases during the same years of  and  respectively 
the company has undertaken several geographic expansion efforts to increase its opportunities for growth 
net losses and lae incurred increased in  in and in the loss and lae ratios were   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effects on the net loss and lae ratios of changes in estimates relating to insured events of prior years were as follows favorable in  favorable in  unfavorable in  and unfavorable in for additional discussion of these estimates  please see item of this report under the heading unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
in general  changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which new information becomes available indicating that a change is warranted  usually in conjunction with our quarterly actuarial review

the increase was primarily due to our investments in the geographic expansion strategy  costs associated with the conversion to our new technology platform  and facility and support costs 
the increase in consists primarily of increased advertising costs  additional sales workforce costs  and facility and support costs to improve service and support the texas service center 
the increase in was primarily due to growth in advertising expenditures and costs associated with increasing the number of new sales agents to handle record volume of new business during several productivity enhancement initiatives are underway aimed at reducing per unit processing costs 
the combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to and for and  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to favorable prior accident year loss and lae development of million and million in and  respectively  and unfavorable prior accident year loss and lae development of million in homeowner and earthquake lines in runoff results

we have executed various transactions to exit from our homeowner line 
under a january  agreement with balboa insurance company balboa  a subsidiary of countrywide financial corporation countrywide  of homeowner unearned premium reserves and losses on or after that date were ceded to balboa 
under the terms of this agreement  we retain certain loss adjustment expenses 
we began non renewing homeowner policies expiring on february   and thereafter 
substantially all of these customers were offered homeowner coverage through an affiliate of countrywide

no such impairments were recorded in   or see discussion under critical accounting estimates investments 
other income 
other income of million in relates to interest income for refund claims with the taxing authorities 
no other income was reported in other income of million in the year ended december   included million resulting from a nonrecurring  nonoperational item from the settlement of litigation  interest income of million relating to a favorable settlement with the internal revenue service irs  and miscellaneous items of million 
pension cost 
the company has both funded and unfunded non contributory defined benefit pension plans  which together cover essentially all employees who have completed at least one year of service 
for certain key employees designated by the board of directors  the company sponsors an unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan 
expense recognition under the pension accounting rules is based upon the attribution of plan benefits over the expected life of the company s workforce 
pension plan costs remained relatively constant at million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the weighted average discount rate assumption used to determine the net cost decreased to from for the years ended and  respectively 
based on current assumptions  the company does not expect to be required to contribute to its qualified pension plan in  but it may make additional contributions into its pension plans in fiscal and subsequent years depending on how the funded status of those plans change and also depending on the outcome of proposed changes to the funding regulations currently being considered by the united states congress 
our nonqualified pension plan has an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation of million 
in this situation  the accounting rules require that we record an additional minimum pension liability 
the additional minimum pension liability adjustment was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in the additional minimum pension liability in fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate from at december   to at december  the accounting rules do not require that changes in the additional minimum pension liability adjustment be recorded in current period earnings  but rather they are recorded directly to equity through accumulated other comprehensive income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other expenses 
in november  the company vacated approximately of rentable space at its headquarters in woodland hills  california and plans to sublease this space 
a loss on this vacated space has been recognized totaling million  as future rental costs are higher than potential market rentals 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on estimates and assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some of our accounting policies require significant judgment to estimate values of either assets or liabilities 
in addition  significant judgment may be needed to apply what often are complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have discussed the assumptions most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to estimate the related items involved 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key assumptions could change future valuations and materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates  together with any changes therein  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the estimated liabilities for losses and lae include estimates of losses for known claims reported on or prior to the balance sheet dates  estimates of losses for claims incurred but not reported  estimates of expenses for investigating  adjusting and settling all incurred claims 
amounts reported are estimates of the ultimate costs of settlement  net of estimated salvage and subrogation 
the estimated liabilities are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events  such as changes in medical and repair costs  as well as economic and social conditions that impact the settlement of claims 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
the methods used to determine such estimates and to establish the resulting reserves are continually reviewed and updated 
any resulting adjustments are reflected in current operating income on a dollar for dollar basis 
for example  an upward revision of million in the estimated recorded liability for unpaid losses and lae would decrease underwriting profit  and pre tax income  by the same million amount 
conversely  a downward revision of million would increase pre tax income by the same million amount 
it is management s belief that the reserves for losses and lae are adequate to cover unpaid losses and lae as of december  while we perform quarterly reviews of the adequacy of established unpaid losses and lae reserves  there can be no assurance that our ultimate unpaid losses and lae will not develop redundancies or deficiencies and possibly differ materially from our unpaid losses and lae as of december  in the future  if the unpaid losses and lae develop redundancies or deficiencies  such redundancy or deficiency would have a positive or adverse impact  respectively  on future results of operations 
the process of making changes to unpaid losses and lae begins with the preparation of several point estimates  a review of the actual claims experience  actual rate changes achieved  actual changes in coverage  mix of business  and changes in certain other factors such as weather and recent tort activity that may affect the loss and lae ratio 
our actuaries prepare several point estimates of unpaid losses and lae for each of the coverages  and they use their experience and judgment to arrive at an overall actuarial point estimate of the unpaid losses and lae for that coverage 
meetings are held with appropriate departments to discuss significant issues as a result of the review 
this process culminates in a reserve meeting to review the unpaid losses and lae 
the basis for carried unpaid losses and lae is the overall actuarial point estimate 
other relevant internal and external factors considered include a qualitative assessment of inflation and other economic conditions  changes in the legal  regulatory  judicial and social environments  underlying policy pricing  exposure and policy forms  claims handling  and geographic distribution shifts 
as a result of the meeting  unpaid losses and lae are finalized and we record quarterly changes in unpaid losses and lae for each of our coverages 
the change in unpaid losses and lae for the quarter for each coverage is the difference between net ultimate losses and lae and the net paid losses and lae recorded through the end of the quarter 
the overall change in our unpaid losses and lae is based on the sum of these coverage level changes 
the point estimate methods include the use of paid loss triangles  incurred loss triangles  claim count triangles  and severity triangles  as well as expected loss ratio methods 
quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective consideration  including managerial judgment  to assure management satisfaction that the overall unpaid losses and lae are adequate to meet projected losses 
for example  in property damage coverages  repair cost trends by geographic region vary significantly 
these factors are periodically reviewed and subsequently adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect emerging trends which are based upon past loss experience 
thus  many factors are implicitly considered in estimating the loss costs recognized 
judgment is required in analyzing the appropriateness of the various methods and factors to avoid overreacting to data anomalies that may distort such prior trends 
for example  changes in limits distributions or development in the most recent accident quarters would require more actuarial judgment 
we do not believe disclosure of specific point estimates calculated by the actuaries would be meaningful 
any one actuarial point estimate is based on a particular series of judgments and assumptions of the actuary 
another actuary may make different assumptions  and therefore reach a different point estimate 
there is a potential for significant variation in ultimate development of unpaid losses and lae 
most automobile claims are reported within two to three months whereas the estimate of ultimate severities exhibits greater variability at the same maturity 
generally  actual historical loss development factors are used to project future loss development  and there can be no assurance that future loss development patterns will be the same as in the past 
however  we believe that our reserving methodologies are in line with other personal lines insurers and would normally expect ultimate unpaid losses and lae development to vary approximately from the carried unpaid losses and lae 
the company has experienced changes in the mix of business and policy limits 
we believe that the assumption with the highest likelihood of change that could materially affect carried unpaid losses and lae is the estimate of the frequency of unpaid bodily injury claims 
the company has experienced approximately lower bodily injury claim frequency over the past years in california 
a change in the estimate of the frequency of unpaid bodily injury claims would result in an approximate increase or decrease in total unpaid losses and lae of  or million 
property and equipment 
accounting standards require a write off to be recognized when an asset is vacated or an asset group s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
accounting standards require asset groups to be tested for possible impairment under certain conditions 
there have been no events or circumstances in that would require a reassessment of the asset group for impairment 
income taxes 
determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any related valuation allowance involves judgment 
gaap require deferred tax assets and liabilities dtas and dtls  respectively to be recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributed to temporary differences and carryforwards based on provisions of the enacted tax law 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
temporary differences are differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements 
for example  we have a dta because the tax bases of our loss and lae reserves are smaller than their book bases 
similarly  we have a dtl because the book basis of our capitalized software exceeds its tax basis 
carryforwards include such items as alternative minimum tax credits  which may be carried forward indefinitely  and net operating losses nols  which can be carried forward years for losses incurred before and years thereafter 
a summary of the significant dtas and dtls relating to the company s temporary differences and carryforwards is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   our dtas total million and our dtls total million 
the net of those amounts  million  represents the net deferred tax asset reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   our dtas total million and our dtls total million 
the net of those amounts  million  represents the net deferred tax asset reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to reduce dtas but not dtls by a valuation allowance to the extent that  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than that any dtas will not be realized 
recognition of a valuation allowance would decrease reported earnings on a dollar for dollar basis in the year in which any such recognition were to occur 
the determination of whether a valuation allowance is appropriate requires the exercise of management judgment 
in making this judgment  management is required to weigh the positive and negative evidence as to the likelihood that the dtas will be realized 
the company s net deferred tax assets include a net operating loss nol carryforward for regular federal corporate tax purposes of approximately million  representing an unrealized tax benefit of million at december   compared to million  million and million as of the end of the three preceding years 
the steady decline in the unrealized tax benefit of the nol since resulted from the generation of taxable underwriting and investment income in the intervening years 
at the current rate of utilization  the company s remaining nol excluding st of southwest should be fully utilized by the end of  but in any event long before its statutory expiration 
portions of our nol carryforward are scheduled to expire beginning in  as shown in the table below amounts in thousands year of expiration nol excluding st of southwest srly nol of st of southwest consolidated nol totals our ability to fully utilize the remaining nol depends on future taxable income either from continued operating profitability or from tax planning strategies we could implement  such as increasing the taxable portion of our investment portfolio 
because of the company s history of profitability over the past three years  management believes it is reasonable to expect future underwriting profits and to conclude it is at least more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefits of all of our dtas  including our nol 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recognized as of december  and however  generating future taxable income is dependent on a number of factors  including regulatory and competitive influences that may be beyond our ability to control 
future underwriting losses could possibly jeopardize our ability to utilize our nols 
in the event adverse development or underwriting losses due to either sb matters or other causes were to occur  management might be required to reach a different conclusion about the realization of the dtas and  if so  recognize a valuation allowance at that time 
srly stands for separate return limitation year 
under the federal tax code  only future income generated by st of southwest may be utilized against this portion of our nol 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs dpac include premium taxes  advertising  and other variable costs incurred with writing business 
these costs are deferred and amortized over the month policy period in which the related premiums are earned 
management assesses the recoverability of dpac on a quarterly basis 
the assessment calculates the relationship of actuarially estimated costs incurred to premiums from contracts issued or renewed for the period 
we do not consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs 
based on current indications  management believes that these costs are fully recoverable as of december  the loss and lae ratio used in the recoverability estimate is based primarily on expected ultimate ratios provided by our actuaries 
while management believes that is a reasonable assumption  actual results could differ materially from such estimates 
investments 
investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions at inception with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas for available for sale securities they are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
the cost of investment securities sold is determined by the specific identification method 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
in general  a security is considered a candidate for impairment if it meets any of the following criteria trading at a significant percent or more discount to par  amortized cost if lower or cost for an extended period of time nine months or longer  the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in i the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation  or ii the issuer seeking protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws or any similar laws intended for the court supervised reorganization of insolvent enterprises  or iii the issuer proposing a voluntary reorganization pursuant to which creditors are asked to exchange their claims for cash or securities having a fair value substantially lower than par value of their claims  or in the opinion of the company s management  it is possible that the company may not realize a full recovery on its investment  irrespective of the occurrence of one of the foregoing events 
for investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events  where the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary 
where declines in values of securities below cost or amortized cost are considered to be other than temporary  such as when it is determined that an issuer is unable to repay the entire principal  a charge is required to be reflected in income for the difference between cost or amortized cost and the fair value 
the determination of whether a decline in market value is other than temporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment 
no such charges were recorded in  or the timing and amount of realized losses and gains reported in income could vary if conclusions other than those made by management were to determine whether an other than temporary impairment exists 
however  there would be no impact on equity because any unrealized losses are already included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
in addition to market risk we are exposed to other risks  including the credit risk related to the issuers of the financial instruments in which we invest  the underlying insurance risk related to our core business and the exposure of the personal lines insurance business  as a regulated industry  to legal  legislative  judicial  political and regulatory action 
financial instruments are not used for trading purposes 
the following disclosure reflects estimated changes in value that may result from selected hypothetical changes in market rates and prices 
actual results may differ 
fixed maturity financial instruments 
our cash flow from operations and short term cash position generally have been more than sufficient to meet our projected obligations for claim payments  which by the nature of the personal automobile insurance business  tend to have an average duration of less than one year 
the company also obtained long term fixed rate financing as a means of increasing the statutory surplus of the company s largest insurance subsidiary in and as a result  it has been unnecessary for us to employ elaborate market risk management techniques involving complicated asset and liability duration matching or hedging strategies 
accordingly  the company primarily invests in fixed maturity investments  which at december   comprised of the fair value of the company s total investments 
the remainder of the company s investments  representing approximately of total investments at fair value  is held in equity securities 
for all of our fixed maturity investments  we seek to provide for liquidity and diversification while maximizing income without sacrificing investment quality 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk where the value of the fixed maturity portfolio decreases as market interest rates increase  and conversely  when market interest rates decrease  the value of the fixed maturity portfolio increases 
duration is a common measure of the sensitivity of a fixed maturity security s value to changes in interest rates 
the higher the duration  the more sensitive a fixed maturity security is to market interest rate fluctuations 
effective duration also measures this sensitivity  but it takes into account call terms  as well as changes in remaining term  coupon rate  cash flow  and other items 
since fixed maturity investments with longer remaining terms to maturity tend to realize higher yields  the company s investment philosophy typically resulted in a portfolio with an effective duration of over years 
due to the changing interest rate environment  management  in consultation with the investment committee  targeted a lower duration for the company s fixed maturity investment portfolio to reduce the negative impact of potential increases in interest rates 
as a result  the effective duration of the total fixed maturity portfolio declined from approximately years as of december  to years at december  the graphical depiction of the relationship between the yield on bonds of the same credit quality but with different maturities is usually referred to as a yield curve 
because the yield on us treasury securities is the base rate or risk free rate from which non government bond yields are normally benchmarked  the most commonly constructed yield curve is derived from the observation of prices and yields in the treasury market 
an upward sloping curve  where yield rises steadily as maturity increases  is referred to as a normal yield curve 
the following table shows the carrying values of our fixed maturity investments  which are reported at fair value  and our debt  which is reported at amortized cost 
the table also presents estimated fair values at adjusted market rates assuming a parallel basis point increase in market interest rates  given the effective duration noted above  for the fixed maturity investment portfolio and a parallel basis point decrease in market interest rates for the debt determined from a present value calculation 
the following sensitivity analysis summarizes only the exposure to market interest rate risk amounts in millions december  carrying value estimated carrying value at adjusted market rates prices indicated above change in value as a percentage of carrying value fixed maturity investments available for sale  at fair value debt  amortized cost the discussion above provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of our fixed rate financial instruments 
the actual impact of interest rate changes on our fixed maturity investments in particular may differ significantly from those shown  as the analysis assumes a parallel shift in market interest rates 
the analysis also does not consider any actions we could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in interest rates 
market participants usually refer to the difference between long term treasury yields and short term treasury yields as the slope of the yield curve 
if the spread between the long end of the curve  where maturities are high  and the short end of the curve  where maturities are low  narrows  the yield curve is said to be flattening 
conversely  if the spread between the long end of the curve and the short end of the curve widens  the yield curve is said to be steepening 
if the yields on the long end of the curve fall below those of the short end of the curve  the yield curve is said to be inverted 
the analysis above assumes a parallel shift in interest rates 
however  the curve may also steepen  flatten or become inverted 
this type of behavior may affect certain sections of the curve in disproportionate amounts 
for example  if short term treasury yields rise and the yield curve flattens  fixed maturity instruments with short duration may be impacted to a greater degree than fixed maturity instruments with longer duration 
conversely  if long term treasury yields rise and the yield curve steepens  fixed maturity instruments with long duration may be impacted to a greater degree than fixed maturity instruments with shorter duration 
the following summarizes the duration distribution of our fixed maturity investments portfolio 
duration ranges december  below to to to to to market value percentage of fixed maturity investment portfolio equity securities 
the common equity portfolio  which represents approximately of total investments at fair value  consists primarily of industrial and miscellaneous stocks 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s equity securities was at december  and at december  the following table presents the consolidated financial statement fair value of our equity securities portfolio and the effect of a hypothetical reduction in the overall value of the stock market using the beta noted above and accordingly summarizes only the exposure to equity price risk for the company s equity securities portfolio amounts in millions december  fair value estimated fair value at hypothetical reduction in overall value of stock market change in value as a percentage of fair value equity securities available for sale  at fair value the discussion above provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of our equity securities 
the actual impact of price changes on the equity securities may differ significantly from those shown 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited because it does not consider any actions we could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in equity prices
