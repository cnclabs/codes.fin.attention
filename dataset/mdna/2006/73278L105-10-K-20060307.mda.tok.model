item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  of this form k 

table of contents customers and products we serve roughly  customers  none of which account for more than of our sales 
we primarily serve five types of customers swimming pool remodelers and builders  retail swimming pool stores  swimming pool repair and service businesses  landscape construction and maintenance contractors  and golf courses 
the majority of these customers are small  family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources 
we conduct our operations through service centers in north america and europe 
our primary markets  which have the highest concentration of swimming pools  are california  florida  texas and arizona  representing approximately of our net sales in we use a combination of international and local sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers businesses 
our international personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities  creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise 
our local sales personnel work from the service centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers specific needs 
we offer our customers more than  national brand and private label products 
we believe that our selection of pool equipment and supplies  chemicals  replacement parts and complementary products is the most comprehensive in the industry 
the products we sell can be categorized as follows maintenance products such as chemicals  supplies and pool accessories  repair and replacement parts for cleaners  filters  heaters  pumps and lights  packaged pool kits including walls  liners  bracing  filters  heaters  pumps and coping for in ground and above ground pools  pool equipment and materials for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools  and complementary products  including construction materials used for pool installations and remodeling  such as concrete  plumbing and electrical components and pool surface and decking materials  irrigation and landscape products  including professional lawn care equipment  and other discretionary recreational and related outdoor lifestyle products that enhance consumers use and enjoyment of outdoor living spaces 
maintenance products and repair and replacement parts are non discretionary in nature  meaning that these items must be purchased by end users to maintain existing swimming pools and landscaped areas 
over of our gross profits are derived from the sale of products used to maintain and repair these existing features and less than are derived from the construction and installation equipment  materials  plumbing  electrical  etc 
of new pools and landscaping 
our complementary product sales grew in  excluding horizon  and have grown from approximately million in to over million in this growth has been an important factor in our base business sales growth over the past six years 
including horizon s fourth quarter sales  complementary products sales grew over and accounted for nearly of our total net sales at comparable margins to our traditional product offerings 
we have identified other product categories that could become part of our complementary product offerings in the future 
we typically choose two to three categories each year and introduce them in certain markets 
we then evaluate the performance of these test categories and focus on those which we believe exhibit long term growth potential 
in  we intend to continue to expand our complementary products initiative by 
table of contents increasing the number of locations which offer complementary products  increasing the number of complementary products offered at certain locations and also through a modest broadening of the product offerings on a company wide basis 
we expect complementary product sales to approach of our total sales in operating strategy we operate three distribution networks the scp distributors scp network  the superior pool products superior network and the horizon distributors horizon network 
the scp network consists of service centers  including locations in europe  the superior network consists of locations and the horizon network consists of locations 
we distribute swimming pool supplies  equipment and related leisure products through our scp and superior networks and we distribute irrigation and landscape products through our horizon network 
we adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the swimming pool marketplace primarily for two reasons to offer our customers a choice of different distributors  featuring distinctive product selections and service personnel  and to increase the level of customer service and operational efficiency provided by the service centers in each network by promoting healthy competition between the two networks 
we evaluate our service centers based upon their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures 
our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services including customer and vendor related programs  information systems support and expert resources to help achieve their goals 
we employ incentive programs and feedback mechanisms along with the competitive nature of our internal networks to stimulate performance 
distribution our service centers are located near customer concentrations  typically in industrial  commercial or mixed use zones 
customers may pick up products at any service center location  or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 
our service centers maintain well stocked inventories to meet customers immediate needs 
we utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving  inventory control  picking  packing and shipping functions 
in addition  we operate five centralized shipping locations and two construction materials centers that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our service centers or directly to customers 
purchasing and suppliers we enjoy good relationships with our suppliers  who generally offer competitive pricing  return policies and promotional allowances 
it is customary in our industry for manufacturers to seasonally offer extended payment terms to qualifying purchasers such as pool 
these terms are typically available to us for pre season or early season purchases 
we initiated a preferred vendor program in which encourages our buyers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors 
we work closely with these vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and concentrate our purchasing activities 
these practices  together with a more comprehensive service offering  have resulted in improved margins at the service center level 

table of contents we regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost  service and quality standards 
our largest suppliers include pentair corporation  hayward pool products  inc and waterpik technologies  inc  which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the cost of products we sold in competition based on industry knowledge and available data  management believes we are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products  and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the united states 
additionally  we are one of the top three regional distributors of landscape and irrigation products in the united states 
we face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and to a lesser extent  mass market retailers and large pool supply retailers with their own internal distribution networks 
we also compete against one national wholesale distributor of landscape and irrigation products 
some geographic markets we serve  particularly our largest  higher density markets in california  florida  texas and arizona  are more competitive than others 
barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low 
we compete with other distributors for rights to distribute brand name products 
if we lose or are unable to obtain these rights  we might be materially and adversely affected 
we believe that the size of our operations allows us to compete favorably for such distribution rights 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and landscape supply distribution are the breadth and availability of products offered  the quality and level of customer service  the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs  consistency and stability of business relationships with customers  and competitive product pricing 
we believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors

environmental  health and safety regulations our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and federal  state and local environmental and health and safety requirements including the emergency planning and community right to know act and other environmental protection agency regulations  the hazardous materials transportation act and other department of transportation regulations  and the occupational safety and health act osha 
most of these requirements govern the packaging  labeling  handling  transportation  storage and sale of pool chemicals and landscape chemicals and fertilizers 
we store certain types of chemicals and or fertilizers at each of our service centers  and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes 
in addition  we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws 
these laws are primarily related to labeling  annual registration and licensing 

table of contents employees we employed approximately  people at december  given the seasonal nature of our business  our peak employment period is the summer  when we add up to more employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand 
intellectual property we maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks primarily for our private label products  and we intend to maintain the trademark registrations that are important to our current and future business operations

risk factors cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our disclosure and analysis in this report contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our forward looking statements express our current expectations or forecasts of possible future results or events  including projections of future performance  statements of management s plans and objectives  future contracts  and forecasts of trends and other matters 
you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts and often use words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  believe  will likely result  outlook  project and other words and expressions of similar meaning 
no assurance can be given that the results in any forward looking statements will be achieved and actual results could be affected by one or more factors  which could cause them to differ materially 
for these statements  we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act 
risk factors certain factors that may affect our business and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements include the following we are susceptible to adverse weather conditions 
weather is the principal external factor affecting our business 
for example  unseasonably late warming trends can decrease the length of the pool season and unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary rainfall during the peak season can decrease swimming pool use  installation and maintenance  as well as landscape installations and maintenance 
these weather conditions adversely affect sales of our products 
for a discussion regarding seasonality and weather  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations  of this form k 
our distribution business is highly dependent on our ability to maintain favorable relationships with suppliers and manufacturers 
as a distribution company  maintaining favorable relationships with our suppliers is critical to the success of our business 
we believe that we add considerable value to the swimming pool supply chain and landscape supply chain by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and distributing the products to a highly fragmented customer base on conditions that are more favorable than these customers could obtain on their own 
we believe that we currently enjoy good relationships with our suppliers  who generally offer us competitive pricing  return policies and promotional allowances 
however  our inability to maintain favorable relationships with our suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business 
our largest suppliers are pentair corporation  hayward pool products  inc and waterpik technologies  inc  which accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the costs of products we sold in while we do not believe that the loss of any single supplier would adversely affect our business  a decision by several suppliers  acting in concert  to sell their products directly to retail customers and other end users of their products  bypassing distribution companies like ours  would have an adverse effect on our business 
we dedicate significant resources to promote the benefits and affordability of pool ownership  which we believe greatly benefits our swimming pool customers and suppliers 
we face intense competition both from within our industry and from other leisure product alternatives 
we face competition from both inside and outside of our industry 
within our industry  we compete against various regional and local distributors and  to a lesser extent  mass market retailers and large pool supply retailers 
outside of our industry  we compete with sellers of other leisure product alternatives  such as boats and motor homes  and with other companies who rely on discretionary homeowner expenditures  such as 
table of contents home remodelers 
new competitors may emerge as there are low barriers to entry in our industry 
some geographic markets that we serve  particularly our largest  higher density markets in california  florida  texas and arizona  representing approximately of our net sales in  also tend to be more competitive than others 
more aggressive competition by mass merchants could adversely affect our sales 
mass market retailers today carry a limited range of  and devote a limited amount of shelf space to  merchandise and products targeted to our industry 
historically  mass market retailers have generally expanded by adding new stores and product breadth  but their product offering of pool and landscape related products has remained relatively constant 
should mass market retailers increase their focus on the pool or professional landscape industries  or increase the breadth of their pool and landscape related product offerings  they may become a more significant competitor for direct and end use customers which could have an adverse impact on our business 
the demand for our swimming pool and related outdoor lifestyle products may be adversely affected by economic downturns 
in economic downturns  the demand for swimming pool or leisure related products may decline as discretionary consumer spending  the increase in pool eligible households and swimming pool construction decline 
although maintenance products and repair and replacement equipment that must be purchased by pool owners to maintain existing swimming pools account for more than of our gross profits  the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base  which may be viewed by most consumers as a discretionary expenditure that may be adversely affected by economic downturns 
we depend on key personnel 
we consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and success 
as such  our future success depends in large part on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  including our executive officers and key management personnel 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our operating results could be adversely affected 
specifically  our future success depends to an extent upon the continued service of manuel perez de la mesa  our chief executive officer 
the loss of mr 
perez de la mesa in particular could have a material adverse effect on our business 
mr 
perez de la mesa is not nearing retirement age  and we have no indication that he intends to retire in the near future 
we do not currently maintain key man insurance on mr 
perez de la mesa 
we may not be able to sustain our pace of growth 
we have experienced substantial sales growth in recent years through acquisitions and new service center openings that have increased our size  scope and geographic distribution 
since  we have opened new service centers and have completed acquisitions including our acquisition of horizon in october these acquisitions have added service centers  net of service center closings and consolidations  and a centralized shipping location to our distribution networks 
while we contemplate continued growth through acquisitions and internal expansion  no assurance can be made as to our ability to penetrate new markets  identify appropriate acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses  obtain financing  generate sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and general operating activities  maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships  and identify and divest assets which do not continue to create value consistent with our objectives 
if we do not manage these potential difficulties successfully  our operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents the growth of our business depends on effective marketing programs 
the growth of our business depends on the expansion of the installed pool base 
thus  an important part of our strategy is to promote the growth of the pool industry through our extensive advertising and promotional programs that attempt to raise consumer awareness regarding the benefits and affordability of pool ownership  the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool may be enjoyed beyond swimming 
these programs include media advertising  website development such as www 
swimmingpool 
com and public relations campaigns 
we believe these programs benefit the entire supply chain from our suppliers to our customers 
we also promote the growth of our customers businesses through comprehensive support programs that offer promotional tools and marketing support to help generate increased sales for our customers 
our programs include such things as personalized websites  brochures  marketing campaigns and business development training 
we also provide certain retail store customers with assistance in site selection  store layout and design and business management system implementation 
our inability to sufficiently develop effective advertising  marketing and promotional programs to succeed in a weakened economic environment and an increasingly competitive marketplace  in which we and our entire supply chain also compete with other luxury product alternatives  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business is highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales and of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year  which represent the peak months of swimming pool use  installation  remodeling and repair 
our sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters of the year  when we may incur net losses 
the nature of our business subjects us to compliance with environmental  health  transportation and safety regulations 
we are subject to regulation under federal  state and local environmental  health  transportation and safety requirements  which govern such things as packaging  labeling  handling  transportation  storage and sale of pool chemicals and landscape chemicals and fertilizers 
for example  we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the federal insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and various state pesticide laws 
these laws are primarily related to labeling  annual registration and licensing 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of injunctive relief 
moreover  compliance with such laws and regulations in the future could prove to be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will not incur such costs in material amounts 
these laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last years  and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes 
the clear trend in environmental  health  transportation and safety regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that impact the environment  such as the use and handling of chemical substances 
increasingly  strict restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us  and it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase 
we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and we will plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 
we store chemicals  fertilizers and other combustible materials that involve fire  safety and casualty risks 
we store chemicals and fertilizers  including certain combustible  oxidizing compounds  at our service centers 
a fire  explosion or flood affecting one of our facilities could give rise to fire  safety and casualty losses and related liability claims 
we maintain what we believe is prudent insurance protection 
however  we cannot guarantee that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
successful claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability 
in addition  changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage 

table of contents we conduct business internationally  which exposes us to additional risks 
our international operations expose us to certain additional risks  including difficulty in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  uncertain political and regulatory conditions  foreign currency fluctuations  adverse tax consequences and dependence on foreign economies 
we source certain products we sell  including our private label products  from asia and other foreign locations 
there is a significant risk that we may not be able to access products in a timely and efficient manner  and we may also be subject to certain trade restrictions that prevent us from obtaining products 
fluctuations in other factors relating to foreign trade  such as tariffs  currency exchange rates  transportation costs and inflation are beyond our control 
a terrorist attack or the threat of a terrorist attack could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the terrorist attacks that took place on september   in the us were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially impact our business 
discretionary spending on leisure products such as ours is generally adversely affected during times of economic uncertainty 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could adversely affect our business for the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted

for information about our recent acquisitions  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
the approximate increase in working capital from to is due primarily to a greater amount of early buy inventory purchases that we made and received during the fourth quarter of and the horizon acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by the deferral of our third and fourth quarter estimated federal income tax payments 
for further discussion  see the liquidity and capital resources section included in item of this form k 
the approximate decrease in working capital from to is due to the classification of our former revolving line of credit balance and the addition of short term financing

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial overview financial results our financial results reflect the continuing execution of our strategies for profitable revenue growth 
we have built on our core strengths with a focus on growing our customers businesses faster than the overall market and incrementally improving all aspects of our business operations 
net sales grew to billion in compared to billion in this is higher than the sales growth experienced in due primarily to the increase in our base business growth rate as well as fourth quarter sales from acquired service centers  which includes the horizon service centers acquired in october our base business growth has been relatively stable at  and for  and  respectively 
this growth contrasts with the growth of the overall market for swimming pool equipment and supplies  which we estimate grew on average from to per year over this same time period 
we attribute much of our growth to the success of the programs we offer to our customers  which are aimed at growing their businesses 
in  product pricing also contributed to the sales growth as we were able to pass most vendor price increases through to customers 
our gross profit as a percent of net sales gross margin decreased by approximately basis points in compared to  reflecting the impact of the divestiture of our north american manufacturing assets in december our operating income increased to million in due primarily to the growth in sales  as well as our ability to leverage our existing distribution and administrative infrastructure and our success with ongoing operational improvements 
net income increased in and included million of net equity earnings from our investment in latham acquisition corporation lac 
financial position and liquidity in  both our cash flow provided by operations and year end working capital balance were impacted by a greater amount of early buy inventory purchases that we received as of year end 
we made aggressive inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of to take advantage of price discounts and to mitigate the potential adverse gross margin impact of expected price increases 
as a result of the inventory purchases received and paid for in the fourth quarter of  which totaled approximately million  partially offset by the deferral of third and fourth quarter estimated federal income tax payments  our cash from operations decreased to million in from million in coupled with net proceeds from financing activities of approximately million  cash from operations helped fund our acquisition of horizon in the fourth quarter of  million of share repurchases in and the payment of our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders  which we increased in the second quarter of our year end inventory levels increased to million as of december   due primarily to our increased early buy inventory purchases and the horizon acquisition 
as a result of this increase  inventory turns decreased slightly to days in from days in days sales outstanding dso remained consistent between years at days for fiscal compared to days for fiscal we continue to maintain a healthy current ratio  which was down slightly to as of december  compared to as of december  
table of contents outlook we believe that the following factors will contribute to net sales growth in sales from acquired service centers  including horizon  expansion of our existing service centers through continued execution of our sales  marketing and service programs  the anticipated opening of to new service centers in  continued growth of the installed base of swimming pools  growth in complementary product sales  and expected product price increases passed through the supply chain 
we believe that complementary products will continue to grow at a faster rate than our overall sales growth  with an acceleration of the complementary products growth rate in the first three quarters of  compared to the same period in  due to the addition of horizon s products to our complementary product offerings 
including horizon s sales  complementary products should comprise approximately of net sales for the full year we expect to continue to increase our focus on supply chain management initiatives  including expansion of international sourcing and private label opportunities  particularly where margin expansion opportunities exist 
we also plan to make further advances in working capital management to achieve continued operational improvements in and beyond 
we expect a positive contribution from equity earnings from our investment in lac in lac s business is highly seasonal and more heavily weighted to northern markets  with the first and fourth quarters being the slowest parts of the year and the second and third quarters being the busiest 
we plan to use the modified retrospective transition method under sfas r  share based payment 
as such  we will adjust prior period financial statements beginning in the first quarter of to reflect the impact of stock option expense for amounts previously reported in our pro forma footnote disclosures required by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
our fully diluted earnings per share was as reported  or after adjusting for the impact of stock option expense 
we believe that earnings per share will be in the range of to per diluted share  including an expected impact from stock option expensing 
we believe that over the long term  we will generate sufficient cash flow and have adequate access to capital to both fund our business objectives and provide a direct return to our shareholders in the form of dividend payments 
our business is subject to significant risks  including weather  competition  general economic conditions and other risks as detailed in item a of this form k 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management identifies critical accounting estimates as those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  and those for which changes in the estimate or assumptions  or the use of different estimates and assumptions  could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates require us to make the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for an estimate of the losses we will incur if our customers do not make required payments 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral 
consistent with industry practices  we require payment from our customers within days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers 
the extended terms require payments in equal installments in april  may and june or may and june  depending on geographical location 
in the past  credit losses have been within or better than our expectations 
as our business is seasonal  our customers businesses are also seasonal 
sales are lowest in the winter months  and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time 
we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from for amounts currently due up to for specific accounts more than days past due 
at the end of each year  we perform a reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than  additionally  we perform a separate reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging 
as we review these past due accounts  we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors  including aging statistics and trends  customer payment history  independent credit reports  and discussions with customers 
during the year  we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 
such write offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the past five years  write offs have averaged less than of net sales 
if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by at december   pretax income would change by approximately million and earnings per share would change by approximately per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  inventory obsolescence product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet 
our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stock outs to provide the highest level of service to our customers 
to do this  we maintain at each service center an adequate inventory of stock keeping units skus with the highest sales volume 
at the same time  we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory  which are not as critical to our customers and thus  inherently have lower velocity 
service centers classify products into classes based on sales at that location over the past months 
the table below presents a description of these inventory classes classes highest sales value items  which represent approximately of net sales at the service center classes lower sales value items  which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service class products with no sales for the past twelve months or special order products not yet delivered to the customer 
table of contents there is little risk of obsolescence for products in classes because products in these classes generally turn quickly 
we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes  which we believe represent some exposure to inventory obsolescence  with particular emphasis on skus with the least sales over the previous months 
the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit 
we provide a reserve of for inventory in classes as determined at the service center level 
we also provide an additional reserve for excess inventory in classes and an additional reserve for excess inventory in class we determine excess inventory  which is defined as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous months usage  on a company wide basis 
in evaluating the adequacy of our reserve for inventory obsolescence  we consider a combination of factors including the level of inventory in relationship to historical sales by product  including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the service center and company levels  changes in customer preferences  seasonal fluctuations in inventory levels  geographical location  and new product offerings 
our reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as changes occur in the above identified factors 
if the balance of our inventory reserve increased or decreased by at december   pretax income would change by approximately million and earnings per share would change by approximately per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  vendor rebates we account for vendor rebates in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount of consideration  payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures  generally related to the volume level of purchases from our vendors 
we account for such rebates as if they are a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product  at which time such rebates reduce cost of sales in our income statement 
throughout the year  we estimate the amount of the rebate earned based on our estimate of purchases to date relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the rebates 
we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels 
if market conditions were to change  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
although such changes would not affect the amounts we have recorded related to product already purchased  it may lower or raise our gross margins on products we sell or revenues earned in future periods 
incentive compensation accrual we have an incentive compensation structure designed to attract  motivate and retain employees 
our incentive compensation packages include bonus plans that are specific to each group of eligible participants and their levels and areas of responsibility 
the majority of our bonus plans have annual cash payments that are based primarily on objective performance criteria  with a small component based on management s discretion 
we calculate bonuses as a percentage of salaries based on the achievement of certain key measurable financial and operational results  including budgeted operating income and diluted earnings per share 
we generally make bonus payments at the end of february following the most recent completed fiscal year 

table of contents the objectives for our bonus plans are set at the inception of the bonus plan year using both historical information and forecasted results of operations for the current plan year 
we record an incentive compensation accrual as of each month end using management s estimate of the total overall incentives earned based on the amount of progress achieved towards the stated bonus plan objectives 
during the third and fourth quarters and as of our fiscal year end  we adjust our estimated incentive compensation accrual based on our detailed analysis of each bonus plan  the participants progress toward achievement of their specific bonus plan objectives and management s estimates related to the discretionary components of the bonus plans 
due to both the discretionary components of the bonus plans and the timing of the approval and payment of the annual bonuses  our estimated quarterly incentive compensation expense and accrual balances may vary relative to actual annual bonus expense and payouts 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
due to changing tax laws and state income tax rates  significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future 
as of december   and in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes  united states taxes were not provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we have invested or expect to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely 
if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states  or if we determine that the earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  additional tax provisions may be required 
we hold  through our affiliates  cash balances in the countries in which we operate  including substantial amounts held outside the united states 
most of the amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states  but  under current law  may be subject to united states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws including the imposition of withholding taxes in some jurisdictions 
the american jobs creation act of the jobs act provided for a temporary dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our analysis of the costs and benefits of repatriating funds under the jobs act and decided not to repatriate any of our foreign earnings 
therefore  there was no impact from the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 
we have operations in states and seven foreign countries 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to adjustment by the applicable tax authorities 
we are subject to regular audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
these adjustments may include differences between the estimated deferred tax liability that we have recorded for equity earnings in unconsolidated investments and the actual taxes paid upon the return of undistributed equity earnings through a manner other than a capital transaction 
as a result of these uncertainties  our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired  less liabilities assumed 
at december   our goodwill balance was million  representing of total assets and of stockholders equity 

table of contents we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these rules  we test goodwill for impairment annually or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
in october  we performed our annual goodwill impairment test  which requires comparison of our estimated fair value to our book value  including goodwill 
as a result of this test  we believe the goodwill on our balance sheet is not impaired 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our fair market value has fallen below book value  we will compare the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its book value 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill  we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income

net sales year ended december  in millions change net sales base business growth of contributed to the increase in net sales  primarily due to the following a larger installed base of swimming pools resulting in increased sales of non discretionary products  price increases  which were passed through the supply chain  the continued successful execution of our sales  marketing and service programs  growth in complementary product sales 

table of contents new product initiatives continue to be focused on our complementary products category  for which sales have grown from million in to over million in  excluding horizon 
in  complementary product sales grew over these products  which our customers historically purchased from other suppliers  carry gross margins comparable to our traditional product categories

gross margin decreased to in primarily due to a decrease of approximately basis points related to the disposition of our north american manufacturing assets in december we also had a slight decrease in gross margin due to the impact of certain product price increases 
supplier price increases were much more pronounced in than in prior years due to significant price increases on certain chemicals used in the pool industry  as well as increases in underlying commodity costs  particularly oil and steel 
in certain product categories  we were only able to pass along price increases on a dollar per unit basis rather than a percentage basis due to competitive pressures 
the overall decrease in gross margin was partially offset by improvements achieved through our focus on supply chain management and a shift in product mix to our higher margin products  most notably in the fourth quarter 
operating expenses year ended december  in millions change operating expenses operating expenses as a percent of net sales operating expenses as a percent of net sales decreased basis points in as increases in employee related costs and freight expenses were offset by our ability to leverage much of our existing distribution infrastructure and personnel base to support our sales growth 
interest expense net interest expense increased to million in from million as a result of an increase in the effective interest rate to in from in and a increase in the average debt outstanding 
the increase in the interest rate and higher average debt outstanding was partially offset by a million decrease in the amortization of deferred financing fees 
income taxes income taxes increased to million in from million in primarily due to the million increase in income before income taxes 
our effective income tax rate decreased from at december  to at december  this decrease is due to the anticipated impact of certain tax advantaged business strategies

table of contents net income and earnings per share net income increased to million in from million while diluted earnings per share increased to per share in from per share in seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is highly seasonal 
in general  sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters  which represent the peak months of both swimming pool use and installation and landscape installations and maintenance 
sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses 
in  approximately of our net sales and of our operating income were generated in the second and third quarters of the year 
we typically experience a build up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season 
excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases  our peak borrowing usually occurs during the second quarter  primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april  may and june  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june  july and august 
the following table presents certain unaudited quarterly data for and we have included income statement and balance sheet data for the most recent eight quarters to allow for a meaningful comparison of the seasonal fluctuations in these amounts 
in our opinion  this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
due to the seasonal nature of the swimming pool industry  the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends

we attempt to open new service centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the following peak selling season 

table of contents weather is the principal external factor affecting our business 
the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions 
weather possible effects hot and dry increased purchases of chemicals and supplies for existing swimming pools increased purchases of above ground pools and irrigation products unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary amounts of rain fewer pool and landscape installations decreased purchases of chemicals and supplies decreased purchases of impulse items such as above ground pools and accessories unseasonably early warming trends primarily in the northern half of the us a longer pool and landscape season  thus increasing our sales unseasonably late warming trends primarily in the northern half of the us a shorter pool and landscape season  thus decreasing our sales in  our sales were negatively impacted by a late start to the pool season in northern markets due to less than favorable weather throughout much of the first quarter 
this decrease in sales was partially off set by increased sales attributable to above average temperatures during the fourth quarter of  which helped to extend the pool season in certain markets 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet current cash needs 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities  taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business 
significant factors which could affect our liquidity include the following cash flows generated from operating activities  the adequacy of available bank lines of credit  acquisitions  the timing and extent of share repurchases  capital expenditures  dividend payments  and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions  share repurchases and dividend payments 
our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings  which combined with seller financing have historically been sufficient to support our growth and finance our acquisitions 
the same principle applies for funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures 
our priorities for the use of cash are as follows maintenance and new service center capital expenditures estimated at to of net sales  strategic acquisitions executed opportunistically  payment of cash dividends as and when declared by the board  repurchase of common stock at board defined parameters  and repayment of debt 

table of contents sources and uses of cash our cash from operations was million  or of net income  compared to net cash provided by operations of million in the decrease in cash from operations in is primarily a result of our participation in vendor early payment incentives for early buy purchases received and paid for in the fourth quarter  partially offset by the deferral of our third and fourth quarter estimated federal tax payments and higher net income 
in  cash used in investing activities included million for our acquisition of horizon in the fourth quarter of our financing activities included million of net proceeds from debt and the issuance of common stock under stock option plans  offset by million of share repurchases and million for the payment of our quarterly cash dividend to shareholders  which we increased in the second quarter of the impact of our common stock repurchases reduced diluted weighted average shares outstanding by approximately million shares for the year ended december  future sources and uses of cash on december   we amended our unsecured syndicated senior credit facility the credit facility to provide for additional borrowing capacity 
the amended credit facility  which matures on december   provides for a million five year revolving credit facility the revolver and a million term loan the term loan 
the credit facility includes sublimits for the issuance of swingline loans and standby letters of credit 
the aggregate maximum principal amount of the commitments under the credit facility may be increased from time to time by a total amount up to million 
at december   there was million outstanding and million available for borrowing under the revolver 
the average effective interest rate on the revolver was approximately for the year ended december  for additional information regarding the credit facility  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k 
in march  we renewed our accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility  which provides a seasonal borrowing capacity of up to million  through march the receivables facility provides for the true sale of certain of our receivables as they are created to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
this subsidiary grants an undivided security interest in the receivables to an unrelated commercial paper conduit 
because of the structure of the bankruptcy remote subsidiary and our ability to control its activities  we include the transferred receivables and related debt in our consolidated balance sheet 
we employed this arrangement because it provides us with a lower cost form of financing 
at december   there was million outstanding under the receivables facility at an average effective interest rate of 
on february   million remained available under the authorization of our board of directors for future share repurchases 
we intend to continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time  depending on market conditions 
we may use cash flows from operations to fund these purchases  or we may incur additional debt 
in the third quarter of  our cash flows will be negatively impacted by payment of our third and fourth quarter estimated federal tax payments that have been deferred as allowed by the katrina emergency tax relief act of the act 
these payments  which were originally deferred until february under the act  will now be due in august  as the internal revenue service has postponed the payment deadline for affected taxpayers 
we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and anticipated growth  including expansion in existing and targeted market areas 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and hold discussions with acquisition candidates 
if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing  we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms 
additionally  we may issue common or preferred stock to raise funds 

table of contents contractual obligations at december   our contractual obligations for long term debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands total payments due by period less than year years years years and thereafter long term debt short term financing operating leases item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our debt 
if i the variable rates on our credit facility and our receivables facility increased or decreased from the rate at december   and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available under the credit facility million and the receivables facility million for all of  then our pretax income would change by approximately million and earnings per share would change by per diluted share based on the number of weighed average diluted shares outstanding at december  the fair value of our revolver is not affected by changes in market interest rates 
in december  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan 
the swap will be in effect as of june  and terminate on december  foreign exchange risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in canada  mexico  the united kingdom  france  portugal  spain and italy 
in the past  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure  and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results 
future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues  operating expenses and earnings 
due to the size of our foreign operations  however  we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in functional currencies canada canadian dollar mexico peso united kingdom british pound france euro portugal euro spain euro italy euro
