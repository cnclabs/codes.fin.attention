executive overview embarcadero technologies  inc is a leading provider of strategic data management solutions that help companies to improve the availability  integrity  accessibility  and security of corporate data 
we earn revenues from the worldwide sale of these software solutions and related maintenance and support services to corporations  government agencies  educational institutions  and other entities 
information technology it budgets  as well as macroeconomic conditions  affect demand for our products 
in addition  our sales are impacted by competitive conditions  market acceptance of our product offerings  and our ability to execute our sales plans successfully 
we have historically derived a significant percentage of our revenues from our dbartisan product line 
for the twelve months ended december   dbartisan and dbartisan add on products accounted for more than of our license revenues 
this product line is expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result of this revenue concentration  our business could be harmed by a decline in demand for this product or its related product line 
our products support the most widely used database and os platforms  including oracle  microsoft sql server  ibm db universal database  mysql  and sybase  running in unix  windows nt  and linux environments 
from to the first half of  global economic conditions had a negative impact on it spending which affected sales of our products 
in the second half of and in  there were improvements in the fundamentals of our market and broader acceptance of our core and new products 
however  in the first quarter of  primarily due to an unexpected slowdown in closure rates of sales transactions in the united states that may have been company specific or a result of macroeconomic changes  and also due to the organizational disruption in our uk subsidiary related to our audit committee investigation  we did not meet our revenue projections and total revenues decreased to million for the three months ended march  but  with the stabilization of our uk operation in the second quarter  total revenue increased to million 
with the improvement in enterprise and commercial sales in north america  total revenue reached million for the three months ended september  in the fourth quarter  owing to better sales execution in north american coupled with higher closure rates internationally  revenue for the three months ended december  increased to million and million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million and million for the corresponding period in most of our operating expenses are related to personnel and related overhead costs  facilities  outside research and development contractors  and legal and other professional service costs 
the operating expenditures for the three and twelve months ended december  were million and million  respectively  compared to million and million for the three and twelve months ended december

our cash flow from operations was approximately million and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  during the twelve months ended december   we repurchased million of the company s common stock under the company s stock repurchase program 
our license and maintenance revenues  results of operations  cash flows from operations  and financial condition could be adversely affected in future periods by a renewed downturn in global economic conditions  increased competitive pressures or our own inability to execute on our sales plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the impacts and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those items that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
below is further discussion of the items that we consider to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are principally derived from software license sales and related maintenance and support contracts 
customers that license our software products also generally purchase maintenance and support contracts that provide software updates and technical support over a stated term  usually one year 
revenues from maintenance and support contracts are paid for in advance and are recognized ratably over the contract term 
we primarily sell packaged software products that generally do not require us to perform any special installation or integration services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  typically upon shipment  when terms are fob shipping point  no significant implementation obligations by us remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we use a purchase order  a pre payment via check  wire or credit card  a signed license agreement  or other persuasive evidence as substantiation of an arrangement 
when processing a sales transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are typically days from invoice date but in some cases may be or days  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
most customers are granted payment terms  but some payments are collected via check  wire  or credit card at the time an order is placed 
for arrangements with multiple elements eg  hardware and software products  undelivered maintenance and support contracts and consulting and training services bundled with licenses  we allocate revenue to the delivered elements of the arrangement using the residual value method based on their fair value 
under the residual value method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair 
table of contents value for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for the licenses is based upon the prices paid for separate renewal of those services by similar customers 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for other services  primarily consulting and training services  is based upon separate sales of such services 
deferred revenue  which consists primarily of maintenance and support services that customers have contracted for in advance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term  typically one year 
other deferred revenue typically relates to consulting and training services and is recognized as services are rendered or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
our products are typically sold under a perpetual license model 
updates and upgrades to our products are made available to customers who have purchased maintenance and support contracts 
we do not recognize revenues for refundable fees or agreements with cancellation rights until such rights to refund or cancellation have expired 
our products may be sold through distributors or resellers in the united states and certain international markets 
revenues from software license fees sold through distributors or resellers are recognized on the sell through basis 
maintenance revenue sold through distributors and resellers is recognized ratably over the contractual post contract service pcs period 
distributors and resellers purchase products to fulfill specific customer orders and generally do not hold inventory of our products 
we also enter into arrangements with oems that provide for license fees based on inclusion of our products in their products 
these arrangements often provide for non refundable and upfront minimum royalty payments which are recognized as revenue either immediately or on a sell through basis when due  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the oem arrangements usually include maintenance and support contracts 
we allocate revenues to the delivered elements of the arrangements using the residual value method based on the vsoe for undelivered items 
we intend to continue to expand our international sales activities in an effort to increase revenues from foreign sales 
we sell our software and related maintenance services directly through our telesales and field sales organizations in north america  the united kingdom and australia and indirectly through our distribution partners worldwide 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made in connection with the determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on our review of credit profiles of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  current economic trends and historical payment  return and discount experience 
we reassess the allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts each period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  unexpected events or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to our future statements of operations and of cash flows 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue or bad debt expense recognized could result 
our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of activities during the years reported 
based on our results for the year ended december   a one percentage point deviation in our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in an increase or decrease in revenue and or expense of approximately  capitalized research and development costs 
capitalized research and development costs include certain costs associated with acquiring and developing technology used in our licensed products 
research and development costs are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  which requires capitalization of research and development costs once technological feasibility has been established through such time as the related product is generally available for sale 
we consider technological feasibility to have been established when a working model that includes 
table of contents all significant planned features and functionality exists 
accordingly  purchased technology is capitalized if it has reached technological feasibility at the time of acquisition  costs of developed technology are capitalized after technological feasibility is reached 
costs of purchased and developed technology are capitalized and amortized on a product by product basis over their remaining estimated useful lives at the greater of straight line or the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product 
amortization begins when technology is available for sale 
estimated useful lives of capitalized technology are generally three years 
our capitalized software costs were million  net at december  a discussion of our policies related to capitalized software can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading capitalized software development costs and further detail can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
lease related impairment loss 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in we recorded a restructuring charge in connection with our abandonment of certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
lease abandonment costs were estimated to include the impairment of leasehold improvements  remaining net present value of the company s future contractual lease obligations  net of any sublease income and brokerage fees 
in  based on changes in the commercial real estate market in san francisco  we recorded an additional impairment charges to cover lower than estimated sublease income 
further  in  we recorded a second restructuring and impairment charge of million related to the consolidation of our office leases in san francisco 
the restructuring charge is primarily based on the net present value of the company s future contractual lease obligations net of any sublease income and any incidental expenses related to restructuring 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions about the time period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees as well as the sublease rates that can be achieved  as determined by market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage we retained 
we will continue to review these estimates each reporting period 
to the extent that these assumptions change due to unfavorable market conditions  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could increase 
accounting for income taxes 
in conjunction with preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a given period  we must increase the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  consisting of colorado net operating loss and canadian r d credit carryforwards  we established a valuation allowance of approximately  the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of current and future taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
a detailed discussion of our income tax provision and the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for deferred stock based compensation 
our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement 
table of contents principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
deferred stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income loss  as some options and stock awards granted under those plans had an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  which is described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we amortize stock based compensation using the multiple option method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options and stock awards  which are generally four years 
pro forma information regarding net income loss and earnings per share is required in order to show our net income loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options and awards under the fair value method of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 and is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of options and stock awards issued pursuant to the option plans at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net income loss and earnings per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net income loss and earnings per share in the future years for the following reasons the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly 
starting january  the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the new pronouncement issued in december replaces the existing requirements under sfas no 
and apb according to sfas no 
r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  would be treated the same as any other form of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations 
this pronouncement eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using apb no 
and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
fasb concluded that for public companies sfas no 
r is effective for awards and stock options granted  modified or settled in cash in interim or annual periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r provides transition alternatives for public companies to restate prior interim periods or prior years 
the company expects the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
we cannot quantify the amount of such impact at this time

the increase in total revenue from to is due to a general increase in information technology spending and better sales execution in north america 
license 
license revenue decreased in compared to the decrease was due to a significant decrease in license revenues generated by our uk subsidiary in the increase in license revenue in compared to is a result of better information technology spending environment and increased license revenue generated in the north america region

we expect there to be amortization of acquired technology expense in related to ambeo and technology purchased in maintenance 
cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of customer support personnel and related expenses  including payroll  employee benefits  and allocated overhead 
the decrease in cost of maintenance from to was due to decreased salaries and wages resulting from lower head count 
the decrease in cost of maintenance as a percentage of revenues from to was due primarily to the increase in maintenance revenues from period to period while the number of related personnel remained flat  allowing us to realize economies of scale through increased utilization of our customer support personnel 
we expect to hire more support personnel to support our expanding product line  increased level of services and customer base 
when we hire such personnel  we expect cost of maintenance revenues to increase in absolute dollars and potentially to increase as a percentage of maintenance revenues if the additional personnel are hired in advance of an increase in the related revenues

the increase of from to was a result of increased headcount and recruiting related in both domestic and canadian development teams as well as a write off of  of in progress r d acquired as part of the ambeo acquisition completed in october research and develop expenses increased as headcount shifted to canada 
the slight increase in compared to is due to decrease of  in domestic costs from lower headcount and a reduced overhead expense allocation based on our restructuring in the second quarter of  offset by  higher canadian development lab costs due to increased operating costs including an unfavorable currency exchange cost of  we anticipate that we will continue to invest significant resources into research and development activities in order to develop new products and advance the technology of our existing products

the remaining  consists of write downs to leasehold improvements and other assets attributable to the abandoned space  as well as other expenses related to securing the sublease arrangements 
when we recorded the lease related impairment loss  we made estimates about sublease costs and income 
in  based on changes in the commercial real estate market in san francisco  we recorded an additional  in impairment loss to cover lower than expected sublease income 
at december   we had a balance of  in accrued restructuring costs for future facilities lease charges

provision for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
provision for income taxes was million   and million in  and respectively 
the effective income tax rate was  and in  and respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to is primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes  and amortization expenses resulting from acquisition and stock based compensation amortization deductible for book but not tax purposes 
the decrease from to was primarily due to the decrease in income before taxes and a benefit received from disqualifying dispositions of employee stock options for which stock based compensation was recognized in previous periods 
the exercise and sale of incentive stock options typically creates disqualifying dispositions which benefits the overall corporate tax rate 
it is impossible to forecast the exercise of our outstanding common stock options or the disqualifying dispositions associated with them 
the benefits received from the disqualifying dispositions can only be considered in calculating a company s tax rate in the period in which they are realized 
in the past  our effective tax rate has been reduced due to the occurrence of such disqualifying dispositions 
we had net deferred tax assets totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards nols of approximately million and million  respectively 
these nols can be carried forward to offset future taxable income  if any 
our federal and state net operating loss carry forwards expire in through  if not utilized 
at december   we had federal  state and foreign research and development credits of approximately million   and  respectively 
the federal credits expire in through the state credits and foreign credits do not expire 
we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we will adjust such estimates in the future periods  and we may also need to adjust the effective rate for the current year

the million increase in operating assets is offset by an equal increase in operating liabilities 
in  cash provided by operating activities resulted from million in net income  million in non cash adjustments primarily comprised of depreciation  amortization and deferred stock based compensation charges  as well as a million net change in operating assets and liabilities 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to an increase in accrued restructuring charge of million related to our restructuring in the second quarter of and an increase of million in deferred revenue due a larger installed customer base and related increase in maintenance renewals 
to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
the non cash adjustments include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets  as well as amortization of deferred stock based compensation and tax benefits for the exercise of certain employee stock options 
these non cash adjustments may increase or decrease and  as a result  positively or negatively impact our future operating results 
in  the non cash adjustments were mainly due to million in non cash stock based compensation expense  million in amortization of developed technology  million in amortization of acquired technology  million in amortization of other intangibles  and million of write down of acquired intangibles and internally developed software 
other than non cash items  our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collections efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable daily sales outstanding dso 
collection of accounts receivable and related dso could fluctuate in the future periods due to timing and amount of our revenues and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
in the future  collections could also fluctuate based upon the payment terms we extend to our customers 
in the past  our payment terms have typically been net thirty days 
our dso for the three months ended december   and were days  days and days  respectively 
our operating cash flows may be impacted in the future by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we typically pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with their invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the nature of accounts payable arrangements and management s assessment of our cash inflows

further  we have approximately million shares available to issue under our current plans 
the timing of the issuance  the duration of their vesting provision and the grant price will all impact the timing of any proceeds 
however  we cannot estimate the amount of such proceeds at this time 
furthermore  the company suspended all exercises of stock options under each of its equity compensation plans from november  through january  this suspension was required because the company s periodic reports are incorporated by reference into the registration statements for the securities issuable under each such equity compensation plan 
the company extended the exercisability of all options that would otherwise have terminated during that period for a period of time equal to that during which the options were not exercisable due to the suspension 
this extension did not have a material impact on our cash flows 
in august  we terminated our million revolving credit facility with a financial institution 
we did not intend to utilize this line of credit due to our liquidity position 
the financial institution issued an irrevocable standby letter of credit for approximately  in relation to a real estate lease agreement executed in april the standby letter of credit expires on june  
table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations consisted of facility lease commitments  operating leases for office equipment  and capital leases for property and equipment 
in april  we announced a restructuring plan  and  as a part of that plan  we entered in to a new five year lease commitment and subleased the remainder of our long term san francisco office leases 
gross lease payment obligations under the non cancelable operating and capital lease are as follows in thousands year ending december  capital lease operating leases bank letter of credit total thereafter total minimum payments less amount representing interest present value of net minimum lease payments we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations through at least the next to months 
if we fail to generate cash flow from operations in the future due to an unexpected decline in revenues or due to a sustained increase in cash expenditures in excess of revenues generated  our cash balances may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations without obtaining additional financing 
if additional financing is needed  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss

fsp fas is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we are required to adopt fsp fas in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect that the adoption of the statement will have a material impact on our consolidated results or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no

accounting changes and sfas no

table of contents in december  fasb issued sfas r  share based payment revised  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 providing supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
in april  the sec issued amendment to rule a of regulation s x regarding the compliance date for statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment the amendment to rule a  changing the effective date for most public companies to adopt sfas r to the first interim reporting period of a company s fiscal year that begins on or after june  under the amendment to rule a  we are now required to adopt sfas r in our first quarter of fiscal year sfas r requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an acceptable alternative to recognition of expense in the financial statements 
sfas r also provides three alternative transition methods for its first adoption 
up to the end of fiscal year  we had measured compensation costs related to share based payments under apb and as allowed by sfas  and provided pro forma disclosure in notes to our financial statements as required by sfas on adoption of sfas r  we will use the modified prospective application transition method 
sfas r also requires a classification change in the statement of cash flows  whereby a portion of the tax benefits from stock options will be moved from cash from operating activities to cash from financing activities  without changing the total cash flows 
we are still in the process of finalizing our study on the impact of applying various other provisions of sfas r 
we expect the adoption of sfas r  sab and related pronouncements  will have a materially adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
however  we currently cannot accurately estimate the effect of such impact  as such costs will fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
in december  fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment to apb opinion no 

this statement amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio  which at december  included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately million 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
from time to time  some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  marketable securities in money market funds  tax exempt municipal auction rate securities and tax exempt municipal bonds 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio 
based on our portfolio at december   if interest rates were to change by  interest income could be impacted positively or negatively by approximately  on an annualized basis 
there would be no material impact on the fair market value of the portfolio 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market accounts  tax exempt municipal auction rate securities and tax exempt municipal bonds 
foreign exchange risk our operations are conducted primarily in the united states and are denominated in united states dollars 
a small but growing portion of our sales originate through our european subsidiary and are denominated in pounds sterling 
with respect to such sales  revenues are collected and operating expenses are generally paid in pounds sterling 
accordingly  we are exposed to volatility in sales and earnings within europe due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in pound sterling  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in pound sterling 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
in addition  our european operations in some instances act as a natural hedge because both operating expenses and sales are denominated in local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of pound sterling against the us dollar will result in lower sales when translated to us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to changing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility when compared to the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors
