item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacture and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  entertainment  military  medical and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of two segments the manufacture and distribution of monitors  projection systems and crt displays and the wholesale distribution of consumer electronic parts 
the display segment is organized into four interrelated operations aggregated into one operating segment pursuant to the aggregation criteria of sfas monitors offers a wide range of crt  flat panel and projection display systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical and industrial applications 
data display offers a wide range of crts for use in data display screens  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
home entertainment offers a wide range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
components provides replacement electron guns and other components for crts primarily for servicing the company s internal needs 
fiscal highlights monitor division revenue the company continues to focus its growth efforts on various niche markets within the defense  medical and projection display industries 
net sales within this division decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the fulfillment of a military contract for replacement dvsts at the lexel facility earlier in fiscal  which has not been renewed 
this decline was partially offset by sales of the evans sutherland product line acquired in november  which was consolidated with the company s display systems operations in cape canaveral  fl 
data display division revenue the company s data display division sales increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal sales earlier in fiscal included a larger concentration of lower priced replacement crts compared to the prior year period 
late in fiscal  the company began distributing projection tubes from its data display location in tucker  ga 
these projection units carry a higher sales price per unit than the company s normal inventory 
acquisition during the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired the ids division of three five systems  inc  consisting of inventory and certain assets 
this newly acquired business operates from leased facilities in marlboro  massachusetts as a division of the company s aydin display systems operations 
new credit facility in april  the company finalized a new line of credit at fox international  ltd fox to replace a prior facility 
under the terms of this new facility  the company paid off the existing line of credit as well as a mortgage securing the land and building of fox 
the maximum amount available for borrowings under this new line is million compared to approximately million under the prior facility 
proceeds from this line are available for working capital needs of the company

fiscal challenges inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected future needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crts and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
the company s inventory turnover averages over days  although in many cases the company would anticipate holding to days of inventory in the normal course of operations 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors due to the fact that it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining and  as manufacturers for these products discontinue production or exit the business  the company may make last time buys 
in the monitor operations of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by fairly rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers or accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to its vendors 
because of this  the company s management monitors the adequacy of its inventory reserves regularly  and at february   believes its reserves to be adequate 
interest rate exposure the company had outstanding debt of approximately million as of february  which is subject to interest rate fluctuations by the company s lenders 
higher rates applied by the federal reserve board during fiscal have negatively affected the company s earnings and the potential for continued rate hikes may negatively impact the company s future earnings 
it is the intent of the company to continually monitor interest rates and consider converting portions of the company s debt from floating rates to fixed rates should conditions be favorable for such interest rate swaps or hedges 
prior period restatement during preparation of the third quarter fiscal financial statements  the company discovered an error in its accounting for the treatment of foreign subsidiary losses for income tax purposes in the fiscal year ended february  and certain non income tax based franchise taxes in the fiscal year ended february  and several prior fiscal years 
a clerical error in the calculation of the tax effects of foreign losses resulted in an understatement of the company s fiscal consolidated provision for income taxes by approximately  in addition  for several years  the company has applied the payment of non income based franchise taxes against income taxes payable 
due to improper income taxes payable account reconciliation procedures  this error was not detected 
the company did not recognize general and administrative expense when the franchise taxes were paid 
proper recognition of these franchise taxes in general and administrative expenses reduces reported net income by approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal and years prior 
these adjustments did not have a material impact on reported cash flows 
the effect of these errors on reported net income is summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year prior net income  previously reported general and administrative expense  net of income taxes provision for income taxes net effect of adjustments net income  as restated diluted earnings per share of common stock  previously reported diluted earnings per share of common stock  as restated management has determined that the error was the result of a control deficiency with respect to the company s procedures in calculating and reporting its franchise tax and the treatment of foreign losses in the provision for income taxes under fasb statement no 
 and the proper reconciliation of those items to related consolidated balance sheet accounts 
management believes that this control deficiency constituted a material weakness 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or a combination of control deficiencies  that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
the company has recently employed additional experienced financial staff  as reported in its form k filed december   to address this weakness and has amended its procedures for the preparation and review of recorded income tax amounts included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has reviewed the impact of these errors on reported results of operations for the years affected  utilizing criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin  including the qualitative and quantitative elements outlined in that statement 
management has determined that the impact of this adjustment in each of the years affected is not material to reported results of operations on either a qualitative or quantitative basis in the respective years 
based on this determination  the company does not plan to re file its annual report on form k for fiscal operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages which selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues amounts in thousands see item business description of principal business and principal products for discussion about the company s products and divisions

amount amount amount sales display segment monitors data display crts entertainment crts electron guns andcomponents total display segment wholesale distribution segment costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling and delivery general and administrative income from operations interest expense other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales increased million for fiscal or compared to fiscal net sales 
this includes a display segment sales increase of million or and a wholesale distribution segment sales increase of million or for the comparative periods 
the net increase in display segment sales in fiscal represents a million decline in monitor revenues  a million decline in home entertainment crt revenues and a million decline in component distribution revenues  offset by an increase in data display crt revenues of million compared to fiscal decreases in monitor revenues primarily reflect a reduction in crt and dvst sales at lexel  teltron and xkd of million during fiscal compared to fiscal as contracts were fulfilled  but have not been replaced 
the timing of orders for these contracts  many which are military related  are affected by a number of factors  including competitive bidding  government budgetary issues  the phase out and replacement of military field units and the life cycle of individual display units 
sales of other crt products from lexel are supported by a backlog of million at february  during fiscal  the teltron and xkd operations were consolidated with the aydin displays operation 
the company plans to further consolidate the crt related portion of aydin displays into the lexel operation during fiscal this decrease in crt and dvst sales was partially offset by a net increase in sales of flat panel and projector display units at display systems and aydin displays of million during fiscal  compared to fiscal  through contracts with boeing co  lockheed martin and various other customers 
increases in data display revenues are attributed primarily to management s decision in late fiscal to begin distributing commercial and military projection tube displays from its data display location in tucker  georgia 
these projection tube displays carry a higher sales price per unit than the units historically distributed from this facility 
the decline in entertainment crt sales reflects management s decision in late fiscal to move the distribution of projection tube displays from the novatron operation to its data display distribution facility  which is a part of the data display division  and reduced sales at the novatron and chroma operations due to weaker demand in the television tube replacement market 
during fiscal  the magnaview operation was relocated and merged into the chroma facility 
the company is the primary supplier of replacement television crts to the domestic entertainment market 
a significant portion of the entertainment division s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets to  fewer extended warranties were sold by retailers  a trend consistent with recent prior fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of product to meet manufacturers standard warranties 
growth in this division will be negatively impacted by the decreasing number of extended warranties sold for the larger  more expensive sets 
the decline in component parts sales reflects weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales at the southwest vacuum and wintron operations 
electron gun sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined over the past few years as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
the company s wintron location is continuing its transition  focusing growth efforts on the distribution of two newer camera technologies  which is expected to reduce dependence on sales of components for crts 
one such technology will assist border guards with under car inspections and another will assist correctional facilities with the supervision of inmates 
if successful  the company believes these new technologies will have a positive impact on the component division sales 
the modest increase in anticipated wholesale distribution segment sales are attributed to growth in call center sales 
the call center operations of fox international were relocated and expanded during fiscal to provide the capacity to seek additional call center business in future periods 
gross margins consolidated gross profit margins declined from for the year ended february  to for the fiscal year ended february  display segment margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the wholesale distribution segment margins before call center expenses improved from for the year ended february  to for the year ended february  within the display segment  monitor gross margins decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal this decrease is primarily attributed to higher than anticipated costs to complete certain product contracts acquired in the three five acquisition  costs to relocate and combine the xkd operation into aydin displays  and lower margins generated and lower absorption of fixed overhead costs in the lexel and teltron operations at their reduced level of sales 
data display gross margins decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal  due to price competition and reduced demand for non projection crt tubes and an increase in the provision for obsolete inventory over the prior year 
gross margins in home entertainment crts decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to lower absorption of fixed overhead costs at their reduced level of sales 
gross margins from component parts sold also decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal due to the impact of lower sales volume and charges for inventory obsolescence 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from for fiscal to for fiscal display segment operating expenses increased million or during fiscal compared to fiscal  while operating expenses for the wholesale distribution segment increased million or for the comparable periods 
within the display segment  which includes the majority of corporate level expenses for the consolidated group  the increase is primarily due to increased accounting and legal fees associated with financial regulatory reporting and work on potential acquisition projects  which have subsequently been abandoned 
wholesale distribution segment operating expenses increased due to added labor and overhead costs associated with the expansion of the call center in the second half of fiscal sales growth for services provided by the expanded call center was slower than anticipated  consequently staffing was reduced near the end of fiscal to correspond with projected near term call center needs and reduce operating costs 
interest expense interest expense increased million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal  due to a higher level of average outstanding borrowings and higher market interest rates 
the company maintains various debt agreements with variable interest rates  most of which are based on libor or the prime rate 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal  reflecting the impact of permanent differences in taxable income at the lower level of earnings 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales increased million for fiscal or compared to fiscal net sales 
the display segment increased million or while the wholesale distribution segment increased million or for the comparative periods 
the net increase in display segment sales in fiscal is attributed to continued growth in monitor revenues of million  as well as increases within the data display revenues of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
there were offsetting declines within the home entertainment and component parts revenues of million and million  respectively 
increases in monitor revenues reflect new contracts with boeing co  lockheed martin  and others  which began in fiscal specifically  display systems and aydin displays posted increases of million and million  respectively  compared to fiscal there were offsetting declines of million at lexel during the year due to the fact that lexel completed one of its major contracts during fiscal lexel s other product lines  however  maintained backlogs of million at february  increases in data display revenues are attributed primarily to management s decision in late fiscal to distribute commercial and military projection tube displays from its data display location in tucker  georgia 
these projection tube displays carry a higher price per unit than its normal inventory 
within the entertainment division  sales declined million compared to fiscal there were declines of million at the novatron location  which is a result of management s decision in late fiscal to distribute projection tube displays from its data display location  which is a part of the data display division 
the magnaview location showed decreases of million compared to last fiscal year 
management closed this location in january and merged its operations with its chroma location in white mills  pa as of february  the chroma location showed decreases of million compared to fiscal  which is a result of weaker demand in the television tube replacement market 
the company is the primary supplier of replacement television crts to the domestic entertainment market 
a majority of the entertainment division s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets to  fewer extended warranties were sold by retailers  a trend consistent with the prior two fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of product to meet manufacturers standard warranties 
growth in this division will be negatively impacted by the decreasing number of extended warranties sold for the larger  more expensive sets 
sales of component parts declined million compared to the fiscal year ended february  sales of these parts declined over the prior two fiscal years due to weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales 
electron gun sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined over the past few years as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
the company s wintron location is in the process of transitioning to two newer camera technologies 
one such technology will assist border guards with under car inspections and another will assist correctional facilities with the supervision of inmates 
if successful  the company believes these new technologies will have a positive impact on the component division sales 
within the wholesale parts segments  sales were positively impacted by the addition of a new call center in fiscal this call center added approximately million in new sales for the fiscal year  which was offset by declines in other areas of that segment s business of million 
gross margins consolidated gross profit margins remained unchanged at for the year ended february  as compared to the fiscal year ended february  display margins decreased slightly to from and the wholesale electronic parts margins remained relatively unchanged at for the year ended february  as compared to at february  within the display segment  data display gross margins decreased from for the fiscal year ended february  to for the fiscal year ended february  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management decided to increase its reserve for inventory obsolescence within this division 
excluding the effects of this adjustment  gross margins for data display would ve been for the year ended february   which reflects the positive impact of management s decision to distribute higher margin projection tubes from its data display location in tucker  ga 
gross margins in home entertainment crts decreased from at february  to at february  this reflects lower sales volume for the comparable periods 
revenues decreased million for the comparable periods 
in monitors projectors  gross margins increased from to for the comparable periods 
this increase is attributable to increases in revenues of million 
revenues increased without a corresponding increase in costs by improving production efficiency as fixed costs were absorbed by greater production 
gross margins from component parts sold decreased from to for the comparable periods 
this decrease was due to decreases in sales within this division of million for the comparable periods 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of sales remained flat at approximately for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  display segment operating expenses increased million  while operating expenses for the consumer parts distribution segment increased million 
within the display segment  most of this increase was posted within the monitor operations as increased growth has required additional administrative support 
the company s cape canaveral operations added people during the fiscal year ended february  within the consumer parts distribution segment  these increases reflect additional labor and overhead associated with its new call center that was opened in fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased  for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
libor and prime rates were slightly lower during the comparable periods

the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be currently manufactured

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount 
management attempts to determine by historical usage analysis and interchangeability of crt types along with repair contracts currently maintained by its customers  as well as numerous other market factors  the projected demand for crts in this estimate of net realizable value 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
such reviews include observations of product development trends of the oem s  new products being marketed and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the company s existing inventories 
there have been no significant changes in management s estimates in fiscal and  however  the company cannot guarantee the accuracy of future forecasts since these estimates are subject to change based on market conditions 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company deducted inventory against the reserve for obsolescence in the amount of million  million and million  respectively 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million and million at february  and february   respectively 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized on the sale of products when the products are shipped  all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs incurred for the delivery of product to customers are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated statements of operations 
a portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture crts to a buyers specification 
these contracts are accounted for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
these contracts are fixed price and cost plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the wholesale parts segment has several distribution agreements that it accounts for using the gross revenue basis as prescribed by eitf issue the company uses the gross method because the company has general inventory risk  physical loss inventory risk and credit risk 
the call center service revenue is recognized based on written pricing agreements with each manufacturer  on a per call  per email or per standard mail basis 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts is determined by reviewing all accounts receivable and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors as well as past payment history and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
historically  the company s allowance has been sufficient for any customer write offs 
although the company cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 
warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a general reserve based on historical claims experience 
the company considers actual warranty claims compared to net sales  then adjusts its reserve liability accordingly 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
management feels that historically its procedures have been adequate and does not anticipate that its assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future 
other accounting policies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties
