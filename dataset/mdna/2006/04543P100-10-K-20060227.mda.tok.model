com are to the nilson report  issue  dated july  and issue  dated june company overview we have been purchasing and collecting defaulted or charged off accounts receivable portfolios from consumer credit originators since the formation of our predecessor company in charged off receivables are the unpaid obligations of individuals to credit originators  such as credit card issuers  consumer finance companies  retail merchants  telecommunications and utility providers 
since these receivables are delinquent or past due  we are able to purchase them at a substantial discount 
we purchase and collect charged off consumer receivable portfolios for our own account as we believe this affords us the best opportunity to use long term strategies to maximize our profits 
we currently do not collect on a commission or contingent fee basis 
the growth rate of cash collections for the three month and twelve month periods ending december  slowed to and  respectively from and for the three month and twelve month periods ending december   respectively 
the primary factor contributing to the slowdown in collection growth is the pace of purchase growth at face value  which has been relatively flat for the years through due to our disciplined approach to purchasing charged off receivables 
additional contributors toward slowing growth include high turnover among our account representative professionals and lower than expected results on some non traditional purchases  specifically wireless telecommunications 
high turnover has negatively impacted collections as there is a positive correlation between account representative experience and productivity 
wireless telecommunications purchases accounted for of purchases at face value and are not performing up to initial expectations 
we addressed turnover during the fourth quarter and have seen improvement over third quarter turnover rates 
as a result of the slower than expected collections on our purchased receivable portfolios  during the fourth quarter of we recorded net impairments of million 
the net impairment charge reduced revenue and the carrying value of the purchased receivables 
the majority of the fourth quarter purchase impairments are attributable to purchases of wireless telecommunications debt 
utilizing the data collected and experience gained on these purchases  we have adjusted our purchasing models and have become increasingly thorough in our due diligence of non traditional asset classes 
in an effort to stimulate collections during the year  we expanded our collection efforts and increased the amount spent for certain collection expenses  specifically letter expenses and legal expenses 
these expenses increased due to an increase in the number of letter campaigns pursued during the second half of and an increase in the number of accounts for which legal action has been initiated 
we expect to benefit in from the increased legal action initiated during the latter half of during  cash collections increased to million 
revenues for were million  a increase over the prior year 
net income was million for  compared to million for net income in included a million compensation and related payroll charge million on an after tax basis for the vesting of outstanding share appreciation rights and a deferred tax charge of million 
during  we invested million net of buybacks in charged off consumer receivable portfolios  with an aggregate face value of billion  or of face value 
we have seen prices for charged off accounts receivable portfolios increase over the past to months and believe prices to be relatively high at the current time 
we believe that price increases have slowed during  however we cannot give any assurances about future 
table of contents prices either overall or within account or asset types 
we are determined to remain disciplined and purchase portfolios only when we believe we can achieve acceptable returns 
we regularly utilize unaffiliated third parties  primarily attorneys and other collection agencies  to collect certain account balances on our behalf 
the percent of gross collections from such third parties has increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to increased legal activity in states that we are not located  as well as a slight increase in the use of third party collection agencies 
on april   we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
all of these shares were sold by selling stockholders  which include members of management and other holders  and none of the shares were sold by us 
the selling stockholders received all of the net proceeds from the sale of the shares 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement between the company and certain of the selling stockholders  the company paid approximately  related to the secondary offering 
in addition  the selling stockholders collectively  retain the right to request three additional registrations of specified shares  under the registration rights agreement  in which case we will be required to bear such offering expenses in the quarter in which any future offering occurs 
industry overview the accounts receivable management industry is growing  driven by a number of industry trends  including increasing levels of consumer debt obligations according to the us federal reserve board  the consumer credit industry increased from billion of consumer debt obligations in to trillion of consumer debt obligations in november  a compound annual growth rate of 
the nilson report projects that this market will increase to trillion by increasing charge offs of the underlying receivables according to the nilson report  net charge offs of credit card debt have increased from billion in to billion in  a compound annual growth rate of 
the nilson report is forecasting an increase in the net charge offs of credit card debt to billion in increasing types of credit originators accessing the debt sale market according to the nilson report  the cost for all types of purchased debt sold has increased from billion in to billion in  a compound annual growth rate of 
sellers of charged off portfolios have expanded to include healthcare  utility and telecommunications providers  commercial banks  consumer finance companies  retail merchants and mortgage and auto finance companies 
historically  credit originators have sought to limit credit losses either through using internal collection efforts with their own personnel or outsourcing collection activities to third party collectors 
credit originators that outsource the collection of charged off receivables have typically remained committed to third party providers as a result of the perceived economic benefit of outsourcing and the resources required to establish the infrastructure required to support in house collection efforts 
the credit originator can pursue an outsourced solution by either selling its charged off receivables for immediate cash proceeds or by placing charged off receivables with a third party collector on a contingent fee basis while retaining ownership of the receivables 
in the event that a credit originator sells receivables to a debt purchaser such as us  the credit originator receives immediate cash proceeds and eliminates the costs and risks associated with internal recovery operations 
the purchase price for these charged off receivables are usually discounted to from their face values  depending on the amount the purchaser anticipates it can recover and the anticipated effort required to recover that amount 
credit originators  as well as other holders of consumer debt  utilize a variety of processes to sell receivables  including the following competitive bids for specified portfolios through a sealed bid or  in some cases  an on line process  privately negotiated transactions between the credit originator or other holder of consumer debt and a purchaser  and 
table of contents forward flow contracts  which commit a debt seller to sell  and a purchaser to acquire  a steady flow of charged off consumer receivables periodically over a specified period of time  usually no less than three months  for a fixed percentage of the face value of the receivables 
we believe a debt purchaser s ability to successfully collect payments on charged off receivables  despite previous collection efforts by the credit originator or third party collection agencies  is driven by several factors  including the purchaser s ability to pursue collections over multi year periods  tailor repayment plans based on a consumer s ability to pay  and utilize experience and resources  including litigation 
history and reorganization lee acceptance company was formed in by rufus h 
reitzel  jr 
as a sole proprietorship for the purpose of purchasing and collecting charged off consumer receivables

table of contents seasonality our business depends on our ability to collect on our purchased portfolios of charged off consumer receivables 
collections within portfolios tend to be seasonally higher in the first and second quarters of the year due to consumers receipt of tax refunds and other factors 
conversely  collections within portfolios tend to be lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to consumers spending in connection with summer vacations  the holiday season and other factors 
our historical growth in purchased portfolios and in our resultant quarterly cash collections has helped to minimize the effect of seasonal cash collections 
operating expenses are seasonally higher during the first and second quarters of the year due to expenses necessary to process the increase in cash collections 
however  revenue recognized is relatively level due to the application of the interest method for revenue recognition 
in addition  our operating results may be affected to a lesser extent by the timing of purchases of charged off consumer receivables due to the initial costs associated with purchasing and integrating these receivables into our system 
consequently  income and margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter

critical accounting policies we utilize the interest method of accounting for our purchased receivables because we believe that the amounts and timing of cash collections for our purchased receivables can be reasonably estimated 
this belief is predicated on our historical results and our knowledge of the industry 
the interest method is prescribed by the accounting standards executive committee practice bulletin pb  amortization of discounts on certain acquired loans as well as the accounting standards executive committee statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the provisions of sop were adopted by us in january and apply to purchased receivables acquired after december  the provisions of sop that relate to decreases in expected cash flows amend pb for 
table of contents consistent treatment and apply prospectively to receivables acquired before january  purchased receivables acquired before january  will continue to be accounted for under pb  as amended  for provisions related to decreases in expected cash flows 
each static pool of receivables is statistically modeled to determine its projected cash flows based on historical cash collections for pools with similar characteristics 
an internal rate of return irr is calculated for each static pool of receivables based on the projected cash flows 
the irr is applied to the remaining balance of each static pool of accounts to determine the revenue recognized 
each static pool is analyzed at least quarterly to assess the actual performance compared to the expected performance 
to the extent there are differences in actual performance versus expected performance  the irr is adjusted prospectively to reflect the revised estimate of cash flows over the remaining life of the static pool 
effective january  under sop  if the revised cash flow estimates are less than the original estimates  the irr remains unchanged and an impairment is recognized 
if cash flow estimates increase subsequent to recording an impairment  reversal of the previously recognized impairment is made prior to any increases to the irr 
application of the interest method of accounting requires the use of estimates to calculate a projected irr for each pool 
these estimates are based on historical cash collections 
if future cash collections are materially different in amount or timing than projected cash collections  earnings could be affected  either positively or negatively 
higher collection amounts or cash collections that occur sooner than projected cash collections will have a favorable impact on reversal of impairments  yields and revenues 
lower collection amounts or cash collections that occur later than projected cash collections will have an unfavorable impact and result in an impairment being recorded

assuming a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt  interest expense would have increased approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively
