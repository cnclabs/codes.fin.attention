products  services and strategies chlor alkali products products and services we have been involved in the us chlor alkali industry for more than years and are a major participant in the us chlor alkali market 
chlorine and caustic soda are co produced commercially primarily by the electrolysis of salt 
these co products are produced simultaneously  and in a fixed ratio of ton of chlorine to tons of caustic soda 
the industry refers to this as an electrochemical unit or ecu 
with a demonstrated capacity as of the end of of million ecus per year  including of the production from our partnership with polyone corporation  which we refer to as our sunbelt joint venture  we are the fourth largest chlor alkali producer in the united states  according to data from chemical market associates  inc cmai 
cmai is a global petrochemical  plastics and fibers consulting firm established in according to cmai data  we are the largest producer measured by production volume of chlorine and caustic soda in the eastern united states  with facilities located in mcintosh  al  charleston  tn  augusta  ga  and niagara falls  ny 
since transportation costs can be a significant part of the final cost of the product to the customer  our close proximity to our caustic customers is an advantage 
approximately two thirds of our caustic soda production is high purity membrane and rayon grade  which according to cmai data  normally commands a premium selling price in the market 
our manufacturing facilities in augusta  mcintosh  charleston  and a portion of our facility in niagara falls are iso certified 
iso which includes iso and iso and iso which includes iso are sets of related international standards on quality assurance and environmental management developed by the international organization for standardization to help companies effectively document the quality and environmental management system elements to be implemented to maintain effective quality and environmental management systems 
all four of these manufacturing facilities have also achieved star status in the voluntary protection program vpp of the occupational safety and health administration osha 
osha s vpp is a program in which companies voluntarily participate that recognizes facilities for their exemplary safety and health programs 
in  chlor alkali sought accreditation at its headquarters location and two of its operating plants niagara falls and charleston under the rc responsible care standard 
official registry board accreditation for all three sites was received by january  rc  which includes the iso environmental standard  is a comprehensive integrated management system sanctioned by the chemical industry and recognized by government and regulatory agencies which establishes requirements for the management of the safety  health  environmental  security  transportation  product stewardship  and stakeholder engagement activities of the business 
accreditation at the two remaining operating facilities augusta and mcintosh is scheduled to be completed in chlorine is used as a raw material in the production of thousands of products  but a significant portion of us chlorine production is consumed in the manufacture of ethylene dichloride  or edc  a precursor for polyvinyl chloride  or pvc 
pvc is a plastic used in applications such as vinyl siding  plumbing and automotive parts 
other us end uses for chlorine include chlorinated intermediates  isocyanates and water treatment 
while much of the chlorine produced in the us is consumed by the producing company to make downstream products  we sell most of the chlorine we produce to third parties in the merchant market 
caustic soda has a wide variety of end use applications  the largest of which is in the pulp and paper industry 
caustic soda is also used in the production of detergents and soaps  alumina and a variety of other inorganic and organic chemicals 
the chlor alkali industry is cyclical  both as a result of changes in demand for each of the co products and as a result of the large increments in which new capacity is added 
because chlorine and caustic are produced in a fixed ratio  the supply of one product can be constrained both by the physical capacity of the production facilities and or by the ability to sell the co product 
prices for both products respond rapidly to changes in supply and demand 
our ecu netbacks defined as gross selling price less freight and discounts averaged approximately per ecu in the first half of and then increased quarter over quarter through  with fourth quarter netbacks averaging approximately per ecu 
electricity and salt are the major purchased raw materials for our chlor alkali products segment 
raw materials represent approximately of the total cost of producing an ecu 
electricity is the single largest raw material component in the production of chlor alkali products 
during the past two years  we experienced an increase in the cost of electricity from our suppliers due to price increases in natural gas and coal 
we are supplied by utilities that primarily utilize coal  hydroelectric and nuclear power and have relatively minor exposure to natural gas 
the majority of the salt used in our chlor alkali products segment is produced from internal resources but we do purchase salt in the merchant market 
the commodity nature of this industry places an added emphasis on cost management and we believe that we have managed our manufacturing costs in a manner that makes us one of the low cost producers in the industry 
in addition  as market demand grows in the future  we believe the design of the sunbelt joint venture plant will enable us to expand capacity cost effectively 
we also manufacture and sell other chlor alkali related products and we recently invested in capacity and product upgrades in some of these areas 
these products include chemically processed salt  hydrochloric acid  sodium hypochlorite  hydrogen  and potassium hydroxide 
we also sell sodium hydrosulfite to paper  textile and clay bleaching customers

based on our market research  we believe our chlor alkali products business is viewed as a preferred supplier by our merchant market customers 
we will continue to focus on providing quality customer service support and developing relationships with our valued customers 
pursue incremental expansion opportunities 
we have invested in capacity and product upgrades in our chemically processed salt  hydrochloric acid  sodium hypochlorite  potassium hydroxide and hydrogen businesses 
these expansions increase our captive use of chlorine while increasing the sales of these co products 
these niche businesses provide opportunities to upgrade chlorine and caustic to higher value added applications 
we also have the opportunity  when business conditions permit  to pursue incremental expansion through our sunbelt joint venture 
metals products and services we have been in the metals business for years 
based on copper development association inc cda data  we are a leading manufacturer of copper and copper alloy sheet  strip  plate  foil and brass rod in the united states 
cda acts as the central authoritative source of data and information pertaining to the us copper and brass industry 
while primarily processing copper and copper alloys  we also reroll and form other metals  such as aluminum and stainless steel 
we believe we hold leading positions for premium priced  high performance alloys in the united states 
we also supply high performance alloys to non us customers through exports  technology licensing  joint ventures and local distribution 
participants in the copper and copper alloy sheet and strip industry include integrated mills  reroll mills and distributors  with many participants engaging in multiple roles 
we believe that we are the largest us participant in each of these categories 
we believe that our status as the largest us participant affords us a favorable industry position 
we also believe we are one of the lowest cost producers  a quality and service leader and a specialty product innovator 
all of our copper and copper alloy sheet and strip mills are both qs and iso certified 
qs is an international automotive standard developed by general motors  ford motor company and chrysler to harmonize the fundamental supplier quality systems as an assessment tool  and is based upon iso standards 
all sheet and strip and rod locations are iso certified 
our brass rod mill is iso certified 
we maintain advantages over our competition through our patent protected technologies 
we believe our high performance alloys provide superior strength  conductivity and formability to customers in the automotive  electrical  electronic and telecommunications industries 
we currently hold us patents associated with high performance alloys and other us patents related to various proprietary processing and technical capabilities  many of which are also registered in foreign jurisdictions 
to further our global presence  we established a joint venture with yamaha corporation in japan to produce high performance alloys  formed a technical alliance with wieland werke ag of germany under which we jointly develop new high performance alloys and participate in an alloy licensing arrangement and formed a joint venture with luoyang copper group ltd 
in china to operate a metals service center to supply the growing chinese demand 
these relationships provide us with greater global reach and enable us to provide high performance alloys in asia and europe 
in addition  through sales of our clad metal  produced by a proprietary cladding process  we believe we are a major supplier of coinage metal to the us mint 
we also supply coinage metal to other world governments 
our metals segment produces ammunition cartridge cups for use captively in the manufacture of our winchester sporting ammunition  which constitutes a small portion of our total metals segment output 
we also sell cartridge brass to other ammunition makers 
this relationship with winchester  along with our fabrication business  provides us with a significant captive customer base 
brass and other copper alloys are manufactured by melting copper together with various combinations of zinc  lead or other metals 
the resulting product goes through a series of processes  including casting  hot rolling  milling  cold rolling  annealing  cleaning and slitting to produce sheet and strip 
a similar process is followed for the production of rod 
the principal end uses for sheet and strip products include automotive connectors and radiators  electronics lead frames  connectors  wiring and telecommunications applications  ammunition  coinage  and other applications such as builder s hardware  plumbing supplies and welded tube for utility condensers and industrial heat exchangers 
brass rod is used to produce a variety of products  such as faucets  plumbing fittings  heating and air conditioning components  industrial valves  automotive parts and numerous hardware components 
the major raw materials used in our metals business are brass scrap  copper  zinc  and other non ferrous metals  purchased from merchants  dealers  and customers at market prices 
historically  demand for copper and copper alloy sheet and strip and rod has exhibited growth consistent with the growth in the us gross domestic product 
in the late s and in  demand expanded at a rapid pace principally due to the strength in the electronics segment and the introduction of the state quarter program by the us mint 
from to  sheet and strip demand grew at an annualized growth rate of 
since  strip and rod demand has been unchanged at levels approximately and  respectively  below that of the late s

yamaha olin metal corporation  of which we are a owner  manufactures high performance copper alloys in japan for sale to the electronics industry throughout the far east 
our subsidiary  olin australia limited  loads and packs sporting and industrial ammunition in australia 
we entered into an agreement with luoyang copper group ltd 
to jointly construct and operate a metals service center in guangzhou  china  which became operational in the first quarter of see the note segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  for geographic segment data 
we are incorporating our segment information from that note into this section of our form k 
customers and distribution during  no single customer accounted for more than of consolidated sales 
sales to all us government agencies and sales under us government contracting activities in total accounted for approximately of consolidated sales in products we sell to industrial or commercial users or distributors for use in the production of other products constitute a major part of our total sales 
we sell some of our products  such as caustic soda  sporting ammunition  and metals products  to a large number of users or distributors  while we sell others  such as chlorine  in substantial quantities to a relatively small number of industrial users 
we discuss the customers for each of our three businesses in more detail above under products and services 
we market most of our products and services primarily through our sales force and sell directly to various industrial customers  the us government and its prime contractors  to wholesalers and other distributors 
because we engage in some government contracting activities and make sales to the us government  we are subject to extensive and complex us government procurement laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations provide for ongoing government audits and reviews of contract procurement  performance and administration 
failure to comply  even inadvertently  with these laws and regulations and with laws governing the export of munitions and other controlled products and commodities could subject us or one or more of our businesses to civil and criminal penalties  and under certain circumstances  suspension and debarment from future government contracts and the exporting of products for a specified period of time 
competition we are in active competition with businesses producing the same or similar products  as well as  in some instances  with businesses producing different products designed for the same uses 
we are among the largest manufacturers or distributors in the united states of ammunition  copper based strip  rod  and certain chlor alkali products based on data provided by the sporting arms and ammunition manufacturers institute saami  cda and cmai  respectively 
founded in  saami is an association of the nation s leading manufacturers of sporting firearms  ammunition and components 
many factors influence our ability to compete successfully  including price  delivery  service  performance  product innovation and product recognition and quality  depending on the product involved 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees  with  working in the united states and working in foreign countries 
various labor unions represent a majority of our hourly paid employees for collective bargaining purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  we reached a three year agreement with all five labor unions representing approximately  employees at our east alton facility where both metals and winchester are headquartered

research activities  patents our research activities are conducted on a product group basis at a number of facilities 
company sponsored research expenditures were million in  million in  and million in we own or license a number of patents  patent applications and trade secrets covering our products and processes  particularly for use in our metals segment 
we believe that  in the aggregate  the rights under our patents and licenses are important to our operations  but we do not consider any individual patent or license or group of patents and licenses related to a specific process or product to be of material importance to our total business 
raw materials and energy we purchase the major portion of our raw material requirements 
the principal basic raw materials for our production of chlor alkali products are salt  electricity  sulfur dioxide  and hydrogen 
the majority of the salt used in our chlor alkali products segment is produced from internal resources 
copper  zinc  various other nonferrous metals and brass scrap are required for the metals business 
lead  brass  and propellant are the principal raw materials used in the winchester business 
we typically purchase our electricity  salt  sulfur dioxide  and propellants pursuant to multi year contracts 
in the manufacture of ammunition  we use a substantial percentage of our own output of cartridge brass 
we provide additional information with respect to specific raw materials in the tables above under products and services 
electricity is the predominant energy source for our manufacturing facilities 
most of our facilities are served by utilities which generate electricity principally from coal  hydroelectric and nuclear power 
environmental and toxic substances controls the establishment and implementation of federal  state and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality have affected and will continue to affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase operating costs 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites and we are a party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities 
charges or credits to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in the past three years and may be material to net income in future years

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating olin and our business 
all of our forward looking statements should be considered in light of these factors 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us 
sensitivity to global economic conditions and cyclicality our operating results could be negatively affected during economic downturns 
the business of most of our customers  particularly our vinyl  urethanes  pulp and paper  automotive  coinage  electrical connectors  telecommunications and housing customers  are  to varying degrees  cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns 
these economic and industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and  in some cases  lower average selling prices 
therefore  any significant downturn in our customers businesses or in global economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of the depressed economic conditions beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing through the first half of  our vinyls  urethanes and pulp and paper customers had lower demand for our chlor alkali products 
during the period  demand for chlor alkali products was low enough to lead to plant shutdowns within the industry and about of capacity was removed from north american production 
when demand improved in early  the operating rates increased to the mid to high range  resulting in a tight supply demand balance which has resulted in increasing pricing 
we believe no new significant capacity is anticipated to come on stream until late or early  and as a result  we believe supply demand is expected to remain relatively tight and pricing is expected to remain above historical levels 
lower demand in our metals segment has adversely affected our business and results of operations since the rod industry has been negatively affected by customers migration to lower cost  offshore locations and by continued reductions in capital spending in the industrial machinery segment and reduced demand for building and household products as a result of declines in commercial construction 
in  metals us demand was down approximately from metals demand in the automotive and building products segments were down in  while ammunition  coinage  and electronics market segment shipments all experienced increases over although we do not generally sell a large percentage of our products directly to customers abroad  a large part of our financial performance is dependent upon a healthy economy beyond the united states 
our customers sell their products abroad 
as a result  our business is affected by general economic conditions and other factors in western europe and most of east asia  particularly china and japan  including fluctuations in interest rates  customer demand  labor costs and other factors beyond our control 
the demand for our customers products  and therefore  our products  is directly affected by such fluctuations 
we cannot assure you that events having an adverse effect on the industries in which we operate will not occur or continue  such as a further downturn in the western european  asian or world economies  increases in interest rates  unfavorable currency fluctuations or a prolonged slowdown in the coinage  electronic or telecommunications industries 
the terrorist attacks of september th created many economic and political uncertainties and have had a negative impact on the global economy 
the long term effects of these attacks on our future operating results and financial condition are unknown 
the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and the potential for additional terrorist attacks or similar events could have further material adverse effects on the economy in general  on our industry and on our operations 
for example  war with one or more countries could have numerous consequences for us and our customers  one of which may be sustained high energy prices 
cyclical pricing pressure our profitability could be reduced by declines in average selling prices of our products  particularly declines in the ecu netback for chlorine and caustic 
our historical operating results reflect the cyclical and sometimes volatile nature of the chemical  metals and ammunition industries 
we experience cycles of fluctuating supply and demand in each of our business segments  particularly in chlor alkali products  which results in changes in selling prices 
periods of high demand  tight supply and increasing operating margins tend to result in increased capacity and production until supply exceeds demand  generally followed by periods of oversupply and declining prices 
the industry build cycle  and its impact on industry pricing  has been most pronounced in our chlor alkali products segment 
for example  in and  the chlor alkali industry was very profitable due to a tight supply demand balance  which resulted in both higher operating rates and higher ecu prices 
higher profits led to reinvestment to expand capacity 
this new capacity became operational in and  resulting in industry over capacity 
this imbalance was exacerbated by falling demand as a result of the asian financial crisis 
the supply demand imbalance resulted in both lower operating rates and lower ecu prices  and in  many chlor alkali producers had operating losses 
the supply demand balance improved due to improved economic conditions in compared to  and ecu prices increased in compared to as the us and world economies deteriorated in and through the first half of  the chlor alkali industry again experienced a period of oversupply because of lower industry demand for both chlorine and caustic 
during the timeframe about of north american production was shut down which caused operating rates to improve without much improvement in demand 
in late and early  chlorine demand began to strengthen and operating rates increased to the mid to high range 
caustic demand began to strengthen by mid year and supplies of both products have been tight since that time 
this has resulted in price increase initiatives over the last months 
we believe that with supply and demand in balance  and no new capacity anticipated to be available in the next couple of years  may be the cycle peak for the chlor alkali industry 
another factor impacting demand for chlorine and caustic soda is the price of natural gas 
higher natural gas prices  which through have exceeded per million british thermal units  increase our customers manufacturing costs  and depending on the crude oil to gas ratio  could make them less competitive in world markets and  therefore  may result in reduced demand for our products 
price in the chlor alkali industry is a major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large commodity market 
decreases in the average selling prices of our products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant and internal consumption remains approximately the same  a per ecu selling price change equates to an approximate million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit when we are operating at full capacity 
while we strive to maintain or increase our profitability by reducing costs through improving production efficiency  emphasizing higher margin products  and by controlling transportation  selling  and administration expenses  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be sufficient to offset fully the effect of changes in pricing on operating results 
because of the cyclical nature of our businesses  we cannot assure you that pricing or profitability in the future will be comparable to any particular historical period  including the most recent period shown in our operating results 
we cannot assure you that the chlor alkali industry will not experience adverse trends in the future  or that our operating results and or financial condition will not be adversely affected by them 
our metals and winchester segments are also subject to changes in operating results as a result of cyclical pricing pressures  but to a lesser extent than the chlor alkali products segment 
we generally pass changes in prices for copper and other metals along to our customers as part of the negotiated price of the finished product in most of our metals segment product lines 
however  our metals segment experiences pricing pressure with respect to its conversion charges  and we cannot assure you that adverse trends in pricing and margins will not affect operating results in the future 
changes in global supply demand for copper and copper alloys may affect our ability to obtain raw materials under reasonable terms and conditions which may materially adversely affect our operating results 
similarly  selling prices of ammunition are affected by changes in raw material costs and availability and customer demand  and declines in average selling prices of our winchester segment could adversely affect our profitability 
imbalance in demand for our chlor alkali products a loss of a substantial customer for our chlorine or caustic soda could cause an imbalance in demand for these products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
chlorine and caustic soda are produced simultaneously and in a fixed ratio of ton of chlorine to tons of caustic soda 
the loss of a substantial chlorine or caustic soda customer could cause an imbalance in demand for our chlorine and caustic soda products 
an imbalance in demand may require us to reduce production of both chlorine and caustic soda or take other steps to correct the imbalance 
since we cannot store chlorine  we may not be able to respond to an imbalance in demand for these products as quickly or efficiently as some of our competitors 
if a substantial imbalance occurred  we would need to reduce prices or take other actions that could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
pension plans the impact of declines in global equity markets on asset values and any declines in interest rates used to value the liabilities in our pension plan may result in higher pension costs and the need to fund the pension plan in future years in material amounts 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  we recorded non cash after tax charges of million million pretax and million million pretax to shareholders equity as of december  and december   respectively 
these charges reflect an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the year end market value of assets of our pension plan 
in  the cost impact of plan changes and the adverse effect of lower interest rates more than offset the increase in the value of plan assets and in  the adverse impact of lower interest rates more than offset the increase in plan assets  which necessitated the recording of these after tax charges to shareholders equity 
these are non cash charges and do not affect our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement 
the determinations of pension expense and pension funding are based on a variety of rules and regulations 
changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets 
they may also result in higher pension costs  additional financial statement disclosure  and accelerate and increase the need to fund the pension plan 
there are currently a number of legislative proposals being considered  that if enacted  would change the current rules 
most of these proposals would accelerate the pension funding compared to funding under the existing rules 
in addition  the impact of declines in global equity and bond markets on asset values may result in higher pension costs and may increase and accelerate the need to fund the pension in future years 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a one hundred basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased  respectively  the pension cost by approximately million 
holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease or increase in the discount rate used to calculate pension costs for would have increased or decreased pension costs by million and million  respectively 
the same basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have increased or decreased the accumulated benefit obligation by million 
environmental costs we have ongoing environmental costs  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
the nature of our operations and products  including the raw materials we handle  exposes us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental matters 
we have incurred  and expect to incur  significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations 
the ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict 
liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
one liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site  regardless of fault  percentage of contribution to the site or the legality of the original disposal 
we could incur significant costs  including cleanup costs  natural resources damages  civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third party lawsuits claiming  for example  personal injury and or property damage  as a result of past or future violations of  or liabilities under  environmental or other laws 
in addition  future events  such as changes to or more rigorous enforcement of environmental laws  could require us to make additional expenditures  modify or curtail our operations and or install pollution control equipment 
accordingly  it is possible that some of the matters in which we are involved or may become involved may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
competition we face competition from other chemical  metals and ammunition companies  including the migration by united states customers to low cost foreign locations  which could adversely affect our revenues and financial condition 
we are in active competition with companies producing the same or similar products  as well as  in some instances  with companies producing different products designed for the same uses 
with respect to certain product groups  such as ammunition  copper alloys and brass rod  and with respect to certain chlor alkali products  we are among the largest manufacturers or distributors in the united states 
we encounter competition in price  delivery  service  securing and maintaining customers  performance  technology  product innovation  and product recognition and quality  depending on the product involved 
our customers could decide to move some or all of their production to lower cost  offshore locations and this could reduce demand in the united states for our products 
with respect to certain products  some of our competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have less debt than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the industries in which we operate and throughout the economy as a whole 
if we do not compete successfully  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
cost control our profitability could be reduced if we experience higher than expected raw material  utility  transportation or logistics costs  or if we fail to achieve our targeted cost reductions 
our operating results and profitability are dependent upon our continued ability to control  and in some cases further reduce  our costs 
if we are unable to do so  or if costs outside of our control  particularly our costs of raw materials  utilities  transportation and similar costs  increase beyond anticipated levels  our profitability will decline 
production hazards our facilities are subject to operating hazards  which may disrupt our business 
we are dependent upon the continued safe operation of our production facilities 
our production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacture  handling  storage and transportation of chemical materials and products and ammunition  including leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  unexpected utility disruptions or outages  unscheduled downtime and environmental hazards 
from time to time in the past  we have had incidents that have temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupted our manufacturing  causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and fatalities 
some of our products involve the manufacture and or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials 
use of these products by our customers could also result in liability if an explosion  fire  spill or other accident were to occur 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience these types of incidents in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
litigation and claims we are subject to litigation and other claims  which could cause us to incur significant expenses 
we are a defendant in a number of pending legal proceedings relating to our present and former operations 
these include proceedings alleging injurious exposure of plaintiffs to various chemicals and other substances including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos 
frequently  such proceedings involve claims made by numerous plaintiffs against many defendants 
we believe we have valid defenses to these proceedings and are defending them vigorously 
however  because of the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings and therefore cannot determine whether the financial impact  if any  will be material to our financial position or results of operations 
indebtedness our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to grow and compete  which could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 
as of december   we had million of indebtedness outstanding  including million representing the fair value related to million of interest rate swaps in effect at december  and excluding our guarantee of million of indebtedness of our sunbelt joint venture 
this does not include our million senior credit facility on which we had million available on that date because we had issued million of letters of credit 
as of december   our indebtedness represented of our total capitalization 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to grow and compete  which in turn could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 
despite our level of indebtedness  the terms of our senior credit facility and our existing indentures permit us to borrow additional money 
if we borrow more money  the risks related to our indebtedness could increase significantly 
debt service we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt  which may require us to refinance our indebtedness or default on our scheduled debt payments 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations 
if we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  sell assets or raise equity 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had interest rate swaps of million  which convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
as a result  of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to short term interest rates 
if interest rates rise  our costs relative to those obligations would also rise 
tax audits we are currently subject to ongoing tax audits  which may result in additional tax payments 
during  the internal revenue service irs substantially completed its audit of our federal income tax return for the years and we are currently contesting various issues before the appeals division of the irs with respect to the years through depending on the outcome of these audits  we may be required to pay additional taxes  and any additional taxes and related interest could be substantial 
we have reserved amounts which we believe will be sufficient for any adverse outcome 
the timing of any such payments is uncertain 
labor matters we cannot assure you that we can conclude future labor contracts or any other labor agreements without work stoppages 
various labor unions represent a majority of our hourly paid employees for collective bargaining purposes 
a description of the labor contracts that are due to expire in the near future are listed below location number of employees expiration date niagara falls  ny chlor alkali july bryan  oh metals september seymour  ct metals november queretaro  mexico metals february while we believe our relations with our employees and their various representatives are generally satisfactory  we cannot assure that we can conclude future labor contracts or any other labor agreements without work stoppages and cannot assure that any work stoppages will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
security and chemicals transportation new regulations on the transportation of hazardous chemicals and or the security of chemical manufacturing facilities and public policy changes related to transportation safety could result in significantly higher operating costs 
the chemical industry  including the chlor alkali industry  has proactively responded to the issues surrounding the events of september  by starting new initiatives relating to the security of chemicals industry facilities and the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
simultaneously  government at the local  state  and federal levels has begun the regulatory process which could lead to new regulations that would impact the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals 
our chlor alkali business could be adversely impacted because of an incident at one of our facilities or an incident while transporting product or the cost of complying with new regulations 
the extent of the impact would depend on the consequences of an incident and the nature and direction of future regulations  which are unknown at this time 
changes in laws and regulations we are subject to a variety of existing laws and regulations that affect our business 
we are unable to determine what effect  if any  the impact of changes in existing or new laws and regulations and the associated compliance costs may have on our operating results

item legal proceedings a we have completed all work in connection with remediation of mercury contamination at the site of our former mercury cell chlor alkali plant in saltville  va required to date 
in mid  the trustees for natural resources in the north fork holston river  the main stem holston river  and associated floodplains  located in smyth and washington counties in virginia and in sullivan and hawkins counties in tennessee notified us of  and invited our participation in  an assessment of alleged injuries to natural resources resulting from the release of mercury 
the trustees also notified us that they have made a preliminary determination that we are potentially liable for natural resource damages in said rivers and floodplains 
we have agreed to participate in the assessment 
in light of the early stage  and inherent uncertainties  of the assessment  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of this matter will be material to our financial position or results of operations 
see environmental matters contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
b as part of the continuing environmental investigation by federal  state and local governments of waste disposal sites  we have entered into a number of settlement agreements requiring us to participate in the investigation and cleanup of a number of sites 
under the terms of such settlements and related agreements  we may be required to manage or perform one or more elements of a site cleanup  or to manage the entire remediation activity for a number of parties  and subsequently seek recovery of some or all of such costs from other potentially responsible parties prps 
in many cases  we do not know the ultimate costs of our settlement obligations at the time of entering into particular settlement agreements  and our liability accruals for our obligations under those agreements are often subject to significant management judgment on an ongoing basis 
those cost accruals are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and our accounting policies set forth in the environmental matters section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
c we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various other legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially impact our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of the litigation concerning alleged exposures  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations 
we have been named as defendant in a number of similar legal actions now pending in federal court in san jose  ca relating to alleged groundwater contamination arising from perchlorate use between and by olin and another unrelated defendant at an olin facility in morgan hill  ca 
we have settled with virtually all of the plaintiffs in these legal actions and continue working with california state regulatory authorities to determine the scope of potential contamination

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business background our manufacturing operations are concentrated in three business segments chlor alkali products  metals  and winchester 
all three are capital intensive manufacturing businesses with growth rates closely tied to the general economy 
each segment has a commodity element to it  and therefore  our ability to influence pricing is quite limited on the portion of the segment s business that is strictly commodity 
our chlor alkali products business is a commodity business where all supplier products are similar and price is the major supplier selection criterion 
we have little or no ability to influence prices in this large  global commodity market 
cyclical price swings  driven by changes in supply demand  can be abrupt and significant and  given capacity in our chlor alkali products business  can lead to very significant changes in our overall profitability 
while a majority of metals sales are of a commodity nature  this business has a significant volume of specialty engineered products targeted for specific end uses 
in these applications  technical capability and performance differentiate the product and play a significant role in product selection and thus price is not the only selection criterion 
winchester also has a commodity element to its business  but a majority of winchester ammunition is sold as a branded consumer product where there are opportunities to differentiate certain offerings through innovative new product development and enhanced product performance 
while competitive pricing versus other branded ammunition products is important  it is not the only factor in product selection 
recent developments and highlights year during  we received a total of million from real estate dispositions  including interest of million 
the first disposition in march represented the settlement of a condemnation award relating to land associated with a former warehousing facility 
the other two transactions represented the disposition of land associated with former manufacturing plants 
during  we recovered environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods and related interest of million from third parties  which relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations 
the first recovery in april was for million 
the second occurred in september and was for million 
the last occurred in november and was for million  which included million in interest 
during the third quarter of  both supply and demand in the chlor alkali industry were interrupted by three hurricanes  which caused customer outages and disruptions to the transportation system 
although none of our facilities were damaged  these factors reduced our operating rate during the third and fourth quarters of on december   we recorded an after tax charge of million million pretax in connection with the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin no 
 an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

fin no 
clarifies when sufficient information is available to estimate an asset retirement obligation 
in conjunction with this adoption  million was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
this charge is principally related to asset retirement obligations for production technology and building materials 
under sfas no 
 we recorded a million after tax charge million pretax to shareholders equity as of december   reflecting an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of the year end market value of assets of our pension plan 
in  the decline in interest rates more than offset a significant rebound in the value of the plan s assets  which necessitated the recording of an additional after tax charge of million million pretax 
on february   we made a voluntary contribution of million to the pension plan with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
in september  we made a second voluntary contribution of million to the pension plan 
these voluntary contributions have improved the funded status of the pension plan 
in addition  the contributions eliminated a pension benefit guaranty corporation variable rate premium of million that would have otherwise become payable from the pension plan assets in in  the decline in interest rates resulted in a basis point reduction more than offset the increases in the value of the plan s assets 
therefore  we recorded in december an additional after tax charge of million million pretax as a result of an increase in the accumulated pension benefit obligation 
in september  we made a voluntary pension plan contribution of million in order to maintain a funded level under the employee retirement income and security act erisa criteria used to determine funding levels 
in  an additional basis point decline in interest rates and the cost impact of contractual pension plan changes more than offset the increase in the value of the plan assets 
therefore  we recorded in december an additional after tax charge of million million pretax as a result of an increase in the accumulated pension benefit obligation 
these non cash charges to shareholders equity in each of the last four years do not affect our ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement 
based on revised assumptions and estimates  no mandatory contributions will be required until we may elect to make selective voluntary contributions  when appropriate  between now and year on january   we announced that our board of directors approved plans to relocate our corporate offices for organizational  strategic and economic reasons 
by the end of the year  we had completed the relocation of a portion of our corporate services personnel from norwalk  ct to our main office building in east alton  il 
we also established our new corporate headquarters in clayton  which is in st 
louis county  mo  for logistical and other reasons 
the relocation of the corporate offices was accompanied by a downsized corporate structure more appropriate for us in today s competitive business environment 
the headquarters relocation was completed by the end of the majority of the corporate personnel have been co located with the brass and winchester businesses resulting in corporate headcount being reduced by approximately forty percent  generating total projected annual savings of approximately million in as a result of the relocation  we incurred costs of million in and incurred an additional million of costs in this restructuring charge included primarily employee severance and related benefit costs  relocation expense  pension curtailment expense and the incurred cost for outplacement services for all affected employees 
the sale of the indianapolis facility in november resulted in a reduction of a previously established reserve related to our indianapolis restructuring of million  which reduced the total restructuring charge to million 
on february   we issued and sold million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net proceeds from the sale were million and were used to make a voluntary contribution of million to our pension plan 
in march  we used million from the proceeds of the stock offering to repay the illinois industrial pollution control revenue bond  which became due in march of the remaining balance million of the proceeds was used in april to pay a portion of federal income taxes related to prior periods 
in  we were accepted to participate in the internal revenue service irs settlement initiative pertaining to tax issues related to our benefits liability management company 
in addition  we settled with the irs relative to our company owned life insurance coli program 
in the third quarter of  a final settlement agreement was reached with the irs on these and certain other outstanding issues related to tax audits covering the through tax years 
in connection with these settlements we made payments in the second quarter of of million 
these payments resolved all open issues regarding our benefits liability management company and our coli program 
these tax issues had been recorded as a liability prior to in the third quarter of  the income tax provision included a million reduction in income tax expense associated with the finalization  in the third quarter of  of the settlement of certain issues related to income tax audits for the years through in may  a fire occurred in the electrical control room for the hot mill located in east alton  il on april  the hot mill was returned to full operation in mid may 
the full year costs relative to the fire were incurred by the metals segment in the second quarter and were million pretax 
in june  we sold our olin aegis business to hcc industries inc olin aegis  headquartered in new bedford  ma  is a manufacturer of high performance  high reliability  hermetic metal packages for the microelectronics industry 
olin aegis employed people 
the sale of our olin aegis business resulted in a pretax gain of million and generated proceeds of million 
for olin aegis  the financial data is classified in our financial statements as discontinued operations for the periods presented prior to on july   we entered into a million five year senior revolving credit facility that replaced the million senior revolving credit facility 
this credit facility expires on july  borrowing options  restrictive covenants and the letter of credit subfacility are similar to or better than those of the million senior revolving credit facility 
in september  we were impacted by equipment problems and a hurricane at our mcintosh  al chlor alkali facility 
we invoked the force majeure clause in the chlorine contracts with our customers due to equipment problems and invoked the force majeure clause in the chlorine  caustic soda  hydrogen  salt and sodium hypochlorite contracts with our customers due to the effects of the hurricane 
the negative impact of these issues was several million dollars 
the plant returned to full operation in late september 
in september  winchester announced that it would relocate its east alton rimfire manufacturing operation to oxford  ms to allow winchester the ability to reduce costs  improve efficiencies  better utilize existing technology and achieve improved profitability in the product line 
this move was completed in the second quarter this relocation impacted approximately salaried and hourly employees  but did not impact the shotshell  centerfire rifle  and pistol manufacturing operations  which are located in east alton  il 
in november  we purchased certain business assets of metal foils llc for million 
metal foils llc is a distributor of aluminum  stainless steel  and copper products located in willoughby  oh 
we relocated the purchased assets to our aj oster facility in alliance  oh in the fourth quarter of year in the first quarter of  we made a decision to close our manufacturing plant in indianapolis  in 
the indianapolis facility ceased operations on february  the plant manufactured copper and copper alloy sheet and strip products and employed approximately people 
production at the indianapolis strip mill has been consolidated within our east alton  il facility 
while the indianapolis strip mill had been an important part of the metals segment since its acquisition in  reduced domestic consumption of strip products combined with capacity additions at east alton lessened the need to maintain the indianapolis production base 
as a result of this closure and certain other actions  we recorded in the first quarter of a pretax restructuring charge of million 
in addition  we recorded in the fourth quarter of  a pretax restructuring charge of million primarily for the write down of certain non us assets  netted with a reduction of a previously established reserve related to our indianapolis restructuring 
the major portion of the first and fourth quarter charges was a non cash charge million related to the loss on disposal or write off of equipment and facilities and goodwill 
the balance of the restructuring charges related to severance and job related benefit costs 
at the indianapolis facility  approximately employees were terminated  while nine employees were transferred to the east alton facility 
in addition to the closing of the indianapolis facility  the metals segment had determined that further cost reductions were necessary due to continuing depressed economic conditions 
approximately employees were terminated to reduce headcount through a combination of a reduction in force program in metals and the relocation of the segment s new haven  ct metals research laboratory activities to two existing manufacturing locations 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an after tax charge of million in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
we adopted this standard on january  and the impairment charge is to reflect the cost of retirement obligations related to our former operating facilities  certain hazardous waste units at our operating plant sites  and our indianapolis facility which was shut down in the first quarter of  as described above 
the after tax charge was recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
in the first quarter of  we were accepted to participate in the irs s settlement initiative pertaining to tax issues relating to our benefits liability management company

gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in from in the gross margin dollar increase of million reflected the higher ecu prices 
the resulting margin percentage increase also reflects the higher ecu selling prices and was offset in part by higher metals sales resulting from increased metal values and by lower gross margins in the metals and winchester segments 
gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of sales were also positively impacted by recoveries from third parties of million of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
selling and administration expenses as a percentage of sales were in and selling and administration expenses in were million higher than in primarily due to a higher level of legal expenses primarily associated with legacy environmental matters  including recovery actions for environmental costs previously incurred and expensed million and third party legal related settlement costs million  pension expense million  and bad debt expense million 
these costs more than offset cost savings of million generated from the corporate office relocation

the restructuring charge in of million was the result of the closure of our manufacturing plant in indianapolis  in and certain other actions 
a major portion of the charge was a non cash charge related to the loss on disposal or write off of equipment and facilities and goodwill 
the balance of the charge related to severance and job related benefit costs 
other operating income for included a non recurring gain of million related to a settlement of a contract matter with an outside third party 
the earnings of non consolidated affiliates were million for  up million from  primarily due to higher ecu pricing and higher volumes at the sunbelt joint venture 
interest expense for  was million  which was equal to lower level of outstanding net debt  as we repaid million in  was offset by the effect of higher interest rates on variable rate debt 
interest income increased million from million in to million in due to higher average cash balances 
other income increased from by million primarily due to a million gain on the sale of our equity interest in an insurance investment  partially offset by lower miscellaneous income in the effective tax rate of for included a million reduction in income tax expense reduction in effective tax rate associated with the settlement of certain issues related to income tax audits for the years through the effective tax rate was higher than the percent us federal statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and income in certain foreign jurisdictions being taxed at higher rates 
for  we recorded a tax provision of million on pretax income of million 
the effective tax rate was higher than the percent us federal statutory rate primarily due to our inability to utilize state and foreign net operating losses in certain jurisdictions and income in other foreign jurisdictions being taxed at higher rates 
in addition  the restructuring charge included the write off of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
segment results we define segment results as income loss before interest expense  interest income  other income  and income taxes and include the results of non consolidated affiliates 
consistent with the guidance in sfas no

the sales increase was due to higher ecu pricing  which increased in and more than offset lower volumes 
in  ecu pricing increased each quarter as price increases were implemented and contract terms and price indexing continued to favorably impact our netbacks gross selling price less freight and discounts throughout the year 
our ecu netback  excluding our sunbelt joint venture  was approximately for compared to approximately for fourth quarter ecu netback was approximately the chlorine and caustic pricing was a result of a tight market  resulting primarily from a strong worldwide economy and the capacity rationalization that has occurred in the us chlor alkali industry 
the volumes in were lower due to the effects of three hurricanes during the third quarter  which caused customer outages and disruptions to the transportation system and a reduction in third party sales volumes 
although none of our facilities were damaged by these hurricanes  these factors reduced our operating rate during the second half of to of capacity  compared to during the second half of our operating rates for were compared to in chlor alkali posted segment income of million  compared to million for segment income was higher in because of higher selling prices million and favorable sunbelt operating results million  which were partially offset by higher operating costs million and lower volumes million 
the higher selling prices at sunbelt were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
the higher operating costs were due to increased electricity costs primarily driven by natural gas and coal prices and increased maintenance expenses 
additionally  operating expenses increased due to higher administrative expenses primarily salaries  incentive compensation resulting from increased segment income  and legal expenses 
the operating results from the sunbelt joint venture included interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  on the sunbelt notes 
compared to chlor alkali products sales for were million compared to million in  an increase million  or 
the sales increase was due to a and a increase in chlorine and caustic volumes and netbacks  respectively 
chlorine and caustic demand increased and respectively  from in  caustic prices declined through the second quarter 
in the third quarter  caustic demand began to improve primarily due to an upturn in the general economy and the industry was able to pass through caustic price increases 
caustic demand was strong in the fourth quarter and additional price increases were implemented and accepted 
the chlor alkali industry produced at high operating rates to support continued strong chlorine demand  both in the us and overseas 
with operating rates at these high levels  average ecu pricing for improved over  as demand remained strong and price increase announcements were accepted as contract terms permit

the favorable pricing and volumes were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs  primarily higher electricity prices  and administrative expenses  primarily salaries  incentive compensation  and legal expenses 
in addition  maintenance related expenses due to the equipment problems and a hurricane at our mcintosh  al facility in the third quarter of negatively impacted income by several million dollars 
sunbelt results improved by million compared with due to higher selling prices and higher volumes  resulting from the completion of a debottlenecking project 
the operating results from the sunbelt joint venture included interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  on the sunbelt notes 
metals compared to sales for were  million compared to sales of  million for  an increase of million  or

the average comex copper price was per pound in compared with per pound in  an increase of 
total shipment volumes decreased by from  while estimated industry demand in was below levels 
overall shipments in were lower than in shipments to the automotive segment decreased in by due to reduced production throughout the us automotive supply chain 
coinage shipments were higher than last year primarily due to increased demand from the us mint mainly resulting from the commemorative nickel program 
shipments to the ammunition segment increased for compared to due to the continued demand for military ordnance 
shipments to our building products customers decreased by from the metals segment reported income of million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
lower earnings were primarily a result of lower shipment volumes in million  higher energy costs million  higher metal melting loss costs caused by higher copper prices million  and higher medical and workers compensation costs million 
in addition  metals earnings were negatively impacted due to the lack of hydrogen availability due to hurricane katrina 
the lack of hydrogen negatively impacted our plant efficiencies and product yields 
the metals earnings were affected by the costs relative to the fire in the electrical control room for the hot mill located at east alton  il of million 
compared to sales for were  million compared to sales in of million  an increase of 
volumes increased as most major market segments increased over the prior year 
the remaining percentage point increase in sales was due to higher metal prices and changes in product mix 
during  the average comex copper price was per pound  compared to per pound in  or an increase of 
shipments to the automotive segment increased in by over as automotive production increased slightly over shipments to the building products segment increased in by over due to increased demand from the construction industry resulting from increased housing starts in coinage shipments were up from last year primarily due to the us mint s second quarter introduction of two new nickels commemorating the th anniversary of the lewis and clark expedition and an improvement in the overall economy 
shipments to the ammunition segment increased over last year primarily due to continued strong demand for military ordnance 
shipments to the electronics segment decreased from last year as demand slowed in the last half of the metals segment income of million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the metals segment improved operating results over last year were primarily the result of increased volumes  improved productivity  the shutdown of our indianapolis facility in and reduced operating costs  offset in part by the costs relative to the fire at the hot mill located at east alton  il of million 
winchester compared to sales were million in compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
shipments of ammunition to the us military increased by million in  while shipments to law enforcement organizations increased million 
domestic commercial sales increased slightly in due to higher selling prices 
the winchester segment reported income of million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the benefits from increased sales volumes and higher selling prices were more than offset by higher copper  lead  steel  and resin costs million  higher medical and workers compensation costs million  and start up costs at the oxford  ms facility 
compared to sales were million for  compared to sales of million for commercial sales volumes accounted for the majority of the increase in from segment income for was million  consistent with s operating income of million 
the favorable profit impact from the higher sales volumes was offset by higher commodity and other manufacturing costs 
corporate other compared to in  pension expense included in corporate other was million compared with pension income of million in the million increase in corporate pension expense was due to the cost impact of plan changes  the impact of a lower discount rate and the higher amortization of plan losses from prior periods  primarily investment losses  on plan assets from prior periods 
on a total company basis  pension expense for was million compared to million in we made a voluntary pension contribution of million in to maintain a funded level as prescribed under erisa 
due to the pension plan contributions in and  no mandatory contributions will be required until among other factors  changes in interest rates and pension fund investment performance could alter this forecast 
we may elect to make selective voluntary contributions  when appropriate  between now and we discuss our assumptions with respect to pension estimates under critical accounting policies and estimates 
credits to income for investigatory and remedial activities were million for  which included million in recoveries from third parties of environmental costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
charges to income for investigatory and remedial activities  without these recoveries in  would have been million in compared with million in these charges relate primarily to expected future remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
environmental costs for on going plant operations  for example wastewater treatment  are included in the operating segments and are approximately equal year over year 
for  other corporate and unallocated costs were million compared with million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to higher legal expenses related to a higher level of legal and legal related settlement expenses associated with legacy environmental matters  including recovery actions for environmental costs previously incurred and expensed million  incentive compensation expense million due to higher earnings  employee benefit expenses million as a result of reinstating company matched ceop contributions that had been suspended in and workers compensation costs  and consulting fees million 
these increases more than offset the cost savings resulting from the corporate headquarters relocation million 
compared to for  pension income included in corporate other was million compared with million in the reduction in corporate pension income was due to the recognition of actuarial losses  which primarily relate to differences in assumed and actual asset returns  and lower interest rates  partially offset by higher expected investment income on a higher level of plan assets 
in  we recorded total pension expense of million compared to total pension expense of million in the service costs and prior service cost components of pension expense  which are included in the operating segments and in other corporate and unallocated costs  were approximately equal in both years 
in  we updated our pension related projections based on the interest rate guidance provided by the treasury department as a result of the pension funding equity act of  which was enacted on april  its use caused differences in the timing of future contributions  not their magnitude  from what we had previously projected 
on february   we issued and sold million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net proceeds from the sale were million and were used in part to make a voluntary contribution of million to our pension plan 
in september  we made a second voluntary pension plan contribution of million 
this contribution eliminated a pension benefit guaranty corporation insurance variable rate premium of million that would have otherwise become payable from the pension plan assets in for  charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities were million compared with million in this provision related primarily to expected future remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
the increase in the annual environmental charges to income is primarily attributable to additional liabilities for alleged groundwater contamination at a former plant site 
for  other corporate and unallocated costs were million compared with million in this increase was primarily due to higher expenses such as higher legal fees and settlement costs million  professional services primarily associated with the sarbanes oxley act million and management compensation expenses million 
in november  we sold our indianapolis facility  which alleviated our remaining asset retirement obligation  which we recorded in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
in this reduction decreased corporate other expenses by million in outlook in chlor alkali  we feel we are well positioned for a stronger year in than we expect further improvements in ecu netbacks in the first quarter of based on the previously announced price increases and favorable contract rollovers 
volumes in the first quarter of are expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter of as gulf coast customers increase operating rates 
as part of the ongoing cost reduction efforts in our metals business  we have decided to close our waterbury rolling mills facility in waterbury  ct 
in conjunction with this action  we will consolidate these production activities into our east alton  il mill 
we are also considering decisions regarding the possible restructuring or closure of additional facilities  along with other overhead reductions 
these decisions should be made by the end of the first quarter 
we intend to record a one time pretax charge for these actions of million to million in  most of which will occur in the first quarter of we expect this charge to be partially offset by one time inventory gains associated with lifo liquidations of approximately million in we believe these actions will generate annual cost savings in the million to million range  and the implementation of these actions is expected to be cash neutral 
in winchester  we expect some improvement in profitability in compared to  as higher selling prices and the impact of cost reductions begin to offset the high level of commodity costs  particularly for lead and copper 
winchester also expects its revenue from military sales to increase in compared to we currently project that pension expense in will be approximately million higher than this increase reflects the adverse impact of lower discount rates and the continued amortization of plan losses from prior periods 
stock option expense in is projected to be approximately million  and charges to income for environmental investigatory and remedial activities may be in the million range 
our capital spending and depreciation are both projected to be in the million range 
environmental matters in millions cash outlays remedial and investigatory spending charged to reserve recoveries from third parties capital spending plant operations charged to cost of goods sold total cash outlays reserve for environmental liabilities beginning balance charges to income remedial and investigatory spending ending balance the establishment and implementation of federal  state  and local standards to regulate air  water and land quality has affected and will continue to affect substantially all of our manufacturing locations 
federal legislation providing for regulation of the manufacture  transportation  use  and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances  and remediation of contaminated sites  has imposed additional regulatory requirements on industry  particularly the chemicals industry 
in addition  implementation of environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and the clean air act  has required and will continue to require new capital expenditures and will increase plant operating costs 
we employ waste minimization and pollution prevention programs at our manufacturing sites 
we are party to various governmental and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites 
associated costs of investigatory and remedial activities are provided for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles governing probability and the ability to reasonably estimate future costs 
our ability to estimate future costs depends on whether our investigatory and remedial activities are in preliminary or advanced stages 
with respect to unasserted claims  we accrue liabilities for costs that  in our experience  we may incur to protect our interests against those unasserted claims 
our accrued liabilities for unasserted claims amounted to million at december  with respect to asserted claims  we accrue liabilities based on remedial investigation  feasibility study  remedial action and operation  maintenance and monitoring om m expenses that  in our experience  we may incur in connection with the asserted claims 
required site om m expenses are estimated and accrued in their entirety for required periods not exceeding years  which reasonably approximates the typical duration of long term site om m 
charges or credits to income for investigatory and remedial efforts were material to operating results in   and and may be material to net income in future years 
in  the credit to income for investigatory and remedial activities was million  which includes million of recoveries from third parties of costs incurred and expensed in prior periods 
without these recoveries  charges to income for investigatory and remedial activities would have been million in and were million and million in and  respectively 
these charges relate primarily to remedial and investigatory activities associated with past manufacturing operations and former waste disposal sites 
cash outlays for remedial and investigatory activities associated with former waste sites and past operations were not charged to income but instead were charged to reserves established for such costs identified and expensed to income in prior years 
cash outlays for normal plant operations for the disposal of waste and the operation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and facilities to ensure compliance with mandated and voluntarily imposed environmental quality standards were charged to income 
total environmental related cash outlays for are estimated to be million  of which million is expected to be spent on investigatory and remedial efforts  million on capital projects and million on normal plant operations 
historically  we have funded our environmental capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and expect to do so in the future 
our estimated environmental liability at the end of was attributable to sites  of which were usepa national priority list npl sites 
ten sites accounted for of such liability and  of the remaining sites  no one site accounted for more than of our environmental liability 
at one of these ten sites remedial plan has been submitted by us and a record of decision rod or its equivalent has not been issued 
at five of the ten sites  part of the site is subject to a remedial investigation and another part is in the long term om m stage 
the four remaining sites are in long term om m 
all ten sites are either associated with past manufacturing operations or former waste disposal sites 
none of the ten largest sites represents more than of the liabilities reserved on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures 
our consolidated balance sheets included liabilities for future environmental expenditures to investigate and remediate known sites amounting to million at december   and million at december   of which million and million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities  respectively 
those amounts did not take into account any discounting of future expenditures or any consideration of insurance recoveries or advances in technology 
those liabilities are reassessed periodically to determine if environmental circumstances have changed and or remediation efforts and our estimate of related costs have changed 
as a result of these reassessments  future charges to income may be made for additional liabilities 
of the million included on our consolidated balance sheet at december  for future environmental expenditures  we currently expect to utilize million of the reserve for future environmental expenditures over the next years  million for expenditures to years in the future  and million for expenditures beyond years in the future 
these estimates are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  as described in item a 
risk factors environmental costs 
annual environmental related cash outlays for site investigation and remediation  capital projects  and normal plant operations are expected to range between million to million over the next several years  million to million of which is for investigatory and remedial efforts  which are expected to be charged against reserves recorded on our balance sheet 
while we do not anticipate a material increase in the projected annual level of our environmental related costs  there is always the possibility that such increases may occur in the future in view of the uncertainties associated with environmental exposures 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other prps and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
at december   we estimate we may have additional contingent environmental liabilities of million in addition to the amounts for which we have already recorded as a reserve 
legal matters we and our subsidiaries are defendants in various legal actions including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos incidental to our past and current business activities 
we describe some of these matters in item legal proceedings 
while we believe that none of these legal actions will materially adversely impact our financial position  in light of the inherent uncertainties of the litigation concerning alleged exposures  we cannot at this time determine whether the financial impact  if any  of these matters will be material to our results of operations

in  cash utilized by operating activities included pension plan contributions of million and tax payments of million 
in  accounts receivable increased million  primarily due to higher ecu prices in chlor alkali products and higher copper prices in metals 
days sales outstanding decreased by approximately two days as all business segments improved their days sales outstanding 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by million  primarily due to the higher copper prices related to the metal purchases and the timing of invoice payments 
the increase in the fourth quarter average comex price of copper was a major contributor to the increase in accounts payables 
in february  we made a voluntary contribution of million to our pension plan from the proceeds of our common stock offering and then  in september we made a second voluntary contribution of million to our pension plan 
in april  we made tax payments of million pertaining to the settlement of certain issues related to income tax audits for the years through excluding these pension contributions and tax payments  cash provided by operating activities decreased from the prior year due primarily to a higher investment in working capital  particularly higher accounts receivables and inventories 
the investment in accounts receivable and inventories was higher in by million and million  respectively  primarily due to higher sales volumes in all segments and higher metal prices 
the increase in the fourth quarter average comex price of copper from was a major contributor to the increase in accounts receivable and inventories 
capital expenditures capital spending was million in  million in  and million in capital spending in was million higher than the increase was due in part to the relocation of a winchester product line and an increase in maintenance and reliability projects in the chlor alkali products and metals operations and investments in transportation equipment for chlor alkali products 
capital spending in was of depreciation compared to in disposition of property  plant and equipment consisted primarily of the proceeds from the real estate transactions 
in  we plan to manage our capital spending to a level in line with our depreciation  or about million  a decrease of below the amount 
the decrease is primarily attributable to higher spending in for transportation equipment in chlor alkali products and the relocation of the winchester product line

in november  we purchased certain business assets of metal foils llc for million 
metal foils llc is a distributor of aluminum  stainless steel  and copper products located in willoughby  oh 
we relocated the purchased assets to our aj oster facility in alliance  oh 
the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired by million 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million represented the equity value of the coli program which we discontinued in the first quarter of we surrendered the life insurance policies that we purchased under this program  and received these proceeds in march in april  we sold our equity interest in an insurance investment 
in june  we sold our aegis business to hcc industries inc the proceeds from these sales approximated million 
financing activities on july  we entered into a five year senior revolving credit facility of million  which will expire on july  at december   we had million available under this senior revolving credit facility 
we issued million of letters of credit under an million letter of credit subfacility for the purpose of supporting certain long term debt  certain workers compensation insurance policies  and plant closure and post closure obligations 
under the facility  we may select various floating rate borrowing options 
it includes various customary restrictive covenants  including restrictions related to the ratio of debt to earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization leverage ratio and the ratio of earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense coverage ratio 
in connection with the relocation of winchester s rimfire operations to oxford  ms  in november  we completed an industrial development revenue bond financing of million to utilize certain state tax incentives

these shares were issued to satisfy the investment in our common stock resulting from employee contributions  our matching contributions and re invested dividends 
the percent of total debt to total capitalization decreased to at december   from at year end and at year end the decrease from year end was due primarily to the higher shareholders equity resulting from the net income for the year and the repayment of the million  medium term series a notes in june the decrease from year end was due primarily to the higher shareholders equity resulting from the issuance of million shares of our common stock in february  along with the repayment of our long term debt obligations  which became due primarily in march and june of dividends per common share were in  and total dividends paid on common stock amounted to million in  million in and million in the payment of cash dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will be determined in light of then current conditions  including our earnings  our operations  our financial conditions  our capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
in the future  our board of directors may change our dividend policy  including the frequency or amount of any dividend  in light of then existing conditions 
liquidity and other financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and short term borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
we also have access to the debt and equity markets 
cash flow from operations is variable as a result of the cyclical nature of our operating results  which have been affected recently by economic cycles in many of the industries we serve  such as vinyls  urethanes  pulp and paper  automotive  electronics and the telecommunications sectors 
in addition  cash flow from operations is affected by changes in ecu selling prices caused by the changes in the supply demand balance of chlorine and caustic  resulting in the chlor alkali business having significant leverage on our earnings 
for example  assuming all other costs remain constant and internal consumption remains approximately the same  a per ecu selling price change equates to an approximate million annual change in our revenues and pretax profit when we are operating at full capacity 
our current debt structure is used to fund our business operations  and commitments from banks under our revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings  including the current installment  of million of which million was at variable rates 
we have entered into interest rate swaps on million of our underlying debt obligations whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
the counterparty to these agreements is a major financial institution 
we have designated the swap agreements as fair value hedges of the risk of changes in the value of fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates for a portion of our fixed rate borrowings under sfas no 
accordingly  the swap agreements have been recorded at their fair market value of million and are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related debt 
no gain or loss has been recorded as the contracts met the criteria of sfas no

the price for the sulfur dioxide is fixed over the life of the contract and  under the terms of the contract  we are obligated to make a monthly payment of million regardless of the amount of sulfur dioxide purchased 
commitments related to this agreement are million per year for the years through and million in this supply agreement expires in we utilize a credit facility and standby letters of credit 
in july  we entered into a new five year senior revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
this credit facility is described above under the caption  financing activities

at december   we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit were used to support certain long term debt  certain workers compensation insurance policies  and plant closure and post closure obligations 
on february   we issued and sold million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of

oxy vinyls a joint venture between oxychem and polyone is required to purchase thousand tons of chlorine based on a formula related to its market price 
we market the excess chlorine and all of the caustic produced 
the construction of this plant and equipment was financed by the issuance of million of guaranteed senior secured notes due the sunbelt joint venture sold million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series o  and million of guaranteed senior secured notes due  series g 
we refer to these notes as the sunbelt notes 
the sunbelt notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable semiannually in arrears on each june and december we have guaranteed the series o notes  and polyone has guaranteed the series g notes  in both cases pursuant to customary guaranty agreements 
our guarantee and polyone s guarantee are several  rather than joint 
therefore  we are not required to make any payments to satisfy the series g notes guaranteed by polyone 
an insolvency or bankruptcy of polyone will not automatically trigger acceleration of the sunbelt notes or cause us to be required to make payments under our guarantee  even if polyone is required to make payments under its guarantee 
however  if the sunbelt joint venture does not make timely payments on the sunbelt notes  whether as a result of a failure to pay on a guarantee or otherwise  the holders of the sunbelt notes may proceed against the assets of the sunbelt joint venture for repayment 
if we were to make debt service payments under our guarantee  we would have a right to recover such payments from the sunbelt joint venture 
beginning on december  and each year through  our sunbelt joint venture is required to repay million of the sunbelt notes  of which million is attributable to the series o notes 
after the payment of million on the series o notes in december  our guarantee of these notes was million 
in the event our sunbelt joint venture cannot make any of these payments  we would be required to fund our half of such payment 
in certain other circumstances  we may also be required to repay the sunbelt notes prior to their maturity 
we and polyone have agreed that  if we or polyone intend to transfer our respective interests in the sunbelt joint venture and the transferring party is unable to obtain consent from holders of of the aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness related to the guarantee being transferred after good faith negotiations  then we and polyone will be required to repay our respective portions of the sunbelt notes 
in such event  any make whole or similar penalties or costs will be paid by the transferring party

given the inherent uncertainty as to actual minimum funding requirements for qualified pension plans and the uncertain level of postretirement benefit payments  no amounts are included in this table for any period beyond one year in the case of pensions and two years in the case of postretirement benefits 
it is likely we will make cash payments in future periods 
the contractual commitments  shown above  except for our debt obligations  are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
non cancelable operating leases and purchasing commitments are utilized in our normal course of business for our projected needs 
for losses that we believe are probable and which are estimable we have accrued for such amounts in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the table above  we have various commitments and contingencies including defined benefit and postretirement healthcare plans as described below  environmental matters see environmental matters included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  tax exposures see item a 
risk factors tax audits  and litigation claims see item legal proceedings 
we have several defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as described in the pension and other postretirement benefit plans note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we fund these plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus such amounts we deem appropriate 
we have postretirement healthcare plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired and active employees and their beneficiaries  as described in the pension and other postretirement benefit plans note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these plans are generally not pre funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred 
we also have standby letters of credit of million of which million have been issued through our senior revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million available under our senior revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant estimates in our consolidated financial statements include goodwill recoverability  environmental  restructuring and other unusual items  litigation  income tax reserves including deferred tax asset valuation allowances  pension  postretirement and other benefits and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances and other assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually 
goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed annually in the fourth quarter and or when circumstances or other events indicate that impairment may have occurred 
the annual impairment test involves the comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined based on a variety of assumptions including estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  discount rates  and comparable company trading multiples 
based on our evaluation prepared in the fourth quarter of  no impairment charge was recorded 
environmental accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing technologies 
these amounts  which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties  are adjusted periodically as assessments and remediation efforts progress or additional technical or legal information becomes available 
environmental exposures are difficult to assess for numerous reasons  including the identification of new sites  developments at sites resulting from investigatory studies  advances in technology  changes in environmental laws and regulations and their application  the scarcity of reliable data pertaining to identified sites  the difficulty in assessing the involvement and financial capability of other potentially responsible parties and our ability to obtain contributions from other parties and the lengthy time periods over which site remediation occurs 
it is possible that some of these matters the outcomes of which are subject to various uncertainties may be resolved unfavorably to us  which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
pension and postretirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and non pension postretirement benefit plans using actuarial models required by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads the financial impact of changes to the plan and actuarial assumptions over the average remaining service lives of the employees in the plan 
changes in liability due to changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  rate of compensation increases and mortality  as well as annual deviations between what was assumed and what was experienced by the plan are treated as gains or losses 
additionally  gains and losses are amortized over the group s service lifetime  to the extent they fall outside of a corridor designed to dampen annual volatility 
the average remaining service lives of the employee plan is years 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their average remaining service lives on a relatively smooth basis and  therefore  the accounting for benefits earned under the pension or non pension postretirement benefits plans should follow the same relatively smooth pattern 
one of the key assumptions for the net periodic pension calculation is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  used to determine the market related value of assets 
the market related value of assets recognizes differences between the plan s actual return and expected return over a five year period 
the required use of an expected long term rate of return on the market related value of plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and  therefore  result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
as differences between actual and expected returns are recognized over five years  they generate gains and losses that are subject to amortization over the average remaining service life of the group  as described in the preceding paragraph 
we use long term historical actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets  and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources to develop the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate assumptions used for pension and non pension postretirement benefit plan accounting reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments on december of each year 
the rate of compensation increase is based upon our long term plans for such increases 
for retiree medical plan accounting  we review external data and our own historical trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions resulting from economic events 
for example  holding all other assumptions constant  a one hundred basis point decrease or increase in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would have increased or decreased  respectively  the pension cost by approximately million 
holding all other assumptions constant  a basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension costs for and the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  would have increased pension costs by million and the accumulated benefit obligation by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate used to calculate pension costs for and the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  would have decreased pension costs by million and the accumulated benefit obligation by million

new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this pronouncement revises the accounting treatment for stock based compensation 
it establishes standards for the accounting transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
this cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
it requires that we will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on their current fair value  the aggregate value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
originally  this statement was effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that began after june  in april  the sec postponed the effective date of this statement to fiscal years beginning after june  first quarter for calendar year companies 
based upon the prospective adoption of sfas no 
revised  the non cash pretax impact for is expected to approximate million 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies the definition of conditional asset retirement obligations used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation also clarifies when a company would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
on december   we adopted fin no 
as a result  we recorded an asset of million and a liability of million to reflect the cost of retirement obligations related to production technology million  building materials million  and other obligations million 
this resulted in an after tax charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change totaling million million pretax upon adoption of fin no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principle were recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  derivative financial instruments sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we use hedge accounting treatment for substantially all of our business transactions whose risks are covered using derivative instruments 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivatives designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of both the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
ineffective portions are recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognized currently in earnings 
we enter into forward sales and purchase contracts to manage currency risk resulting from purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally australian dollar and canadian dollar 
all of the currency derivatives expire within one year and are for united states dollar equivalents 
at december  and we had forward contracts to buy foreign currencies with face value of million and million  respectively  and no forward contracts to sell foreign currencies 
the fair market value of the forward contracts to buy at december  and approximated the carrying value 
the counterparty to the forward contracts is a large financial institution 
the risk of loss to us in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty would not be significant to our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange gains  net of taxes  were million in  million in  and million in we use cash flow hedges of certain raw materials and energy costs such as copper  zinc  lead and natural gas to provide a measure of stability in managing our exposure to price fluctuations 
we use interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest rates on our outstanding debt obligations 
these interest rate swaps are treated as fair value hedges 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on the hedge designation and whether the hedge is effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability being hedged 
gains losses on settled futures contracts  net of taxes  were million in  million in  and million in at december   we had open positions in futures contracts totaling million million 
if all open futures contracts had been settled on december   we would have recognized a gain of million 
at december  and  accumulated other comprehensive loss included a pretax gain loss in fair value of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the unfavorable ineffective portion of changes in fair value resulted in million  million and million charge credit to earnings for the years ended december   and  respectively 
offsetting the above  there were in assets totaling million million and liabilities of million million 
our foreign currency forward contracts and certain commodity derivatives did not meet the criteria of sfas no 
to qualify for hedge accounting 
the cumulative effect of items not qualifying for hedge accounting for was not material to earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to our operations in different foreign currencies  our purchases of certain commodities  and our ongoing investing and financing activities 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows and future earnings 
we have established policies and procedures governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage exposure to such risks 
energy costs including electricity used in our chlor alkali products segment  and certain raw materials and energy costs  namely copper  lead  zinc and natural gas used primarily in our metals and winchester segments products are subject to price volatility 
depending on market conditions  we may enter into futures contracts and put and call option contracts in order to reduce the impact of metal price fluctuations 
as of december   we maintained open positions on futures contracts totaling million million at december  
assuming a hypothetical increase in commodity prices  which are currently hedged  we would experience a million million at december  increase in our cost of inventory purchased  which would be offset by a corresponding increase in the value of related hedging instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our investing and financing activities 
investing activity is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
our existing debt structure is used to fund business operations and commitments from banks under our revolving credit facility are a source of liquidity 
as of december   we had long term borrowings of million million at december  of which million million at december  was issued at variable rates 
as a result of our fixed rate financings  we entered into floating interest rate swaps in order to manage interest expense and floating interest rate exposure to optimal levels 
we have entered into million of such swaps  whereby we agree to pay variable rates to a counterparty who  in turn  pays us fixed rates 
in all cases the underlying index for the variable rates is six month london interbank offered rate libor 
accordingly  payments are settled every six months and the term of the swap is the same as the underlying debt instrument 
the following table reflected the swap activity related to certain debt obligations as of december  underlying debt instrument swap amount date of swap december  floating rate in millions  due december  due february a  due march a industrial development and environmental improvement obligations at fixed interest rates of to  due march march a actual rate is set in arrears 
we project the rate will fall within the range shown 
these interest rate swaps reduced interest expense  resulting in an increase in pretax profit of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
if the actual change in interest or commodities pricing is substantially different than expected  the net impact of interest rate risk or commodity risk on our cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
