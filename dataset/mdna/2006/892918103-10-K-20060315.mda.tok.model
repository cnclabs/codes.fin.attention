overview the year was a challenging year for transact 
our results were dramatically impacted by an overall slowdown in the domestic gaming market  including the effect of hurricane katrina  an issue at a major gaming oem customer as it depletes a large inventory position  lower capital spending due to mergers of major casino operators  and lower than historical levels of lottery printer sales to gtech  our largest customer 
despite our disappointing financial results and a less than ideal set of market conditions  we continued on our planned course of making substantial strategic investments into the growth elements of our business 
this led to a number of strategic successes during including the following established three strategic sales units to focus on each of our markets doubled the size of our sales force company wide opened our new gaming and lottery headquarters and western regional service center in las vegas  nevada launched seven new products  including our new line of epic printers for the new off premise global gaming market  and our new line of printers  exclusively for our pos distributors entered into a strategic sales alliance with jcm american corporation jcm  the worldwide leading bill acceptor company  to sell our casino printers grew our international gaming sales by over to million achieved standard printer status with igt  including the integration of our epic tm casino printer in every slot machine platform in every jurisdiction in which igt competes received five new patents  including a key one in connection with dual port technology we continue to focus on sales growth in our two core markets  point of sale pos and banking and gaming and lottery  and in our recently established transact services group  to drive increased profitability 
during  our total net sales decreased by to approximately  see the table below for a breakdown of our sales 
change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  pos and banking    gaming and lottery    transact services group   total net sales    we experienced a decrease of approximately in sales of pos and banking printers in  driven primarily by lower project oriented banking printer sales 
during  we announced wins from two major financial services companies for shipments of over  bankjet r printers to upgrade bank teller applications  which we began to ship in and substantially completed shipping during during  we announced and shipped approximately  bankjet r printers for our third major bank win 
excluding the project oriented banking market  sales of pos printers increased by from we expect the upward trend in the pos market to accelerate during given our success over the last three years  and in light of the renewed focus we see banks placing on branch banking  we plan to continue proactively to seek opportunities with other banks and credit unions for upgrading bank teller systems 
in  we also plan to increase our focus on selling through our distribution and reseller channels in an effort to expand sales of our new line of printers exclusively for these channels  and to continue to broaden our product portfolio 
with the global pos printer market of approximately million  we have many opportunities for market share gains  primarily through increasing and enhancing our product portfolio  increasing geographic coverage  and growing our customer base 
our focus in the gaming and lottery market is two fold 
on the lottery side  we continue to hold a leading position based on our long term purchase agreement through with gtech corporation gtech  our largest customer and the world s largest provider of lottery terminals  with approximately a market share 
gtech has been our customer since  and we continue to maintain a good relationship with them 
currently  we fulfill substantially all of gtech s printer requirements for lottery terminal installations and upgrades 
during  total printer sales to gtech were approximately  lower than in  representing a decrease of approximately 
based on existing orders and expected future demand for our lottery printers estimated with input from gtech  we expect overall sales to gtech in to be modestly higher than the level 
our sales to gtech each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations gtech performs 
our sales to gtech are not indicative of gtech s overall business or revenue 
on the gaming side  our focus lies primarily in supplying printers for use in slot machines in casinos and racetracks  as well as in other gaming devices that print tickets  primarily in the united states  europe and australia 
during  our gaming printer sales were significantly impacted by a weak domestic casino market  including the effect of hurricane katrina  lower capital spending due to mergers of major casino operators  and an issue at a large gaming oem customer as it depletes a large inventory position 
as a result  sales of our gaming printers decreased by 
although we are not projecting a recovery of the domestic gaming market during  we still expect to see approximately double digit growth in our worldwide gaming sales in compared to we expect to gain market share in the united states due to our new strategic alliance agreement with jcm  the worldwide leading bill acceptor company  to sell our casino printers our relationship with igt  the world s largest slot machine manufacturer  and expanded acceptance of our new epic tm thermal casino printer 
in addition  we expect a return to more normalized purchasing levels by the large gaming oem customer mentioned above beginning in the second quarter overall  we expect to continue to exploit opportunities for casino printer sales as the rollout of the ticket in ticket out initiative continues and the size of the north american slot machine market continues to expand to over  slot machines 
in the international gaming market  we experienced record sales growth during  as our international gaming sales almost tripled to million 
we expect continued strength from gaming sales internationally during  as markets such as europe and australia continue to adopt ticket printing for their slot machines and other gaming machines  and as our new line of epic printer launched in for the off premise gaming market begin to take hold 
our transact services group tsg  which sells service and consumable products  including printer repairs and the sale of spare parts and consumables paper  ribbons and inkjet cartridges  offers a substantial growth opportunity and recurring revenue stream for transact 
tsg revenue has grown to  or of net sales in  representing an increase of from during  we plan to continue to actively promote our service and consumable products in an effort to increase the volume of sales 
with the investments we made in tsg during including the addition of four dedicated sales people  a specialized software system that improved our sales lead tracking and prospecting processes  and the establishment of two new service centers a western region service center in las vegas  nv and an eastern region service center in wallingford  ct we believe we are now even better positioned to accelerate the growth of tsg sales in in addition  we believe that the increasing sales of our inkjet printers will lead to a growing installed base that will drive substantially higher inkjet cartridge sales in and beyond 
operationally  gross margin and operating margin for were impacted by lower sales  and our decision to make a strategic investment of million in the growth elements of our business 
we made this investment across three areas an incremental million investment in sales and marketing  a  incremental investment in engineering expenses for the development and launch of seven new products  and a  investment in operating expenses related to the opening and staffing of our new service center in las vegas and the hiring of additional services personnel in our wallingford service center 
we expect that  over the long term  the investment we made in will accelerate our revenue growth and with our operating leverage  should lead to improved operating results beginning in the first quarter despite the challenging year and our increased level of investment  we reported net income and positive earnings per share diluted for we also generated sufficient cash during to fund million of capital expenditures and repurchase million of our common stock approximately of our common stock outstanding and finished the year with million of cash and no debt on our balance sheet as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances 
those judgments affect both balance sheet items and income statement categories 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  goodwill impairment  warranty obligations  restructuring accruals and contingent liabilities 
we evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates 
actual results may differ from the original estimates 
the following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our typical contracts include the sale of printers  which are sometimes accompanied by separately priced extended warranty contracts 
we also sell spare parts  consumables  and other repair services sometimes pursuant to multi year product maintenance contracts  which are not included in the original printer sale and are ordered by the customer as needed 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within sab  revenue recognition 
specifically  revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery based on shipping terms which are generally fob shipping point has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition 
revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized pursuant to fasb technical bulletin ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
pursuant to ftb  revenue related to separately priced product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the term of the maintenance period 
we record deferred revenue for amounts received from customers for maintenance contracts prior to the maintenance period 
our customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
we offer some of our customers price protection as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and we infrequently lower prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under these plans have not been material 
however  we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  or of outstanding accounts receivable  which we feel is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
as of december   we had accounts receivable balances due from one customer of approximately of the total balance due  and no other customer accounts receivable balance exceeded 
as of december   we had accounts receivable balances due from three customers of  and  respectively  of the total balance due  and no other customer accounts receivable balance exceeded 
inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we assess market value based on historical usage and estimates of future demand 
assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changing market conditions 
should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence  additional write downs of inventory could result in a charge to income 
as of december   our net inventory included a reserve of  or of gross inventory to write inventory down to lower of cost or market 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately  related primarily to the write down of inventory for our model casino printer  as demand for this printer is declining due to the faster than expected acceptance of our new epic tm casino printer 
we also disposed of approximately  of fully reserved inventory related to discontinued printer models during the fourth quarter of as a result  our inventory reserve at december  increased by only approximately from december goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment as of december  factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to  at december  and we have determined that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  as well as net operating losses  tax credits and other carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years  and match this forecast against the basis differences  deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance or tax reserve  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   we recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately  net of a valuation allowance of  and a tax reserve of  primarily on portions of certain tax credits 
we will need to recognize approximately million in future taxable income in order to realize all of our deferred tax assets at december  based on our projection of future taxable income  no additional valuation allowance is considered necessary 
should circumstances change and we determine that some or all of the deferred taxes would not be realized  a valuation allowance would be recorded  resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
restructuring in february  we announced plans to establish a global engineering and manufacturing center at our ithaca  ny facility 
as part of this strategic decision  we undertook a plan to consolidate all manufacturing and engineering into our existing ithaca  ny facility and close our wallingford  ct manufacturing facility the consolidation 
however  our company headquarters and a service center remain in wallingford  ct 
our technology shift to inkjet and thermal printing from dot matrix impact printing dramatically reduced the labor content in our printers  and therefore  lowered the required production capacity 
as of december   we successfully transferred substantially all our wallingford product lines to ithaca  ny  with the exception of a service center that remains in connecticut 
the closing of the wallingford manufacturing facility resulted in the related termination of employment of approximately production  administrative and management employees 
in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in  we recorded significant accruals 
through december   we have recognized approximately million of expenses associated with the consolidation  including severance pay  stay bonuses  employee benefits  moving expenses  non cancelable lease payments  and other costs  of which approximately million and million were recognized in and  respectively 
no additional restructuring expense was recognized in management has made reasonable estimates of such costs and expenses 
however  if actual costs differ from the estimates  charges or credits to income could result in the period the adjustments are determined 
we changed our estimate of the restructuring accrual related to the wallingford  ct facility  resulting in additional restructuring expense in  and a reversal of restructuring expense in we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring expenses related to the consolidation 
see the liquidity and capital resources section for a discussion of the expected impact of the consolidation on our future results of operations and cash flows 
warranty we generally warrant our products for up to months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded 
estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs 
if actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made 
contingencies we record an estimated liability related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes pursuant to fas on a quarterly basis  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge to cost of goods sold of approximately  related to estimated settlement cancellation payments for non cancelable purchase orders for certain excess inventory components related to our model casino ticket printer 
the charge was largely the result of the faster than expected acceptance of our new epic tm casino ticket printer  which replaces our model casino ticket printer 
stock based compensation we apply the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles whereby compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period to the extent that the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant exceeds the exercise price of the employee stock option 
beginning january   we will be required to recognize expense pursuant to financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r for stock based compensation 
we will utilize the black scholes model to value share based payments and will follow the modified prospective transition method 
the black scholes model uses judgmental inputs such as option life  expected volatility and expected forfeiture rate 
changes in these inputs may change the amount of expense recognized for stock options issued during the period of change 
a results of operations certain sales by market amounts for and have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation in the narrative below 
i year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales  which include printer sales and sales of spare parts  consumables and repair services  by market for the years ended december  and were as follows change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  point of sale and banking    gaming and lottery    transact services group   international    international sales do not include sales of printers made to domestic distributors or other domestic customers who in turn ship those printers to international destinations 
net sales for decreased  or  from due to significantly lower printer shipments into our gaming and lottery market  as well as lower printer shipments into our pos and banking market 
however  sales from our transact services group increased by  or  from  as our installed base of printers grows and as we continue to aggressively pursue these after market sales 
overall  international sales almost doubled to  due largely to higher international shipments of our gaming printers  primarily to europe and australia  as well as international shipments of lottery printers to gtech 
point of sale and banking revenue from the pos and banking market includes sales of inkjet  thermal and impact printers used primarily by retailers in the hospitality  restaurant including fine dining  casual dining and fast food and specialty retail industries to print receipts for consumers  validate checks  or print on other inserted media 
revenue from this market also includes sales of printers used by banks  credit unions and other financial institutions to print and or validate receipts at bank teller stations 
sales of our pos and banking printers worldwide decreased approximately  or  from change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  domestic    international   domestic pos and banking printer sales decreased to  or  due largely to significantly lower shipments of our bankjet r line of inkjet printers in as compared to we experienced this decrease due to the project oriented nature of banking printer sales 
during  we shipped banking printers to two top tier financial services companies 
however  during  we shipped banking printers primarily to only one top tier financial services company 
the decrease in banking printer sales was slightly offset by increasing sales of our pos printers  primarily our itherm tm thermal printer and our new line of printers exclusively for pos distributors 
excluding banking printers  sales of our pos printers increased by in compared to international pos and banking printer sales increased by approximately  or  due primarily to higher sales through our growing network of international pos distributors in europe and latin america  somewhat offset by lower sales to distributors in the pacific rim 
we expect sales into the pos and banking market for the first quarter of to be higher than those reported for the fourth quarter of  due largely to expected shipments of banking printers to an existing financial services company 
we also expect full year sales for to be modestly higher than those reported during  as we expect our initiatives and four new pos products launched in to begin to take hold 
gaming and lottery revenue from the gaming and lottery market includes sales of printers used in slot machines  video lottery terminals vlts and other gaming machines that print tickets instead of issuing coins ticket in  ticket out or tito at casinos  racetracks racinos and other gaming venues worldwide 
revenue from this market also includes sales of lottery printers to gtech  the world s largest provider of lottery terminals  for various lottery applications 
sales of our gaming and lottery printers decreased by  or  from  primarily due to a decrease in sales of slot machine printers in north america  as well as a decrease in sales of lottery printers to gtech 
this decrease was partially offset by significantly higher sales of our slot machine and other gaming printers in europe and australia 
change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  domestic    international    domestic sales of our gaming and lottery printers declined by  or  from due to the continued decline in slot machine sales into the domestic casino market  including the effects of hurricane katrina  lower capital spending due to mergers of major casino operators  and the loss of revenue from a large slot machine manufacturer as it depletes a large inventory position  we experienced significantly lower sales of our tito casino printers throughout north america during although we are not projecting a recovery of the domestic casino market during  we expect sales into the gaming market for the first quarter of to be higher than those reported for the fourth quarter of  and also expect full year sales for to be modestly higher than those reported during we expect growth in our gaming sales during due to expected continued market share gains in the domestic market  aided by our new strategic sales alliance with jcm american corporation  the worldwide leading bill acceptor company  to sell our casino printers a return to normalized purchasing levels by the large slot machine manufacturer mentioned above during the second quarter  and expanded acceptance of our new epic tm casino ticket printer by casinos 
printer sales to gtech corporation a worldwide lottery terminal provider and major customer  which include impact and thermal on line lottery printers  decreased by approximately  or  in compared to this decrease was largely due to shipments of legacy impact printers to gtech in that did not recur in we do not expect any future orders for legacy impact printers  as gtech replaced our legacy impact on line lottery printer with our new thermal on line lottery printer 
however  we do expect to continue to sell spare parts to gtech for the significant remaining installed base of impact on line lottery printers 
based on existing orders and expected future demand based on input from gtech  we expect overall sales to gtech in to be higher than those reported for  with more substantial growth expected in the first half of our sales to gtech each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations gtech performs and are not indicative of gtech s overall business or revenue 
international gaming and lottery printer sales more than tripled to  in compared to such sales represented and of total sales into our gaming and lottery market during and  respectively 
we experienced growth in both international gaming and lottery printer sales in as markets in europe and australia continue to adopt and roll out ticket printing in slot machines and other gaming amusement machines  and gtech installs our lottery printers in its international markets 
due to the significant growth of our international gaming and lottery sales in  we expect sales levels in to be relatively consistent with those reported during however  we continue to pursue additional opportunities in international markets  including those related to ticket printing for the new off premise gaming market for which we launched two products in transact services group revenue from tsg includes sales of consumable products inkjet cartridges  ribbons and paper  replacement parts  maintenance and repair services  refurbished printers and shipping and handling charges 
sales by tsg increased by approximately  or 
change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  domestic   international   domestic tsg revenue increased by approximately  or  to  largely due to higher revenue from maintenance and repair services and refurbished printer sales  offset by a decline in the sale of spare parts  mostly for legacy printers 
international tsg sales increased by approximately  or  to  due primarily to an increase in service revenue 
with the investments we made in  including our new service centers in wallingford  ct and las vegas  nv  as well as the addition of a dedicated direct sales force and a growing installed base of printers  we expect significant sales growth from tsg during gross profit 
gross profit is measured as revenue less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts  direct labor  and the associated overhead expenses 
gross profit decreased by  or  to  and gross margin decreased to from due primarily to lower volume of sales in compared to and a less favorable sales mix 
in addition  gross profit for was negatively impacted by a charge of  or of net sales  related to the write down of inventory and accrual for estimated settlement cancellation payments for non cancelable purchase orders for certain excess inventory components related primarily to our model casino ticket printer 
the charge was largely the result of the faster than expected acceptance of our new epic tm casino ticket printer  which replaces our model casino ticket printer 
we expect gross margin for the first quarter of to be higher than the fourth quarter of due to the higher expected volume of sales in the first quarter 
we expect gross margin for also to be higher than due to the higher expected volume of sales 
engineering and product development 
engineering  design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our engineering staff  depreciation and design expenses including prototype printer expenses  outside design and testing services and supplies 
such expenses increased slightly by  or less than  to  from as we incurred higher expenses related to increased engineering staffing and other employee compensation expenses  which were almost entirely offset by a decrease in costs associated with igt s integration and attainment of jurisdictional approvals for our new epic tm thermal casino printer on all of igt s slot platforms worldwide the igt integration 
we incurred approximately  of igt integration costs in compared to  in engineering and product development expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to from  primarily due to lower sales volume in compared to we expect engineering and product development expenses to increase in as we plan to utilize more contract engineering services to continue increasing product development to expand our product families for the pos market and ticket issuing printers for the gaming market 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff  sales commissions  travel expenses  expenses associated with the lease of sales offices  advertising  trade show expenses and other promotional marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  due primarily to increased expenses related to the addition of new sales staff for our three business units and our new service centers in las vegas  nv and wallingford  ct  marketing  promotional and trade show expenses related to the launch of our new line of printers exclusively for pos distributors and our increased presence at this year s global gaming exposition ge trade show in las vegas  nv  and the recruitment and hiring of a senior vice president of marketing during the second quarter of selling and marketing expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to from  due primarily to the increases noted above in proportion to lower sales volume in compared to we expect selling and marketing expenses to be higher in compared to  as we incur the full year effect of our initiatives 
these initiatives included the formation of our three strategic sales units  the doubling in size of our overall sales force  the addition of a new senior vice president of marketing  and the establishment of two new service centers in las vegas  nv and wallingford  ct 
we believe these investments made in will allow us to achieve our sales growth strategy for and beyond 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our executive  accounting  human resource and information technology staff  expenses for our corporate headquarters  professional and legal expenses  and telecommunication expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  due primarily to recruiting and compensation related expenses associated with the re location of our accounting department from ithaca  ny to wallingford  ct  higher legal expenses related to our lawsuit against futurelogic  inc  and increased software maintenance  travel  training and temporary help expenses associated with our oracle software implementation 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease related to a one time listing fee incurred in resulting from our move back onto the nasdaq national market from the nasdaq smallcap market  lower audit and professional expenses related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of incurred during our second year of compliance compared to our initial year of compliance  and expenses incurred in associated with our proposed acquisition of tpg  inc that was terminated and did not recur in general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales to from  due primarily to the increased expenses noted above in proportion to a lower volume of sales in compared to we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in due primarily to annual increases in compensation expenses  as well as depreciation and other expenses related to our implementation of new oracle software 
business consolidation and restructuring 
we recorded a reversal of expense of  related to the consolidation in this amount was the result of a revision to our original estimate for non cancelable lease payments included in the restructuring accrual 
as of december   we have provided for the estimated remaining non cancelable lease payments and other related costs for this facility through the expiration of the lease march  
we do not expect to incur any further restructuring expenses related to the consolidation 
see consolidation expenses in liquidity and capital resources 
operating income 
during  we reported operating income of  or of net sales  compared to  or of net sales  in the significant decrease in our operating income and operating margin was due largely to lower sales and gross margin  and higher operating expenses primarily selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
interest 
we recorded net interest income of  in compared to net interest income of  in  due to our higher average cash balances and slightly higher interest rates throughout as compared to we do not expect to draw on our revolving borrowings as we expect to continue to generate cash from operations during during  we expect to report increasing net interest income as our cash balance increases throughout the year 
see liquidity and capital resources below for more information 
other expense 
we recorded other income of  in compared to other expense of  in  due primarily to transaction exchange gains recorded by our uk subsidiary in due to the weakening of the british pound against the us dollar as compared to transaction exchange losses recorded in due to the strengthening of the british pound against the us dollar 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of  at an effective rate of during compared to an income tax provision of  at an effective rate of in despite reporting  of income before taxes in  we recorded a net income tax benefit  resulting largely from the recognition of certain discrete tax benefits and tax credits  as well as the reversal of valuation allowances during the year  combined with an unusually low level of income before taxes 
we expect to record income taxes at an effective rate of approximately during net income 
we reported net income in of  or per diluted share compared to net income of  or per diluted share in dividends paid in were approximately  and there will be no dividends or allocation of earnings to preferred shareholders beyond  as the preferred stock was converted to common stock in april all share and per share amounts reflect the april stock split on a retroactive basis 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which requires the recognition of compensation expense for share based compensation including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options and restricted stock over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
although our board of directors accelerated the vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options granted under all our stock plans as of november   we will recognize compensation expense with respect to stock options granted after january  pursuant to fas r

sales of inkjet printers increased by approximately in compared to  as we shipped our bankjet r line of inkjet printers to two top tier financial services companies to upgrade bank teller stations 
we completed almost all shipments related to the upgrade during international pos and banking printer sales decreased by approximately due primarily to sales of our thermal fiscal printer in europe in that did not repeat in we discontinued our thermal fiscal printer in gaming and lottery sales of our gaming and lottery printers increased by  or  from  primarily due to significantly stronger sales of our slot machine and vlt printers  somewhat offset by lower sales of lottery printers to gtech 
change year ended year ended in thousands december  december  domestic   international   sales of our domestic gaming printers  which include vlt and slot machine printers used in racinos  increased from this increase resulted primarily from increased installations of our casino printers  as we benefited from the adoption and rollout of slot machines at casinos throughout north america that print receipts instead of issuing coins

b liquidity and capital resources cash flow overview during  our cash flow was impacted by lower sales volume and net income  the repurchase of outstanding common stock approximately million  the purchase of certain intangible assets from bally gaming  inc bally approximately million and increased investment in new systems  product tooling and our new service center in las vegas  nv approximately million 
however  we finished the year with no outstanding bank debt and million of cash and cash equivalents 
looking forward  we expect to generate approximately to million in cash from operations during we also expect to earn increasing interest income on our available cash balance throughout operating activities the following significant factors primarily affected our cash provided by operations of  in we reported net income of  we recorded depreciation  amortization and non cash compensation expense of  accounts receivable decreased by  due primarily to a lower volume of sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of inventories decreased by  due to lower inventory purchases related to lower sales volume and continued improved inventory management

during  we invested in two significant projects the purchase and implementation of a new oracle erp system including software  hardware and outside consulting fees the implementation of which we expect to complete in approximately  and office renovations to our new gaming and lottery headquarters and western region service center in las vegas  nv approximately 
we believe these projects will provide us with improved efficiency and will enable us to streamline and more cost effectively manage our business as it grows in size  number of locations and overall complexity

as a result of the acquisition  effective july   we are no longer required to pay any future royalties to bally 
the elimination of future royalty payments to bally resulted in a cost savings to the company beginning in the third quarter of we expect our capital expenditures in to be approximately million  largely for the completion of our oracle system implementation  as well as component cost reduction initiatives and our continued focus on product development and the purchase of tooling for new products and enhanced versions of our existing products 
financing activities we used approximately  from financing activities during  largely due to repurchases of company stock approximately  although partly offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan transactions approximately working capital our working capital decreased to  at december  from  at december  the current ratio also decreased to to at december  compared to to at december  the decrease in working capital was largely due to the lower cash balance  resulting largely from our stock repurchases  and lower inventory levels at december  as compared to december  deferred taxes as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately  in order to utilize this deferred tax asset  we will need to generate approximately million of taxable income in future years 
based on future projections of taxable income  we have determined that it is more likely than not that the existing net deferred tax asset will be realized 
credit facility and borrowings on august   we entered into a million credit facility the td banknorth credit facility with td banknorth  na the td banknorth credit facility provides for an million revolving credit line expiring on july   and a million equipment loan facility  which expired in july borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate and are secured by a lien on all the assets of the company

under the conversion  a total  new shares of common stock were issued 
no dividend payments were required beyond the second quarter of shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased by  to  at december  from  at december  the decrease was primarily due to treasury stock purchases of  shares of common stock for approximately  and non cash compensation expense of  related to restricted stock grants and the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding unvested options granted under all our stock incentive plans  offset by net income of  proceeds of approximately  from the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock from stock option exercises and purchases from our employee stock purchase plan  and an increase in additional paid in capital of approximately  resulting from tax benefits from tax deductions arising from the sale of employee stock from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock

these expenses primarily included employee severance and termination related expenses  facility closure and consolidation expenses including moving expenses  estimated non cancelable lease payments and other costs and accelerated depreciation and asset disposal losses on certain leasehold improvements and other fixed assets 
after expanded efforts to sub lease our facility in  we determined that  because of the continuing regional decline in the commercial real estate market during  it was unlikely that we would be able to sublease our wallingford  ct manufacturing facility  which has a lease term that expires in march as a result  during  we increased our restructuring accrual by  to provide for the remaining non cancelable lease payments and related costs associated with the manufacturing facility through the lease expiration date 
in  we revised our estimate of the amount of remaining non cancelable lease payments and related costs associated with the manufacturing facility  which resulted in the reversal of approximately  of accrued restructuring expenses 
no additional restructuring expense was recognized in as of december  and  our restructuring accrual amounted to  and  respectively 
the decrease of  is related solely to payments made on our wallingford  ct facility lease obligation 
we paid approximately   and  of expenses related to the consolidation in  and  respectively 
we continue actively to seek to sublease this facility  and to consider opportunities to modify or exit our existing lease 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these endeavors 
absent our ability to sublease or modify our existing wallingford facility lease  we expect to pay approximately  of these expenses per year in and  and the remaining  in these payments from through relate primarily to lease obligation costs for unused space in our wallingford  ct facility  which terminates march  contractual obligations transact s contractual obligations as of december  were as follows in thousands total years operating lease obligations     purchase obligations    total     purchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements  primarily of raw material and component part inventory

fas r will require compensation cost related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
fas r requires measurement of the cost of share based payment transactions to employees at the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognition of expense over the requisite service or vesting period 
fas r allows for implementation using a modified prospective method  under which compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards and all new awards will be recognized on or after the date of adoption 
fas r also allows companies to adopt fas r by restating previously issued financial statements  basing the amounts on the expense previously calculated and reported in their pro forma footnote disclosures required under fas in april  the fasb changed the implementation date for fas r and the provisions of this statement will now be effective for the company during the first quarter of we are currently reviewing the method of adoption  including the transition method  method of attribution for compensation cost  valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of awards 
currently  we anticipate utilizing the modified prospective application mpa as our transition method 
a company that chooses to utilize the mpa will not restate its prior financial statements 
because the vesting of all existing stock option awards was accelerated on november   we will recognize compensation expense solely for new awards granted after january  the company anticipates allocating expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period and using the short cut method for calculating the pool of windfall tax benefits 
in addition  with regard to valuation methods  the company also anticipates relying exclusively on historical volatility

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the investment of our available cash and cash equivalents 
in accordance with our investment policy  we strive to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital 
an effective increase or decrease of in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the future 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows
