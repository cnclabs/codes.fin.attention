item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview tanox discovers and develops therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to address significant unmet medical needs in the areas of immune mediated diseases  infectious disease  inflammation and cancer 
our products are genetically engineered antibodies that target a specific molecule or antigen 
marketed product xolair xolair was developed in collaboration with genentech  inc genentech and novartis pharma ag novartis 
in the us  xolair is labeled for treatment of adults and adolescents years of age and above with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids 
xolair was approved for use in the us by the fda in june under our collaboration agreements with genentech and novartis  we receive royalties on the net sales of xolair and share in novartis net profits from sales of xolair in the us for the year  we recorded net royalty revenue of million from sales of xolair versus million for the year we recorded net profit sharing of million from novartis for the first three quarters of  as the profit sharing calculation is one quarter in arrears 
this represents the first payments of net profits from us sales of xolair to tanox 
over the next several years  we expect that the net amount we will receive in royalties and profit sharing payments from sales of xolair  taking into account both credits and the amounts payable to our former attorneys  will be in the range of to of net sales  depending on the sales level achieved and geographic distribution of sales 
under the terms of the february  tripartite collaboration agreement tca between tanox  genentech and novartis  tanox relinquished any rights to manufacture xolair and in exchange receives payments based on the quantity of xolair produced 
we recorded our first manufacturing rights revenue of million from genentech and novartis in based on the quantity of xolair produced in the first three quarters of  as the manufacturing rights revenue calculation is one quarter in arrears 
in  we recorded million in net milestone revenue when xolair annual sales achieved million in the us the million gross milestone was reduced by the million due to our former attorneys under an arbitration award 
in october  novartis announced that the european commission had granted marketing authorization in all european union member states for xolair 
xolair was launched by novartis in november in the united kingdom and germany 
in europe  xolair is licensed as add on therapy to improve asthma control in adults and adolescents years of age and above with severe persistent allergic asthma 
as of december   xolair was approved in countries 
clinical trials are ongoing to study the long term safety profile of xolair 
novartis is also currently conducting a phase trial to study the effectiveness of xolair in pediatric allergic asthma patients 
a phase study of xolair in patients with severe peanut allergy was discontinued by genentech  novartis and tanox in january after pre study oral food challenges resulted in severe hypersensitivity in two individuals 
the decision to discontinue the trial was not related to the safety of xolair  since neither of the patients had received xolair as they had not been enrolled in the study 
genentech  novartis and tanox are working with food allergy experts and patient advocacy groups to determine a path forward before discussing alternative plans with the fda 

table of contents clinical development programs we currently have two products in clinical development 
tnx our lead clinical product is tnx  a potential treatment for hiv aids 
in october  we reported that the tnx phase study met its primary endpoint with tnx plus an obr demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in viral load the level of detectable hiv in the bloodstream compared to placebo plus obr at weeks 
tnx was well tolerated  with no serious adverse events related to the drug 
the phase trial is scheduled to complete its week duration in april subject to a satisfactory end of phase meeting with the fda  we intend to move forward with a late stage clinical study in tnx tnx is an anti tissue factor chimeric antibody for the treatment of acute lung injury ali and acute respiratory distress syndrome ards 
we are conducting a phase trial with tnx designed to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics of the antibody 
the trial is a single blinded  dose escalating  placebo controlled trial  which is expected to complete enrollment of its third cohort by the end of preclinical programs we filed an ind application for tnx in december  as a potential treatment for hodgkin s lymphoma 
tnx is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin il which has been shown to be elevated in the bloodstream of patients with hodgkin s disease 
we anticipate initiating a phase study in we also believe that il could play a role in other cancers and inflammatory disease  and we are conducting additional pre clinical tests for such indications  including tnx as a potential treatment for inflammatory disease 
we intend to file a second ind for tnx in for an inflammatory disease indication 
other products in preclinical development are tnx  a tissue factor antagonist program as a potential treatment for cancer  tnx  a humanized monoclonal antibody being developed as a potential treatment of both dry and wet age related macular degeneration amd and tnx  a humanized monoclonal antibody being developed as a potential treatment for osteoporosis 
manufacturing and other programs re commissioning activities at our manufacturing facility in san diego  california continued to advance throughout scale up of the production process for clinical trial material is under way for late stage development of tnx critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto 
actual results may differ from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition under our collaboration agreements with genentech and novartis  we receive a royalty on the net sales of xolair worldwide and share in novartis net profits from xolair sales in the us royalty revenue is recorded monthly based on contractual terms and information provided by genentech and novartis 
royalties are reconciled and adjusted if actual results differ from those previously reported to us and are subject to audit by tanox 
profit sharing is calculated and recorded one quarter in arrears 
manufacturing rights revenue represents amounts received from genentech and novartis in consideration of our relinquishment  under the collaboration agreements  of our rights to manufacture xolair 
manufacturing rights revenue is based on the quantity of xolair produced and is calculated and recorded one quarter in arrears 
revenues from development agreements include payments for milestone achievements and sponsored research and development costs 
milestone payments are received under best efforts contracts and are not refundable 
they are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved and there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenues for sponsored research and development are recognized as revenue as we complete our obligations related to such activities 
any revenue contingent upon future performance is deferred and recognized as the performance is completed 
revenues recognized are net of certain credits and amounts due to our former attorneys under an arbitration award 
research and development research and development expenses consist of direct costs and indirect overhead costs  including facilities costs  salaries  related benefit costs and material and supply costs 
expenses may also include upfront fees and milestone payments paid to licensors and collaborative partners 
such amounts are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs also include estimates for clinical trial costs  which are based on patient enrollment and clinical trial progress 
actual costs may differ from estimates 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards or fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the revision is referred to as fas r share based payment or fas r  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb and will require companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments including stock options and stock issued under employee stock plans 
tanox will adopt fas r using the modified prospective basis on january  the adoption of fas r is expected to result in compensation expense that will reduce diluted net income per share by approximately to per share for the actual stock compensation expense will dependent on the number of options granted  employee turnover and the volatility of our stock price

acquired in process research and development 
on march   we acquired a tissue factor antagonist program for the potential treatment of ali ards from sunol 
in addition to ali ards  the anti tissue factor monoclonal antibodies acquired from sunol have the potential to treat cancer and other diseases that result from over expression of tissue factor and related coagulation abnormalities 
we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and paid million in cash for the program  resulting in a fair value of million 
of the shares issued   shares will be held in escrow for up to three years after the closing of the transaction to secure indemnification obligations under the asset purchase agreement 
as of the acquisition date  the acquired program was still in early stage development and had not reached technological feasibility 
we determined that no alternative future use existed for this program  and  accordingly  the million acquisition price was recorded as acquired in process research and development expense 
general and administrative expenses 
for the years ended december   and  the cost associated with general and administrative activities were for the year ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and did not change significantly

there was no provision for income taxes in  or  due to pre tax losses of million  million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   we received a refund related to alternative minimum taxes paid in and which we recorded as a credit benefit to our income tax provision 
net loss 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million  or net loss per share  compared to a net loss of million or net loss per share for same period in the increase in net loss in was due primarily to the acquired in process research and development expense for the purchase of the tissue factor antagonist program  re commissioning costs associated with our san diego manufacturing facility and the increase in other research and development expenses 
this was partially offset by increased revenue associated with xolair 
the net loss increased to million in or net loss per share  as compared to million or net loss per share in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through sales of equity securities  development and licensing fee revenues  interest income  equipment financing agreements and  beginning in  royalty revenue from xolair sales 
during the year ended december   we sold approximately million shares of common stock in an initial public offering for net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  of which million were classified as current assets 
cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased by million for the year ended december  to million from million at december  the net decrease in funds was primarily due to the acquisition of the manufacturing assets from biogen idec  the acquisition of acquired in process research and development materials and intellectual property rights  the repayment of the note payable to a bank and the funding of operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the use of cash was comprised mainly of a net loss of million  an increase in receivables related to the xolair milestone  and other assets of million  offset by acquired in process research and development of million

pursuant to a lease assignment and asset purchase agreement dated december   between biogen idec and tanox  on january   we acquired from biogen idec certain manufacturing  process development and qc equipment  related documentation and furniture and fixtures housed in a  square foot leased facility located in san diego  california 
we paid biogen idec approximately million for the assets 
tanox finalized the allocation of the purchase price in the second quarter of and classified million as property  plant and equipment and the remaining million as an intangible asset for manufacturing equipment documentation  included in other assets on the balance sheet 
we also agreed to assume the obligations of biogen idec under the triple net lease for the facility  which extends until september  the lease has two five year extension options and escalating lease payments of approximately 
as partial consideration for our agreement to the extension of the lease term to september   biogen idec agreed to make two payments to us  each in the amount of million  on september  and november  we expect the total lease obligation of tanox for this lease assignment through  net of the biogen idec payments  will be approximately million 
on march   we acquired a tissue factor antagonist program for the potential treatment of ali ards from sunol 
in addition to ali ards  we believe the anti tissue factor monoclonal antibodies acquired from sunol have the potential to treat cancer and other diseases that result from over expression of tissue factor and related coagulation abnormalities 
in consideration for the tissue factor antagonist program  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and paid million in cash to sunol 
of the shares issued   shares will be held in escrow by sunol for up to three years after the closing of the transaction to secure indemnification obligations under the asset purchase agreement 
as part of the program  we received all tissue factor antagonist assets of sunol  including anti tissue factor monoclonal antibodies and related technologies and intellectual property  as well as non exclusive rights to certain technologies and related intellectual property for protein and antibody expression 
based upon the closing price of our common stock on march   the fair value of the acquired assets was million  including the million paid in cash 
as of the acquisition date  the acquired program was still in early development stage  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  we recorded the million acquisition price as an acquired in process research and development expense for the year ended december  in the second quarter of  tanox biotech shanghai  ltd tanox shanghai was established as a wholly owned subsidiary of tanox pharma international to carry out research projects and collaborate with academic research institutes in china 
in may  tanox shanghai entered into an agreement with the institute of health science in shanghai  china  to establish a joint research laboratory 
tanox and a third party manufacturer began discussions in the fourth quarter of related to revisions to a manufacturing and supply agreement because we determined that we would produce tnx for phase clinical trials in the newly leased san diego manufacturing facility 
in february  a letter agreement with the third party manufacturer was reached to suspend all provisions of the manufacturing and supply agreement for a period to be determined by us  but not to exceed months 
under the terms of the letter agreement  tanox paid a total of million  of which  represented a cancellation fee and the remaining  may be credited against future work performed by the third party manufacturer  subject to certain limitations 
we plan to resume production of tnx under the manufacturing and supply agreement on or before august  
table of contents on february   tanox  genentech and novartis entered into a tripartite collaboration agreement tca to settle all then outstanding litigation and arbitrations among the parties and to finalize the detailed terms of the three party collaboration  begun in  to develop and commercialize certain anti ige antibodies  including xolair and tnx under the terms of the three party collaboration agreement  genentech and novartis each reimbursed tanox million for a portion of its tnx development costs  and tanox relinquished any rights to manufacture xolair in exchange for the right to receive payments tied to the quantity of xolair produced 
the first manufacturing rights payment was received in the third quarter of we were engaged in litigation in connection with a fee dispute with the law firms that represented us in litigation with genentech relating to  among other things  the intellectual property rights surrounding the development of anti ige technology 
in  an arbitration panel issued an award entitling the attorneys to receive approximately million  including interest  payments ranging from to of the future milestone payments  in excess of the first million  we would receive from genentech following product approval  and of the royalties that we would receive on all sales of certain anti ige products  including xolair 
during the appeals process  we were required to place amounts in escrow to secure payment of the award  and had escrowed million with the harris county district court as of december  these funds were released to the former attorneys in february the payment due to the attorneys in the amount of of the royalties we receive on xolair sales is required to be paid within days of the end of each calendar quarter in which the royalty payments are received by tanox 
in september  we entered into a million revolving line of credit note agreement loc agreement with a bank 
under the terms of the agreement  we could secure advances up to the aggregate principal amount of million  the proceeds of which could be used to finance the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
the outstanding principal balance was payable in full on september   and advances bear interest at the lesser of the prime rate or libor  the london interbank offered rate  plus 
accrued interest is payable on the last day of each month 
we repaid million outstanding under the loc agreement and terminated the agreement on december  the company has alternative sources of capital at more favorable terms and determined not to replace or renegotiate the credit agreement at this time 
the following table represents tanox s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases purchase obligations total our current and anticipated development projects require substantial additional capital to complete 
we do not expect to generate positive cash flow from operations until at least because we anticipate that the amount of cash we need to fund operations  including research and development  manufacturing and other costs  and for capital expenditures  will increase in the future as our projects move from research to clinical development to commercialization 
we may make additional acquisitions of businesses or intellectual property assets and also expect that we will need to expand our clinical development  manufacturing capacity  facilities  business development and marketing activities to support the future development of our programs 
based on cash projections  we expect that cash on hand and revenue from operations will be sufficient to fund our existing operations for at least the next four years 
however  our future capital needs will depend on many factors  including the continued successful commercialization of xolair  progress in our research and product development activities  the size and 
table of contents design of our clinical trials  commercialization activities  the costs and magnitude of product or technology acquisitions  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or terminations of existing collaboration and licensing arrangements  establishing additional collaboration and licensing arrangements  potential merger and acquisition activities  potential litigation surrounding any of the foregoing  and manufacturing scale up costs and marketing activities  if we undertake those activities 
consequently  we may need to raise additional funds and we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity securities 
we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec in may  which would permit us to sell up to million of equity or debt securities in one or more offerings 
we expect to use the net proceeds from sales of securities under this shelf registration statement to provide additional funding for development of products in our drug development pipeline  potential product acquisition or licensing opportunities and general corporate purposes 
the terms of any offering of securities will be made public in a subsequent filing with the sec at the time of any such sale 
pursuant to the terms of a registration rights agreement entered into with sunol in connection with the acquisition of the tissue factor antagonist program  we filed a registration statement with the sec in may covering the resale of up to  shares of our common stock by sunol and its shareholders to whom a portion of those shares have been distributed
