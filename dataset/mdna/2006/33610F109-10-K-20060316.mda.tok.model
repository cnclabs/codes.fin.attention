total assets at december  were million compared to million at december  critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated and combined financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap that require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require subjective or complex judgments and are the policies and estimates that the company deems most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations 
it is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  including evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  impairment of long lived assets and purchase accounting for acquisitions of real estate 
the following section is a summary of certain aspects of these critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition rental income under leases with scheduled rent increases or rent abatement is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the leases 
accrued straight line rents included in the company s consolidated balance sheets represents the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over cash received under applicable lease provisions 
the company s leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of incurred property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized on the date of termination when the related leases are canceled and the company has no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
the company must make estimates related to the collectibility of its accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  tenant reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income because a higher required allowance for doubtful accounts receivable will result in lower net income 
investments in real estate and real estate entities investments in real estate are recorded at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life  increase capacity  or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows buildings years building improvements to years tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the terms of the related leases furniture  fixtures  and equipment to years the company reviews market conditions for possible impairment of a property s carrying value 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions or changes in management s intended holding period indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  an impairment analysis is performed 
the company assesses the recoverability based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
this estimate is based on projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly used by appraisers 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of its investments in real estate 
the company will classify a building as held for sale when the sale of the building is probable and will be completed within one year and that actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that a sale will be withdrawn 
accordingly  the company classifies assets as held for sale when our board of trustees has made the decision to dispose of the building  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed under which the buyer has committed a significant amount of nonrefundable cash and no significant financing contingencies exist which could cause the transaction not to be completed in a timely manner 
if these criteria are met  the company will record an impairment loss if the fair value reduced by selling costs is lower than the carrying amount of the building  and we will cease incurring depreciation 
the company will classify the impairment loss  together with the building s operating results  as discontinued operations on its statement of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet 
interest expense is reclassified to discontinued operations only to the extent the property to be disposed of secures specific mortgage debt 
purchase accounting the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with purchase accounting adjustments recorded related to rental properties and additional interests acquired in real estate entities acquired 
ownership interests acquired from related  common owners are accounted for at their historical cost basis 
acquisitions of ownership interests and rental property of other parties are accounted for at fair value 
for purchases of rental property and additional interests that were consummated subsequent to june   the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  the fair value of the real estate acquired was determined on an as if vacant basis 
that value is allocated between land and building based on management s estimate of the fair value of those components for each type of property and to tenant improvements based on the net carrying value of the tenant improvements  which approximates their fair value 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the tangible assets on an as if vacant basis was allocated as follows origination value of leases based on the unamortized capitalized leasing costs at the date of the acquisition  which approximates the market value of the lease origination costs had the in place leases been originated on the date of acquisition  the value of above and below market in place leases based on the present values using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual rent amounts and market rents over the remaining non cancelable lease terms  ranging from one to eleven years  the intangible value of tenant or customer relationships  and the value of in place leases represents absorption costs for the estimated lease up period in which vacancy and foregone revenue are incurred 
the company s determination of these values requires it to estimate market rents for each of the leases and make certain other assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the rental revenue  depreciation expense and amortization expense it recognizes for these leases and associated intangible assets and liabilities

while the company believes net income available to common shareholders as defined by gaap is the most appropriate measure of operating results  management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental measure given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts 
ffo  reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions  principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  which assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on sales of real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with nareit s definition  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo  or similarly titled measures  used by other companies and this may not be comparable to those presentations 
ffo should not be viewed as a substitute to net income as a measure of the company s operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company s properties  which are significant economic costs that could materially impact the company s results of operations 
the following table presents a reconciliation of net income to ffo for the years ended december  and respectively 
the company has not presented ffo for since it does not consider full year operating results indicative of results subsequent to its initial public offering and therefore not a meaningful supplemental performance measure
