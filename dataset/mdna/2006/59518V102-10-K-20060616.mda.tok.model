this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in part i  item a risk factors above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market both implantable and disposable medical devices used in the treatment of cerebral vascular diseases 
we also are developing products for the treatment of ischemic disease and have recently launched our first product in this market 
our products are used by interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons to treat cerebral aneurysms responsible for hemorrhagic stroke 
both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke are significant causes of death worldwide 
our product lines consist of endovascular systems that enable a physician to gain access to the brain in a minimally invasive manner through the vessels of the arterial system 
we believe our products provide a safe and reliable alternative to more invasive neurosurgical procedures for treating aneurysms 
our proprietary three dimensional  embolic coils are unique in that they automatically and rapidly deploy within an aneurysm  forming a scaffold that conforms to a wide diversity of aneurysm shapes and sizes 
we also supply accessory devices and products including microcatheters and guidewires used to deliver microcoils and stents for the treatment of cerebral vascular disease 
we plan on growing our business by continuing to penetrate our existing markets  bringing new products and technologies to interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons  and by entering new markets such as asia where we introduced our products in japan through a distributor 
our products commenced selling in japan in march our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our microcoils 
we also sell access devices  which currently do not account for a significant portion of our revenues 
geographically  our revenues are generally from sales to customers in the americas  europe and asia 
our products are shipped from our facilities in the united states  switzerland  united kingdom  and a logistics facility in the netherlands  to either hospitals or distributors 
we invoice our customers upon shipment 
in select hospitals  our products are held on consignment  free of charge and remain on site 

table of contents we anticipate that our cost of goods sold will generally increase in absolute dollars during those quarters in which our sales increase or we incur additional manufacturing costs in anticipation of the commercial introduction of new products 
furthermore  our gross margin percentage may decrease in those quarters in which we initiate sales of new products or product lines  or enter new geographic territories 
our product development efforts are primarily focused on expanding our current line of microcoils and broadening our product offerings 
in august  we introduced our cerecyte microcoil product line and since june we have launched seven new products  including microcoils  stents  microcatheters and guidewires 
we intend to continue this product line expansion with the goal of continuing to increase our per procedure revenue 
we also intend to continue to expand our direct sales force in europe and the united states and enter the asian markets through distributors 
in march  we launched our sales and marketing efforts in japan through our distribution partner goodman 
we recorded product sales of million to goodman in march as we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as described below  we currently anticipate that the broadening of our product line  the worldwide expansion of our direct sales force and our entry into the asian market will be primarily funded with our currently available cash 
we introduced our first proprietary  three dimensional microcoil in may our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal since inception  we have been unprofitable 
we have incurred net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we believe that our current cash position and the cash expected to be generated from product sales will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we expand our manufacturing and sales activities and expand geographically 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
recent developments expanded manufacturing facility 
on june   we signed a new lease for expanded facilities which will allow us to further increase our manufacturing capacity 
we believe this additional capacity will allow us to meet the anticipated demand for our products and improve manufacturing efficiencies 
initial public offering 
on june   we completed an initial public offering ipo in which we sold  shares of common stock at per share for net cash proceeds of approximately million

in april  we paid an additional million for the first year earn out payment 
after the purchase of neurologic  we formed a new wholly owned subsidiary in the uk and changed the name from neurologic to micrus endovascular uk ltd micrus endovascular uk 
we concurrently entered into long term services agreements with each of the two founders of neurologic to provide for their employment by micrus endovascular uk 
in addition  the two founders of neurologic agreed to a non competition provision to last for a period of six years  under which they may not actively carry on any business that would compete with neurologic s business within the uk or ireland 
similarly  they have agreed not to solicit former clients  customers or suppliers of neurologic for a period of three years

under the terms of our agreement  we paid an upfront licensing fee of approximately million to biotronik and were required to make milestone payments to biotronik upon receipt of approvals to market stent products we jointly developed for the treatment of neurovascular disease and royalty payments on the products sold 
in february  biotronik received ce mark clearance for the pharos stent intended for both the treatment of aneurysms and the treatment of ischemic diseases 
as a consequence we paid milestone payments to biotronik of approximately million in both march and april we will make royalty payments to biotronik when we start selling the pharos stent in the first quarter of fiscal under the terms of this agreement  there are no future milestone payments to biotronik related to the pharos stent

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations  expressed as percentages of revenues  for the years ended march   and year ended march  consolidated statement of operations data revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest and investment income interest expense other income  net net loss before provision for income taxes benefit from income taxes net loss accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock to redemption value including beneficial conversion feature net loss attributable to common stockholders fiscal years ended march  and revenues our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our microcoils and to a lesser extent sales of accessory devices used in the treatment of cerebral vascular diseases 
our revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from million in fiscal revenues from the americas were in fiscal  an increase of million or from million in fiscal revenues from europe were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of microcoil products sold during this period 
factors driving the increase included growth in the overall market for embolic coils  an increase in our share of both the domestic and foreign markets in which we participate and the introduction of new products 
additionally  the increase in revenues was partially due to higher average selling prices as a result of increased cerecyte product sales in fiscal our revenues in fiscal also included initial sales to our distributor in japan of million which has been included in the company s european geographic segment 
gross profit cost of goods sold consists of materials  direct labor  overhead costs associated with manufacturing  impairments of inventory and warranty expenses 
cost of goods sold were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold during 
table of contents fiscal as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in personnel and manufacturing costs associated with increased sales of our products as well as increased costs attributable to a general increase in salaries  benefits and overhead costs resulting from increased production  partially offset by increased manufacturing efficiencies 
cost of goods sold in fiscal included a  impairment of inventory related to design changes to further enhance the handling and performance of the product and a  impairment of inventory related to products determined to be excess inventories 
gross profit was million in fiscal  an increase of million or from million in fiscal gross margin was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from sales of higher margin products and manufacturing efficiencies  partially offset by the increase in cost of goods sold of  due to higher per unit cost of inventory acquired in connection with the purchase of neurologic that was sold from the acquisition date through the end of fiscal and import handling fees of  associated with product shipments through our prior distributor in japan 
we expect our gross margin to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of our product sales 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the design  development  and testing of new and existing products 
such costs are expensed as they are incurred and include salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to outside consultants  and other direct and indirect costs related to research and product development 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to expenses in connection with the purchase of intellectual property ip from vascular fx amounting to million  an increase of  related to evaluating in process technology  an increase of million  in the form of an upfront licensing fee in connection with the biotronik agreement  an increase of million related to increased headcount  as well as an increase of  in supplies expense and  in consulting expense associated with the developing and testing of new products 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal excluding the non routine charges related primarily to the acquisition of ip from vascular fx  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional development personnel  continue work on product improvements  and expand our existing product line 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation costs of our direct sales force and marketing personnel  as well as overhead costs related to these activities 
also included are costs associated with promotional literature and videos  trade show participation  and education and training of physicians

as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal due to an increase in headcount both in the united states and europe in the sales force and clinical support group 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase the size of our direct sales force and clinical support group  increase spending on additional sales and marketing programs and expand into additional geographic territories 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for finance  human resources  facilities  information technology  insurance  and professional services 
professional services are principally comprised of outside legal  audit and information technology consulting 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of 
table of contents million or from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a stock based compensation charge in fiscal relating to our former ceo of million  a decrease in audit and tax fees of million as our general and administrative expenses in fiscal year included audit and other fees related to the preparation for our ipo and for international tax restructuring and planning  and the monetary penalty of  pursuant to the agreement we entered into with the doj in february  partially offset by increases of million related to higher finance and administrative personnel costs   related to the amortization of identifiable intangible assets in connection with the purchase of neurologic   due to higher insurance premiums for our directors and officers insurance policy associated with being a public company   related to management bonuses in connection with our ipo   associated with investor relations costs and board of directors fees  and  for regulatory costs associated with entering the japanese market

stock based compensation charges deferred compensation for stock options granted to employees has been calculated as the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees during fiscal  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million 
we recorded these amounts as a component of stockholders equity and are amortizing the amount  on a straight line basis  as a non cash charge to cost of goods sold and operating expenses over the vesting period of the options 
exercise prices of options granted subsequent to march  were determined to be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the resulting amortization expense of the deferred stock based compensation for the grant of stock options to employees was  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
we anticipate we will record amortization of deferred compensation related to these employee stock option grants as follows fiscal year fiscal year the compensation expense will be reduced in the period of forfeiture for any accrued but unvested compensation arising from early termination of an option holder s services 
in addition to the amounts outlined above  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we will record compensation expense for the value of stock options vesting from that date forward in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r 
in addition  stock options issued to non employees  generally for consulting services related to patient studies or marketing analysis  are recorded at their fair value on the date of vesting in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf no 
and recognized over the respective service or vesting period 
in connection with stock options issued to non employees  we recorded  and  of stock based compensation expense in fiscal and  respectively 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of investment income  interest expense  and foreign currency gains and losses 
total other income  net was million in fiscal  an increase of  from  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income of million primarily as a result of higher interest rates and higher average cash and investment balances 
this was partially offset by higher foreign exchange losses of million resulting from differences in exchange rates between the time of the recording of the transaction and settlement of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables  and a non operating charge of  recorded upon the completion of our ipo for the change in fair value of the common stock warrants 

table of contents income taxes we have incurred net operating losses for both federal and state purposes since inception and  as a result  we have paid no federal or state income taxes 
in fiscal  we accrued a current tax benefit of approximately  arising from a net operating loss attributed to neurologic for the period after the acquisition date and a noncurrent tax benefit of approximately  for the tax effect of the current year amortization related to the intangible assets acquired in the neurologic transaction which are not deductible 
as of march   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards nols that are available to reduce future taxable income of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the federal nols will expire at various dates beginning in  state nols will expire beginning in and the foreign nols will expire beginning in we also have federal and state tax research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in the state tax credit carryforwards do not expire 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration  we have established a valuation allowance at march  and to fully offset the deferred tax assets 
accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock to redemption value our convertible preferred stock that was outstanding prior to the closing of our initial public offering in june was redeemable at the request of the holder on or after the sixth anniversary of the original issuance date based upon certain circumstances 
this right expired upon the automatic conversion of all of our preferred stock into common stock upon the closing of the ipo 
prior to the closing of the ipo  we were accreting the carrying value of the preferred stock to the mandatory redemption amount on the sixth anniversary using the effective interest method through periodic charges to additional paid in capital 
we recorded a non cash charge of  and million for the accretion on our redeemable convertible preferred stock in fiscal and  respectively 
beneficial conversion feature the difference between the proceeds allocated to the series e preferred stock and the estimated fair value of the common stock issuable upon conversion resulted in a beneficial conversion feature on the series e preferred stock which was recorded as a reduction to the series e preferred stock and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the total beneficial conversion feature was  which  prior to the completion of the ipo  was being amortized as a reduction of net income available to common stockholders over the period of redemption of the series e preferred stock 
upon completion of the ipo  we recorded a non cash charge of  for the beneficial conversion feature on our series e preferred stock in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal years ended march  and revenues our revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of microcoils shipped by us during this period 
factors driving this increase included growth in the overall market for embolic coils  an increase in our share of both the domestic and foreign markets in which we participate and the launch of our cerecyte microcoil product line in august in addition  million of our increase in revenues resulted from the decline in the us dollar against the foreign currencies in which our international revenues are denominated

additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in doing so  we have to make estimates and assumptions that 
table of contents affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates  which we discuss below 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our accounting advisors  audit committee and board of directors 
although our significant policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and product warranty 
we generate revenues from the sale of our microcoil product line and related equipment and accessories 
revenues are generated from sales to hospitals and third party distributors 
revenues are recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized generally upon shipment  after the receipt of a replenishment or purchase order 
the evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a contract or a purchase order approved by the customer 
delivery to the customer occurs when the customer takes title to the product 
generally title passes upon shipment  but may occur when the product is received by the customer based on the terms of the agreement with the customer 
the selling price for all sales are fixed and agreed with the customer prior to shipment and are generally based on established list prices or contractual agreements 
we perform a credit check on new customers and periodic credit checks on existing customers 
accordingly  collectibility is generally assured prior to shipment 
in the event a sale is made to a customer for which collectibility is not reasonably assured  we either require prepayment of the order or revenue is deferred and recognized upon collection 
we maintain a reserve for amounts which may not be collectible 
as of march  our accounts receivable reserve was  sales made to our south american distributors are made according to the same contractual terms as sales made to other customers 
however  we have historically experienced longer delays in receiving payments and a higher level of write offs relating to our south american distributors and have been unable to conclude that collectibility is reasonably assured at the time that the customer takes title to the inventory on sales to this class of customers 
accordingly  for this class of customers  we recognize revenues when cash is collected 
revenues recognized from these customers was million  million  and million for the years ended march    and  respectively 
the cost of goods sold is deferred as a component of finished goods inventory and recognized at the time the related sale is recognized 
we maintain inventory at various hospital locations under the custody of hospital personnel for use in procedures 
we recognize revenues on sales to these customers when the revenue criteria have been met  which occurs when the hospital customer informs us that product has been removed from inventory and used in a procedure 
once a sale has occurred  we provide our customers with limited warranty privileges 
to date  product returns under warranty have not been significant 

table of contents sales to distributors are recognized at the time of shipment  provided the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable fees received from distributors upon entering into multi year distribution agreements  where there is no culmination of a separate earnings process  are deferred and amortized over the term of the distribution agreement or the expected period of performance  whichever is longer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
we record allowances in the period when the revenues are recognized based on anticipated future events 
if there are unanticipated future events  this allowance may need to be adjusted 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our products have a three year shelf life  with the exception of our cerecyte microcoils  which have a two year shelf life 
our products are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative products 
our inventory  which consists primarily of microcoils  is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
the inventory reserve at march  was million  which included a million impairment of inventory for our microcoils in our consignment accounts and finished goods inventory which after review of historical turnover  future demand and market conditions for our product were determined to be excess inventories  and a  impairment of inventory for obsolescence of product due to expiration or anticipated expiration of shelf life 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional reserves based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding expense to cost of goods sold 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of march  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits 
stock based compensation 
we have granted to our employees options to purchase our common stock at exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock  as determined by our board of directors on the date of grant 
in anticipation of our ipo  we determined that for financial reporting purposes the estimated value of our common stock was in excess of the exercise price for certain option grants occurring in the fiscal year ended march  we record the deferred compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced for any cancellation of unvested options 
for the years ended march   and  we recorded employee stock based compensation expense of   and  respectively 
no deferred compensation has been recognized on grants occurring prior to june  and subsequent to march  as we determined that the exercise price for these grants was equal to or greater than the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 
we anticipate that nearly all stock options granted in the future will have no difference between the exercise price and the deemed value of the underlying shares because the vast majority of stock options will have an exercise price determined by the trading price in the market on the date of grant 
deferred compensation  net of forfeitures recorded from stock option grants through march  totaled approximately million 
these valuations are inherently highly uncertain and subjective 
if we had made different assumptions  our deferred stock based compensation amount  our stock based compensation expense  our net loss and net loss per share could have been significantly different 

table of contents under generally accepted accounting principles  companies are permitted to use an alternative method of valuing stock options which is based on the fair value of the stock option on the date of grant 
this method generally results in the recording of a greater expense related to stock options 
recent changes to the accounting rules require all companies to use a fair value method to record compensation expense related to stock options 
we are required to adopt this change in the first quarter of fiscal as of march   the intrinsic value of outstanding employee stock options  based on the closing price of per share  was as follows vested million unvested million recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaced sfas no 
and superseded apb no 
sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
under sfas no 
r  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb no 
but will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning in the company s first quarter of fiscal as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method of apb no 
and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of the fair value method of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on the results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
while sfas no 
r permits entities to continue the use of the black scholes option pricing model  sfas no 
r also permits the use of a binomial model 
based on the research done by the company on the alternative models available to value option grants  and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options the company expects to issue in the future  the company has determined that it will continue to use the black scholes option pricing model for stock option valuation upon the adoption of sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency market risks 
historically  we have been exposed to risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates due to intercompany loans made to micrus sa  our swiss subsidiary  in in connection with its incorporation 
these loans are denominated in swiss francs and will fluctuate in value against the us dollar  causing us to recognize foreign exchange gains and losses 
the functional currency of our swiss subsidiary is the swiss franc 
the functional currency of our uk subsidiary is the pound sterling 
in europe  our revenues are denominated in swiss francs  euros  pounds sterling and other currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to market risk related to changes between the swiss franc and these other currencies 
if the swiss franc appreciates against the currencies in which our receivables are denominated  we will recognize foreign currency losses 
for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  the financial results of our swiss subsidiary are translated into us dollars based on average exchange rates during the applicable period 
a hypothetical decline in the value of the swiss franc versus the us dollar would cause us to recognize a loss of  related to our loan with micrus sa and a  decrease in our comprehensive loss from our investment in micrus sa 
a hypothetical decline in the value of the pound sterling versus the us dollar would cause us to recognize a  increase in our comprehensive loss from our investment in micrus uk 
a hypothetical decline in the value of the euro versus the swiss franc would cause us to recognize a loss of  based on our foreign denominated receivables as of march  in fiscal  approximately of our revenues was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
in future periods  we believe a greater portion of our revenues could be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  thereby increasing our exposure to exchange rate gains and losses on non us currency transactions 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we believe our currency exposure merits  we may consider entering into transactions to help mitigate that risk 
interest rate market risk 
our cash is invested in bank deposits and money market funds denominated in us dollars 
the carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates fair market value 
our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk  which is the risk that our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates
