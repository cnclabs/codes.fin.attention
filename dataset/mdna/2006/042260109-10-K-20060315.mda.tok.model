centigon tm was created from the recognized brand names of o gara hess eisenhardt armoring company tm  armor mobile security france formerly labbe tm  and armor mobile security germany formerly trasco tm 
the commercial vehicle armoring process requires the complete disassembly of a new base vehicle 
this disassembly can involve the removal of the dash  interior trim  seats  doors an d windows 
the passenger compartment then is armored with both opaque and transparent armor ballistic glass 
other features  such as run flat tires and anti explosive fuel tanks  may also be added 
finally  the vehicle is reassembled to as close to its original appearance as possible 
the entire conversion process results in a low profile  integrated ballistic protective system 
our relationship with various vehicle manufacturers such as jaguar and land rover has been valuable in allowing us to offer our customers certain vehicles which maintain the original warranties issued by the vehicle manufacturer 
we produce fully armored vehicles as well as light armored vehicles 
we also offer armor piercing and blast protection for specific vehicles by enhancing th e ballistic system  and underbody protection with proprietary materials  and installation methods that protect the occupants against a defined threat 
we produce a new ie defense system tm that we believe represents a unique multiple threat armor solution for certain commercially available sport utility vehicles suvs 
it is intended to protect the vehicle s occupants against an improvised explosive devices ied attack and a subsequent attack by an assault rifle with armor piercing bullets 
as these attacks have become more frequent in iraq and afghanistan  we believe an increasing number of government officials  private contractors  non government organizations ngos  private individuals and others are in need of such protection 
we believe the launch of our new ie defense system underscores the centigon tm commitment to leading technology and responding to the threats faced around the world  as well as our efforts to integrate technology insights across our family of businesses 
fully armored vehicles also include head of state cars which are formal limousines used predominantly for official functions by a president or other head of state

customers aerospace defense group 
in  our aerospace defense group sold approximately of its products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
sales of aerospace defense group products to all branches of the united states military and its prime contractors such as am general  oshkosh  textron marine land  boeing  sikorsky aircraft and stewart stevenson represented approximately of the aerospace defense group s revenue 
the aerospace defense group s businesses have relied to a great extent on relatively few major customers  although saw the development of additional major users of aerospace defense group products within their existing customer base eg other users within the eg military 
we believe that historical customers  such as the us army and other branches of the us military  to whom we have supplied products for approximately years  will continue to be major customers 
current commercial and licensing customers include boeing  bell helicopter  textron marine land  ppg industries  intercast europe  and avon rubber company 
the loss of or significant reduction in sales to a major customer could potentially have a material adverse effect o n our business  operations and financial condition 
the aerospace defense group is focused on increasing its share of the total revenue in the international market in the demand from foreign militaries for the same equipment us military forces use in iraq and afghanistan has significantly increased 
the market for military hardware products is worldwide in scope  including the us military and foreign defense forces 
the primary contract for delivery of up armored hmmwvs is with the us military  although smaller quantities are also sold to foreign governments 
the primary contracts for the armor kit programs are with the us military 
foreign interest and demand for our products has increased thereby adding a new dimension to our market 
we added a new director for international military programs in mid to address this interest 
products group 
in  the products group sold approximately of its products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
the primary end users of the products group s products are federal  state and local law enforcement agencies  local police departments  state corrections facilities  us and allied militaries  highway patrols and sheriffs departments 
the products group s security products are marketed through an extensive network of approximately domestic distributors and international agents  and through a sales force of approximately representatives and specialists under brand names that are well established in the military and law enforcement communities 
our gregory r brand of products are sold primarily in north america and such sales represent approximately of gregory sales 
mobile security division 
in  the mobile security division sold approximately of its products in north america  with the balance sold internationally 
the mobile security division s armored commercial vehicle customers include governmental and private buyers who purchase both fully and light armored vehicles 
governmental buyers and foreign royalty are also customers for parade cars 
typically  governmental buyers consist of ministries of foreign affairs  defense and internal affairs and offices of presidential security 
these customers are generally not constrained in their purchasing decisions by considerations such as import duties and taxes and are free to search globally for the best product available 
the procurement cycles of governmental buyers can range from relatively rapid  when the vehicles are for the use of the head of state or in response to a particular crisis  to prolonge d highly documented bids and evaluations for normally budgeted items 
private customers for armored commercial vehicles include corporations and individuals 
private buyers tend to be more price sensitive and will often purchase locally manufactured vehicles to reduce taxes and avoid import duties 
local servicing of the vehicle is also a critical concern to private buyers 
customers for cash in transit vehicles are generally companies that provide cash in transit services to financial institutions 
purchasing decisions for cash in transit vehicles depend on many criteria including insurance  regulatory requirements and costs  and whether the financial institution is private or governmental 
approximately of our revenues were from our ten largest customers for the year ended december  fiscal 
approximately of our revenues came from us military contracts 
our aerospace defense group s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of aerospace defense grou p revenues for fiscal the products group s ten largest customers accounted for approximately of total revenues of the products group for fiscal the mobile security division s ten largest customers accounted for approximatel y of total revenues of the mobile security division for fiscal military and governmental contracts generally are awarded on a periodic or sporadic basis 
if the aerospace defense group were to lose either the m up armored hmmwv contract  which continues through june  or additional orders for the next generation versions known as the m and m up armored hmmwvs  our financial performance would experience a material adverse effect 
marketing and distribution aerospace defense group 
most of the aerospace defense group s products are distributed as a component supplier to the original equipment manufacturers oems or as a direct contractor to the us government 
the products are built to order 
we do not directly serve mass consumer markets and supply directly from manufacturing facilities 
thus  the distribution of the aerospace defense group s products does not involve significant inventory  warehousing or shipping methodologies 
depending upon the product  we typically employ one of four methods for marketing i direct sales  ii technical teams  typically comprised of a combination of sales personnel and engineers  iii strategic alliances with oems and us government prime contractors  and iv responses to formal reques t for proposals in bidding for government contracts 
in marketing our safety restraint and seating products  we endeavor to maintain close relationships with existing customers and to establish new customer relationships 
ongoing relationships and repeat customers are an important source of business for our current and new products 
our marketing and sales activities in the government sector focus primarily upo n identifying research and development and other contract opportunities with various agencies of the united states government or with others acting as prime contractors on government projects 
key members of our engineering and project management staffs work to maintain close working relationships with representatives of the united states military and their prime contractors 
through these relationships  we seek to monitor needs  trends  and opportunitie s within current military product lines 
the aerospace defense group emphasizes its ability to develop new products  o r product adaptations  quickly and more cost effectively than traditional defense contractors 
in marketing its products to the military  the aerospace defense group places strong emphasis on its superior antitank and antipersonnel mine protection for the occupants of tactical wheeled vehicles 
we market our military products through a combination of trade show exhibits  print advertising in military related periodicals and direct customer visits 
we emphasize the cross marketing of military and commercial products  which we believe strengthens the image of each product group 
we have also entered into exclusive teaming and joint marketing agreements with various prime contractors in connection with the up armored hmmwv  up armoring for himars and family of medium tactical vehicles fmtv for sales in domestic and international military  heavy tactical vehicles and commercial areas 
such agreements are designed to allow us to benefit from the prime contractor s marketing network and save on certain selling costs 
additionally  the aerospace defense group focuses on the individual warrior soldier  marine  seaman  and airman 
this focus area for the company encompasses those programs where products are worn or carried by the individual which increase their survivability and mobility 
current major programs include the otv  molle  sapi and the ach 
we seek to take a proactive approach in addressing the needs of the department of defense in this area through active corporate involvement in the new equipment training net programs  participation in events which focus on the individual warrior  and having a close working relationship with the program executive office peo for individual equipage

kevlar r is a patented product of ei du pont de nemour s co  inc du pont and is only available from du pont and its european licensee 
we purchase twaron  spectrashield r  and dyneema r fibers directly from the manufacturers  and from weaving companies who convert the raw fibers into ballistic fabric 
we believe that we enjoy a good working relationship wit h these suppliers 
however  if necessary  we believe that we could readily find replacement weavers 
we also use spectrashield r  dyneema r and kevlar r in our hard and vehicle armor products 
additionally  we use polycarbonates  acrylics  ballistic quality steel  aluminum  ceramics  and ballistic glass 
wit h the exception of ceramics  we are aware of multiple suppliers for these materials and would not anticipate a significant impact if we were to lose any suppliers 
we purchase other raw materials used in the manufacture of our various products from a variety of sources and additional sources of supply of these materials are readily available

the market for our aerospace defense group s products and services are highly competitive 
numerous suppliers compete for government defense contracts as prime contractors or subcontractors 
competitio n relates primarily to technical know how  cost  and marketing efforts 
the competition for government contracts relates primarily to the award of contract s for the development of proposed products 
contracts for supply of products primarily tends to follow the development contracts because of the extensive investment necessary to develop and qualify new products 
our military product lines in armor  parachutes  crash resistant military seating and flotation collars have a number of competitors  with none dominating the market 
our competitive strategy is to be a technology innovator and strategic partner to first tier suppliers and oems 
our present or future products could be rendered obsolete by technological advances by one or more of our competitors or by future entrants into our markets 
there are a large number of companies that provide specific armoring packages for tactical wheeled vehicles  helicopters and selected other military applications 
products group 
the market for our law enforcement products is highly competitive and we compete with competitors ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations 
for example  in the body armor business  we compete by providing superior design  engineering and production expertise in our line of fully integrated ballistic and blast protective wear 
our principal competitors in this market niche include several domestic and international competitors on a region by region basis 
in the less lethal product industry  w e compete by providing a broad variety of less lethal products with unique features and formulations  which  we believe  afford us a competitive advantage over our competitors 
the principal competitive factors for all of our products are quality of engineering and design  reputation in the industry  production capability and capacity  price and ability to meet delivery schedules 
mobile security division 
the market for the mobile security division s product s and services is highly competitive 
we compete in a variety of markets and geographic regions  with competitors ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations 
we believe that our design  engineering and production expertise in providing fully integrated ballistic and blast protecte d vehicles gives us a competitive advantage over those competitors who provide protection against only selected ballistic threats 
a number of vehicle armorers in europe  the middle east and latin america armor primarily locally manufactured automobiles 
in the us and in latin america  w e have a variety of different competitors 
in the high end luxury sedan market we compete with oems  as well as a variety of small independent automotive integrators 
the principal competitive factors are ballistic protection  price  quality of engineering and design  production capability and capacity  ability to meet delivery schedules and reputation in the industry 
given the nature of some of our competitors  who are larger and better capitalized than us  our failure to compete effectively or our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition 
employees as of january   we have a total of approximately  employees  of which approximately  were employed in the aerospace defense group  approximately  in the products group  approximately in the mobile security division  and approximately in our corporate headquarters and information technology operation 
research and development we view our research and development efforts as critical to maintaining a leadership position in the security products and vehicle armoring markets 
we believe the continuously evolving threats of today demand the advancement and application of state of the art technology to ensure proper protection of our customers 
our research and development occurs primarily under fixed price or cost plus  government funded contracts as well as company sponsored efforts 
we seek to offer superior quality and advanced products and systems to our customers at competitive prices 
to achieve this objective  we engage in ongoin g engineering  research and development activities to improve the reliability  performance and cost effectiveness of our existing products 
we also design and develop new products in an ongoing effort to anticipate and meet our customers evolving needs 
we expect to continue to focus on complete system integration t o provide unique finished products to our customers 
in addition  we will seek to strengthen our position in the area of core materials and technology that offer superior performance when designed into those products 
we believe a distinct advantage comes from the leveraged synergy across all security products from armor materials in helmets  vests  aircraft and vehicles to energy absorbing seats in helicopters and landmine resistant trucks 
in order to fully realize the benefits of synergy across our divisions  businesses and products  we have a centrally managed research and development function at the corporate level 
we seek to employ engineers and scientists wit h expertise in materials  aerospace  mechanical  electrical  automotive and other engineering disciplines 
to maximize efficiency  we utilize important relationships with outside testing laboratories  universities  companies and often times our key clients 
research and development costs include salaries and benefits of research and development personnel  testing and certification  and other research and development related costs 
research and development costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses as incurred and for fiscal  and  approximated million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to incur research and development costs of million to million in fiscal we recorded revenue of million  millio n and million from government funded research and development in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect an additional million to million o f research and development costs to be government funded in fiscal patents and trademarks we currently own numerous united states and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications for inventions relating to our product lines as well as several united states and foreign registered and unregistered trademarks relating to our products and services

we also have an exclusive license to use the mace r trademark in the law enforcement market and a non exclusive license to use the flex cuf r trademark 
although we do not believe that our ability to compete in any of our product markets is dependent solely on our patents and trademarks  we do believ e that the protection afforded by our intellectual property provides us with important technological and marketing advantages over our competitors 
although we have protected our technologies to the extent that we believe appropriate  the measures taken to protect our proprietary rights may not deter or prevent unauthorized use of our technologies 
damage from any such failures could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition 
in other countries  our proprietary rights may not be protected to the same extent as in the united states 
government regulation we are subject to federal licensing requirements with respect to the sale of some of our products in foreign countries 
in addition  we are obligated to comply with a variety of federal  state and local regulations  both domesticall y and abroad  governing certain aspects of our operations and workplace  includin g regulations promulgated by  among others  the us departments of commerce  state and transportation  the federal aviation administration  the us environmental protection agency and the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms 
the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco  and firearms also regulate our manufacturing of certain destructive devices and the use of ethyl alcohol in certain products 
we also ship hazardous goods  and in doing so  must comply with the regulations of the us department of transportation for packaging and labeling 
additionally  the failure to obtain applicable governmental approval and clearances could adversely affect our ability to continue to service the government contracts we maintain 
furthermore  we have material contracts with governmental entities and are subject to rules  regulations and approvals applicable to government contractors 
we are also subject to routine audits to assure our compliance with these requirements 
we have become aware that we wer e not in full compliance with certain regulations governing the export of equipment and related technology used for military purposes that are applicable to some of our products 
we are currently in compliance with such regulations and have undertaken steps to help ensure we remain in compliance in the future 
we do not believe that such noncompliance will have a material adverse effect o n our business 
in addition  a number of our employees involved with certain of our federal government contracts are required to obtain and maintain specified levels of security clearances 
our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances that are needed to perform service s contracted for the department of defense  one of our major customers 
our failure to comply with these contract terms  rules or regulations could expose us to substantial penalties  including the loss of these contracts and disqualification as a us government contractor 
like other companies operating internationally  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other laws which prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by us and other business entities 
we operate in countries known to experience endemic corruption 
our extensive operations in such countries create the risk of an unauthorized payment by one of our employees or agents which would be in violation of various laws includin g the fcpa 
violations of the fcpa may result in severe criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  given our strict codes of conduct and ethics  coupled with the penalties imposed for a violation  we believe we are  and endeavor to remain  in compliance 
environmental laws and regulations we are subject to federal  state  and local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and human health  including those regulating discharges to the air and water  the management of wastes  and the control of noise and odors 
while we always strive to operate in compliance wit h these requirements  we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all such requirements 
we are subject to potentially significan t fines or penalties if we fail to comply with environmental requirements and we do not currently carry insurance for such noncompliance events 
although we hav e made and will continue to make capital expenditures in order to comply with environmental requirements  we do not expect material capital expenditures for environmental controls in however  environmental requirements are complex change frequently  and could become more stringent in the future 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that these requirements will not change in a manner that will require material capital or operating expenditures or will otherwise have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
we are also subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination 
we may be subject to liability  including liability for cleanup costs  if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former facilities  in some circumstances even if such contamination was caused by a third party such as a prior owner 
we also may be subject to liability if contamination is discovered at a landfill or other location where we have disposed of wastes  notwithstanding that our historic disposal practices may have been in accordance with all applicable requirements the amount of such liability could be material and we do not currently carry insurance for such environmental cleanups should they be required of us 
we use orthochlorabenzalmalononitrile and chloroacetophenone chemical agents in connection with our production of tear gas  and these chemicals are hazardous and could cause environmental damage if not handled and disposed of properly 
simula s principal environmental focus is the handling an d disposal of paints  solvents  and related materials in connection with product finishes  welding  and composite fabrication

risk factors in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our busines s because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently consider to be immaterial  may also impact ou r business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our securities could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our industry the products we sell are inherently risky and could give rise to product liability and other claims 
the products that we manufacture are typically used in applications and situations that involve high levels of risk of personal injury 
failure to use our products for their intended purposes  failure to use or care for them properly  or their malfunction  or  in some limited circumstances  even correct use of our products  could result in serious bodily injury or death 
given this potential risk of injury  proper maintenance of our products is critical 
our products include vehicle and hard armoring systems  rotary and fixed wing aircraft seating systems  parachutes  military helmets  body armor and plates designed to protect against ballistic and sharp instrument penetration  less lethal products such as less lethal munitions  pepper sprays  distraction devices and flameless expulsion grenades  various models of police batons  and police duty gear 
claims have been made and are pending against certain of our subsidiaries  involving permanent physical injury and death caused by self defense sprays and other munitions intended to be less lethal 
in addition  the manufacture and sale of certain less lethal products may be the subject of product liability claims arising from the design  manufacture or sale of such goods 
if these claims are decided against us and we are found to be liable  we may be required to pay substantial damages and our insurance costs may increase significantly a s a result which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
also  a significant or extended lawsuit  such as a class action  could also divert significant amounts of management s time and attention 
we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover the payment of any potential claim 
in addition  we cannot assure you that this or any other insurance coverage will continue to be available or  if available  that we will be able to obtain it at a reasonable cost 
our cost of obtaining insurance coverage has risen substantially since september  any material uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the inability to obtain product liability coverage would prohibit us from bidding for orders from certain governmental customers since  at present  many bids from governmental entities require such coverage  and any such inability would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
in april   two class action lawsuits were filed against us in florida stat e court by police organizations and individual police officers  alleging that ballistic resistant soft body armor vests containing zylon r  manufactured and sold by american body armor tm  safariland r and protech r  failed to meet the warranties provided with the vests 
on november   the jacksonville  florida duval county circuit court gave final approval to a settlement reached with the sspba which provided that i purchasers of certain zylon r containing vest models could exchange their vests for other vests manufactured by the company and ii the company would continue its internal used vest testing program vestcheck tm 
the other class action suit filed by napo  in ft 
myers  florida lee county  was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice on november  on august   the united states department of justice  nij  released its third nij report 
the third nij report contained  among other items  informatio n and testing data on zylon r and zylon r containing vests  and substantially modified compliance standards for all ballistic resistant vests with the implementation of the nij interim requirements for ballistic resistant bod y armor 
as a result of the actions of the nij  the company halted all sales or shipment of any zylon r containing vest models effective august   and immediately established a supplemental relief renamed the zve program that provides either a cash or voucher option to those who purchased any zylon r containing vests from us through august  the zve program  wit h the consent of the sspba  was given final approval by the jacksonville  florida court on october  we are also voluntarily cooperating with a request for documents and data received from the department of justice  which is reviewing the entire body armor industry s use of zylon r  and a subpoena served by the general services administration for information relating to zylon r 
any adverse resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  and our failure or inability to comply with these regulations could materially restrict our operations and subject us to substantial penalties 
we are subject to federal licensing requirements with respect to the sale in foreign countries of certain of our products 
in addition  we are obligated to comply with a variety of federal  state and local regulations  both domesticall y and abroad  governing certain aspects of our operations and workplace  includin g regulations promulgated by  among others  the us departments of commerce  state and transportation  the federal aviation administration  the us environmental protection agency and the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms 
the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco  and firearms also regulates us a s a result of our manufacturing of certain destructive devices and by the use of ethyl alcohol in certain products 
we also ship hazardous goods  and in doing so  must comply with the regulations of the us department of transportation for packaging and labeling 
additionally  the failure to obtain applicable governmental approval and clearances could materially adversely affect our ability to continue to service the government contracts we maintain 
furthermore  we have material contracts with governmental entities and are subject to rules  regulations and approvals applicable to government contractors 
we are also subject to routine audits to assure our compliance wit h these requirements 
we have become aware that we are not in full compliance wit h certain regulations governing the export of equipment and related technology used for military purposes that are applicable to certain of our products 
we have made a voluntary disclosure to the office of defense trade controls compliance and have undertaken steps to comply with these regulations and to help ensure compliance in the future 
we do not believe that such noncompliance will have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  a number of our employees involved with certain of our federal government contracts are required to obtain specified levels of security clearances 
our business may suffer if we or our employees are unable to obtain the security clearances that are needed to perform services contracted for the us department of defense  one of our major customers 
our failure to comply with these contract terms  rules or regulations could expose us to substantial penalties  including the loss of these contracts and disqualification as a us government contractor 
like other companies operating internationally  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act and other laws which prohibit improper payments to foreig n governments and their officials by us and other business entities 
we operate in countries known to experience endemic corruption 
our extensive operations i n such countries create risk of an unauthorized payment by one of our employees o r agents  which would be in violation of various laws including the foreign corrupt practices act 
violations of the foreign corrupt practices act may result in severe criminal penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we have significant international operations and assets  and therefore  are subject to additional financial and regulatory risks 
we sell our products in foreign countries and seek to increase our level of international business activity 
our overseas operations are subject to various risks  including us imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries which could prohibit sales of our products there  foreign import controls which may be arbitrarily imposed and enforced and which could interrupt our supplies or prohibit customers from purchasing our products  exchange rate fluctuations  dividend remittance restrictions  expropriation of assets  war  civil uprisings and riots  government instability  the necessity of obtaining government approvals for both new and continuing operations  and legal systems of decrees  laws  taxes  regulations  interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied 
one component of our strategy is to expand our operations into selected international markets 
military procurement  for example  has traditionally had a large international base 
we actively market our products in europe  north an d south america  the middle east  africa  and asia 
we  however  may be unable to execute our business model in these markets or new markets 
further  foreign providers of competing products and services may have a substantial advantage over us in attracting consumers and businesses in their country due to earlier established businesses in that country  greater knowledge with respect to the cultural differences of consumers and businesses residing in that country and o r their focus on a single market 
we expect to continue to experience higher cost s as a percentage of revenues in connection with the development and maintenance of international products and services 
in pursuing our international expansion strategy  we face several additional risks  including o foreign laws and regulations  which may vary country by country  that may impact how we conduct our business  o higher costs of doing business in foreign countries  including different employment laws  o potential adverse tax consequences if taxing authorities in different jurisdictions worldwide disagree with our interpretation of various tax laws or our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions  which could result in our paying additional taxes  interest and penalties  o technological differences that vary by marketplace  which we may not be able to support  o longer payment cycles and foreign currency fluctuations  o economic downturns  and o revenue growth outside of the united states may not continue at the same rate if it is determined that we have already launched our products and services in the most significant markets 
we may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes  excise duties  import taxes  export taxes or other governmental assessments 
in addition  a percentag e of the payments to us in our international markets are often in local currencies 
although most of these currencies are presently convertible into us dollars  we cannot be sure that convertibility will continue 
even if currencies are convertible  the rate at which they convert is subject to substantial fluctuation 
our ability to transfer currencies into or out of loca l currencies may be restricted or limited 
any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs  which could reduce revenue or profits and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition results of operations and liquidity 
we routinely operate in areas where local government policies regarding foreign entities and the local tax and legal regimes are often uncertain  poorly administered and in a state of flux 
we cannot  therefore  be certain that we are in compliance with  or will be protected by  all relevant local laws and taxes at any given point in time 
a subsequent determination that we failed to comply with relevant local laws and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
one or more of these factors could adversely affect our future international operations and  consequently  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operation and liquidity 
risks related to our business many of our customers have fluctuating budgets  which may cause substantial fluctuations in our results of operations 
customers for our products include federal  state  municipal  foreign and military  law enforcement and other governmental agencies 
government tax revenues and budgetary constraints  which fluctuate from time to time  can affect budgetary allocations for these customers 
many domestic and foreign government agencies have in the past experienced budget deficits that have led to decreased spending in defense  law enforcement and other military and security areas 
our results of operations may be subject to substantial period to period fluctuations because of these and other factors affecting military  law enforcement and other governmental spending 
a reduction of funding for federal  state  municipal  foreign and other governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on sales of our products and our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  us military business would have a material adverse effect on us 
us military contracts account for a significant portion of our business 
the us military funds these contracts in annual increments 
these contracts require subsequent authorization and appropriation that may not occur or that may be greater than or less than the total amount of the contract 
changes in the us military s budget  spending allocations and the timing of such spendin g could adversely affect our ability to receive future contracts 
none of our contracts with the us military has a minimum purchase commitment  and the u 
s military generally has the right to cancel its contracts unilaterally without prior notice 
we are the sole source provider to the us military for the armo r and blast protection systems up armoring for their hmmwvs 
the hmmwvs are manufactured by am general corporation under separate us military contracts 
should production or deliveries of hmmwvs be significantly interrupted  or should other single source suppliers significantly interrupt deliveries of our components for up armoring the hmmwvs  we will not be able to deliver such up armoring systems for the hmmwvs to the us military on schedule  which coul d have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we also manufacture for the us military helicopter seating systems  aircraft and land vehicle armor systems  protective equipment for military personnel and other technologies used to protect soldiers in a variety of life threatening or catastrophic situations 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in  us military business for our aircraft and land vehicle armor systems  other protective equipment  or helicopter seating system s could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
a reduction of us force levels in iraq may affect our results of operations 
since the invasion of iraq by the us and other forces in march  we have received steadily increasing orders from the us military for the up armoring of hmmwvs and the armoring of other tactical trucks as well as orders for personnel equipment  including sapi and other engineered ceramic body armor  helmets  and other protective and duty equipment 
orders for the up armoring of hmmwvs and the armoring of other tactical trucks as well as orders for personne l equipment are the result  in significant part  from the particular combat situations encountered by the us military in iraq  including the use of ieds by enemy combatants 
we cannot be certain  therefore  to what degree the us military would continue placing armoring orders for its hmmwvs and other tactical trucks as well as orders for personnel equipment  if the us military were to reduce its force levels or withdraw completely from iraq 
a significant reduction in orders from the us military for the armoring of hmmwvs and other tactical trucks as well as orders for personnel equipment  following a reductio n of us force levels in iraq could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
a replacement of the hmmwv in the us military may affect our results of operations 
there continues to be new orders under our current m up armored hmmwv contract and additional orders for the next generation versions known as the m and m up armored hmmwvs 
while backlog extends into for both the m and m up armored hmmwv versions  there are plans for procurement of a replacement military light transport vehicle which is currently in the early development stage 
while current acquisition strategies plan for possible production of new light and medium support vehicles beginning as early as  there is no assurance as to when a replacement for the hmmwv may be selected  and  furthermore  it is reasonable to believe that the hmmwv may continue for some time to be one of the primary transport vehicles in the us military 
in the event the hmmwv is replaced  based on us military procurement plans  it i s anticipated that vehicle armoring for a replacement vehicle would be provided t o the vehicle s oem for inclusion in the manufacturing process 
we anticipate tha t procurements for the potential hmmwv replacement models would be competitive an d could be awarded to multiple armor suppliers based on full and open competition although we anticipate continuation of developmental efforts and enhancement of manufacturing capabilities  at this time  there is no certainty of obtaining armoring contracts for any hmmwv replacement vehicles selected by the us military  and  if successful in competitive programs  we cannot determine the specific levels of effort likely under such military contracts 
additionally  with regard to the introduction of potential hmmwv replacement vehicles  the us military recently announced the us government s preference to own the technical data rights for new major end items of equipment and sub systems  including the vehicle armoring packages 
the us government s intent to mitigate risk of limitations on producibility and to ensure commonality of armor components produced by multiple sources may negatively influence future manufacturing content and product pricing  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we may lose money or generate less than expected profits on our fixed price contracts 
some of our government contracts provide for a predetermined  fixed price for the products we make regardless of the costs we incur 
therefore  fixed price contracts require us to price our contracts by forecasting our expenditures 
when making proposals for fixed price contracts  we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for completing these projects 
these estimates reflect management s judgments regarding our capability to complete projects efficientl y and timely 
our production costs may  however  exceed forecasts due to unanticipated delays or increased cost of materials  components  labor  capital equipment or other factors 
therefore  we may incur losses on fixed price contracts that we had expected to be profitable  or such contracts may be less profitable than expected  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our business is subject to various laws and regulations favoring the us government s contractual position  and our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our operating results and prospects 
as a contractor to the us government  we must comply with laws and regulation s relating to the formation  administration and performance of the federal government contracts that affect how we do business with our clients and may impose added costs on our business 
these rules generally favor the us government s contractual position 
for example  these regulations and laws include provisions that subject contracts we have been awarded to o protest or challenge by unsuccessful bidders  and o unilateral termination  reduction or modification by the government 
the accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the us government under both cost plus and fixed price contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the defense contract audit agency  an arm of the us department of defense 
responding to governmental audits  inquiries or investigations may involve significant expense and divert management s attention 
our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract termination  suspension or debarment from contracting with the federal government  civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution and penalties  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
our markets are highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively we will be adversely affected 
the markets in which we operate include a large number of competitors ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations and are highly competitive 
competitors who are larger  better financed and better known than we are may compete more effectively than we can 
in order to stay competitive in our industry  we must keep pace with changing technologies and client preferences 
if we are unable to differentiate our services from those of our competitors  our revenues may decline 
in addition  our competitors have established relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address client needs 
as a result  new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and compete more effectively than we can 
there is also a significant industry trend towards consolidation  which may result in the emergence of companies which are better able to compete against us 
any such development could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operation and liquidity 
there are limited sources for some of our raw materials  which may significantl y curtail our manufacturing operations 
the raw materials that we use in manufacturing ballistic resistant garments  sapi plates and armored vehicles include ceramic  steel  spectrashield  a patented product of honeywell  inc  kevlar r  a patented product of ei du pont de nemours co  inc du pont  and twaron  a patented product of teijin we purchase these materials in the form of woven cloth from five independent weaving companies 
in the event du pont or its licensee in europe cease  for an y reason  to produce or sell kevlar r to us  we would utilize these other ballistic resistant materials as a substitute 
however  neither spectrashield nor twaron  is expected to become a complete substitute for kevlar r in the near future 
we enjoy a good relationship with our suppliers of kevlar r  spectrashield and twaron 
should these materials become unavailable for any reason  we would be unable to replace them with materials of like weight and strength 
we use a variety of ceramic materials in the production of sapi plate s and a variety of steels in armoring vehicles 
although we have a number of suppliers that we deal with in obtaining both ceramic and steel supplies  the industry generally  including our operations  is experiencing a limited supply of certain of these materials  which is affecting the quantity of product that we can complete in any given period 
in addition  spectrashield  the ballistic fiber backing used in a variety of our ballistic applications  including sapi plates  is currently being rationed by the us department of commerce  which could limit the quantity of sapi plates that we produce in any given period 
thus  if our supply of any of these materials were materially reduced or cut of f or if there was a material increase in the prices of these materials  our manufacturing operations could be adversely affected and our costs increased  and our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity coul d be materially adversely affected 
we may be unable to complete or integrate acquisitions effectively  if at all  and as a result may incur unanticipated costs or liabilities or operational difficulties 
we intend to grow through the acquisition of businesses and assets that will complement our current businesses 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets  obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms or successfully acquire identified targets 
furthermore  we may have to divert our management s attention and our financial and other resources from other areas of our business 
our inability to implement our acquisition strategy successfully may hinder the expansion of our business 
because we depend in part on acquiring new businesses and assets to develop and offer new products  failure to implement our acquisition strategy may also adversely affect our ability to offer new products in line with industry trends we may not be successful in integrating businesses acquired in the future or those recently acquired into our existing operations 
integration may result in unanticipated liabilities or unforeseen operational difficulties  which may be material or require a disproportionate amount of management s attention which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
future acquisitions may result in us incurring additional indebtedness or issuing preferred stock or additional common stock 
competition for acquisition opportunities in the industry may rise  thereby increasing our cost of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions 
in addition  the terms and conditions of our senior credit facility  senior subordinated convertible notes due november  the convertible notes and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes due the notes impose restrictions on us that  among other things  restrict our ability to make acquisitions and adversely affect our ability to execute our execute acquisition strategy 
our resources may be insufficient to manage the demands imposed by our growth 
we have rapidly expanded our operations  and this growth has placed significant demands on our management  administrative  operating and financial resources 
the continued growth of our customer base  the types of services and products offered and the geographic markets served can be expected to continue to place a significant strain on our resources 
in addition  we cannot easily identify and hire personnel qualified both in the provision and marketing of our products an d systems 
our future performance and profitability will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain additional management and other key personnel our ability to implement successful enhancements to our management  accounting and information technology systems  and our ability to adapt those systems  as necessary  to respond to growth in our business 
we are dependent on industry relationships 
a number of our products are components in our customers final products 
accordingly  to gain market acceptance  we must demonstrate that our products will provide advantages to the manufacturers of final products  including increasing the safety of their products  providing such manufacturers with competitive advantages or assisting such manufacturers in complying with existing or new government regulations affecting their products 
there can be n o assurance that our products will be able to achieve any of these advantages for the products of our customers 
furthermore  even if we are able to demonstrate such advantages  there can be no assurance that such manufacturers will elect t o incorporate our products into their final products  or if they do  that our products will be able to meet such customers manufacturing requirements 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our relationships with our manufacturer customers will ultimately lead to volume orders for our products 
the failure of manufacturers to incorporate our products into their final products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology  including the technologies we use to furnish the up armoring of hmmwvs 
we depend upon a variety of methods and techniques that we regard as proprietar y trade secrets 
we also depend upon a variety of trademarks  service marks and designs to promote brand name development and recognition 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright  patent  trademark  unfair competition and other intellectual property laws as well as contractual agreements to protect our rights to such intellectual property 
due to the difficulty of monitoring unauthorized use of and access to intellectual property  however  such measures may not provide adequate protection 
it is possible that our competitors may access our intellectual property and proprietary information an d use it to their advantage 
in addition  there can be no assurance that courts will always uphold our intellectual property rights  or enforce the contractual arrangements that we have entered into to protect our proprietary technology 
any unenforceability or misappropriation of our intellectual property could hav e a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that any pending patent application or trademark application made by us will result in an issued patent or registered trademark  or that  if a patent is issued  it will provide meaningful protection against competitors or competitor technologies 
in addition  if we bring or become subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of our rights or of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of our intellectual property rights  such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources  which could have a materia l adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unfavorable results in such litigation could also result in the loss or compromise of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties on unfavorable terms  or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
technological advances  the introduction of new products  and new design and manufacturing techniques could adversely affect our operations unless we are able to adapt to the resulting change in conditions 
our future success and competitive position depend to a significant extent upon our proprietary technology 
we must make significant investments to continue to develop and refine our technologies 
we will be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to the conduct of continuing researc h and development activities  the engagement of additional engineering and other technical personnel  the purchase of advanced design  production and test equipment  and the enhancement of design and manufacturing processes and techniques 
our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to provide design and manufacturing services for new products that compare favorably on the basis of time to introduction  cost and performance with the design and manufacturing capabilities 
the success of new design and manufacturing services depends on various factors  including utilization of advances in technology  innovative development of new solutions for customer products  efficient and cost effective services  timely completion and delivery of new product solutions and market acceptance of customers end products 
because of the complexity of our products  we may experience delays from time to time in completing the design and manufacture of new product solutions 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any new product solution s will receive or maintain customer or market acceptance 
if we are unable to design and manufacture solutions for new products of our customers on a timely and cost effective basis  such inability could have a material adverse effect o n our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
we may be adversely affected by applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and human health  including those regulating discharges to the air and water  the management of wastes  and the control of noise and odors 
we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all such requirements 
like all companies in our industry  we are subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with environmental requirements 
environmental requirements are complex  change frequently  and could become more stringent in the future 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that these requirements will not change in a manner that will require material capital or operating expenditures or will otherwise have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
in addition  we are also subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and clean up of environmental contamination 
we may be subject to liability  including liability for clean up costs  if contamination is discovered at one of our current or former facilities  in some circumstances even if such contamination was caused by a third party such as a prior owner 
we also may be subject to liability if contamination is discovered at a landfill or other location where we have disposed of wastes  notwithstanding that historic disposal practices ma y have been in accordance with all applicable requirements 
we use orthochlorabenzalmalononitrile and chloroacetophenone chemical agents in connection with our production of tear gas  and these chemicals are hazardous and could cause environmental damage if not handled and disposed of properly 
moreover  private parties may bring claims against us based on alleged adverse health impacts or property damage caused by our operations 
the amount of liability for cleaning up contamination or defending against private party claims could be material and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
risks related to ownership of our common stock delaware law may limit possible takeovers 
our certificate of incorporation makes us subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the general corporation law of the state of delaware 
in general  section prohibits publicly held delaware corporations to which it applies from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
this provision could discourage others from bidding for our shares and could  as a result  reduce th e likelihood of an increase in our stock price that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors will be authorized to issue from time to time  without further stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix or alte r the designations  preferences  rights and any qualifications  limitations or restrictions of the shares of each series  including the dividend rights  dividend rates  conversion rights  voting rights  terms of redemption  includin g sinking fund provisions  redemption price or prices  liquidation preferences an d the number of shares constituting any series or designations of any series 
suc h shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
we may issue additional preferred stock in ways which may delay  defer or prevent a change in control of us without further action by our stockholders 
such shares of preferred stock may be issued with voting rights that may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock by increasing the number of outstanding shares having voting rights  and by the creation of class or series voting rights 
the market price for our common stock is volatile 
the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile 
we believe that a variety of factors  including announcements by us or our competitors  current events such as the war in iraq  quarterly variations in financial results  trading volume  general market trends and other factors  could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
additionally  due to our relatively modest size  our winning or losing a large contract may have the effect of distorting our overall financial results 
we may issue a substantial amount of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions  and the sale of those shares could adversely affect our stock price 
as part of our acquisition strategy  we anticipate issuing additional shares of common stock as consideration for such acquisitions 
to the extent that we are able to grow through acquisitions and issue shares of our common stock as consideration  the number of outstanding shares of common stock that will be eligible for sale in the future is likely to increase substantially 
persons receiving shares of our common stock in connection with these acquisitions may be more likely to sell large quantities of their common stock that may influenc e the price of our common stock 
in addition  the potential issuance of additiona l shares in connection with anticipated acquisitions could lessen demand for our common stock and result in a lower price than would otherwise be obtained 
our stock price may be adversely affected when additional shares are sold 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate and may require us to issue greater amounts of our common stock to finance future acquisitions 
additional shares sold to finance acquisitions may dilute our earnings per share if the ne w operations earnings are disappointing 
our debt agreements restrict our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders 
our debt agreements  such as the indenture governing the convertible notes  the indenture governing the notes and the senior credit facility  contain certain financial and other covenants that limit  under certain circumstances  our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders 
w e are permitted to pay dividends and make other distributions to stockholders to the extent we satisfy the conditions  including the financial and other covenants  contained in such documents 
we have million of total debt short term  current portion and long term as of december  our million of total debt as of december   could have important consequences to you and to us 
for example o no payment of any kind may be made to our common stockholders without first meeting our obligations under our senior credit facility  the indenture governing our notes and the indenture governing our convertible notes  o we may become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industr y conditions and adverse changes in governmental regulations  o we may have to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments required under our senior credit facility the notes and the convertible notes  reducing the availability of cash flow to fund future capital expenditures  workin g capital  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs and other general corporate requirements  o we may have limited flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have less deb t or more financial resources  o we may have limited ability to borrow additional funds  even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity  and o the terms of our senior credit facility  the indentures governing the notes and convertible notes allow us to incur substantial amounts of additional debt  subject to certain limitations 
we might incur additional debt for various reasons  including to pay for additional acquisitions that we may make and assuming debt of companies that we may acquire  including new senior credit facilities associated with our pending acquisition of stewart stevenson services  inc item b

kroll  inc matters o gara hess eisenhardt armoring do brasil ltda 
ohe brazil was assessed million reals us million based on the exchange rate as of december  plus interest and penalties by the brazilian tax authorities 
ohe brazil has appealed the tax assessments and the cases are pending 
to the exten t that there may be any liability resulting from such assessments  we believe tha t we are entitled to indemnification from kroll  inc for up to million unde r the terms of our purchase agreement dated april   because the events in question with respect to up to million of such assessments occurred prior to our purchase of the o gara companies from kroll  inc in and prior to our acquisition of oheac in  several of the former employees of kroll o gara company de mexico  sa de sa o gara mexico  a subsidiary of oheac  commenced labor claims against o gara mexico seeking damages for unjustified termination 
in late  the principal labor claim wa s settled by us for approximately million and two of the remaining claims were settled for approximately  kroll  inc indemnified us  subject to a  deductible  with respect to these settlement payments 
in december  o gara hess eisenhardt france sa  which was acquired from kroll  inc ohe france in august  sold its industrial bodywork busines s operated under the name labbe division de o gara hess eisenhardt france carrosserie industriells carrosserie to snc labbe 
subsequent to the sale  the labbe family trust lft  owner of the leasehold interest upon which the carrosserie business is operated  sued ohe france and snc labbe claiming that the transfer of the leasehold was not valid because lft had not given its consent to the transfer as required under the terms of the lease 
lft sought to have ohe france  as the sole tenant  maintain and repair the leased building with an estimated cost of between us and us million  based on the exchange rate as of december  the case is currently pending  and while we are contesting the allegations vigorously  we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
although we do not have any insurance coverage for this matter  at this time  we do not believe this matter will have a material impact on our financial position  operations or liquidity 
zylon r in april   two class action lawsuits were filed against us in florida stat e court by police organizations and individual police officers  alleging that ballistic resistant soft body armor vests containing zylon r  manufactured and sold by american body armor tm  safariland r and protech r  failed to meet the warranties provided with the vests 
on november   the jacksonville  florida duval county circuit court gave final approval to a settlement reached with the sspba which provided that i purchasers of certain zylon r containing vest models could exchange their vests for other vests manufactured by the company and  ii the company would continue its internal used vest testing program vestcheck tm 
the other class action suit filed by napo  in ft 
myers  florida lee county  was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice on november  on august   the united states department of justice  nij  released its third nij report 
the third nij report contained  among other items  informatio n and testing data on zylon r and zylon r containing vests  and substantially modified compliance standards for all ballistic resistant vests with the implementation of the nij interim requirements for ballistic resistant bod y armor 
as a result of the actions of the nij  the company halted all sales or shipment of any zylon r containing vest models effective august   and immediately established a supplemental relief renamed the zve program that provides either a cash or voucher option to those who purchased zylon r containing vests from us through august  the zve program  wit h the consent of the sspba  was given final approval by the jacksonville  florida court on october  we are also voluntarily cooperating with a request for documents and data received from the department of justice  which is reviewing the entire body armor industry s use of zylon r  and a subpoena served by the general services administration for information relating to zylon r 
other matters in addition to the above  in the normal course of business and as a result of previous acquisitions  we are subjected to various types of claims and currentl y have on going litigation in the areas of product liability  general liability and intellectual property 
our products are used in a wide variety of law enforcement situations and environments 
some of our products can cause serious personal or property injury or death if not carefully and properly used by adequately trained personnel 
we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for most claims that are incurred in the normal course of business 
in such cases  the effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount of our insurance deductible or self insured retention 
our annual insurance premiums and self insurance retention amounts have risen significantl y over the past several years and may continue to do so to the extent we are able to purchase insurance coverage 
at this time  we do not believe any such claims or pending litigation will have a material impact on our financial position  operations and liquidity

we received million in cash at closing and a note receivable of million  which we collected in full in fiscal on april   we announced that we had completed the sale of our armorgrou p integrated systems business through the sale of of the stock of armorgroup integrated systems  inc and low voltage systems technologies  inc 
to ais  a wholly owned subsidiary of aerwav holdings  llc 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
we record products revenue at the time of shipment 
return s are minimal and do not materially affect the financial statements 
we record aerospace defense group revenue related to government contracts which results principally from fixed price contracts and is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is reasonably determinable  the customer has accepted the product and collectibility is probable 
all of these conditions are met  in substantially all cases  when the department of defense inspector signs the material inspection and receiving report indicating acceptance and title transfer 
we record revenue of the remaining aerospace defense group  products group an d mobile security division when the product is shipped  except for larger commercial contracts typically longer than four months in length 
revenue from large commercial contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion  units of work performed method 
should large commercial contracts be in a loss position  the entire estimated loss would be recognized for the balance of the contract at such time 
current contracts are profitable 
we record service revenue as services are provided on a contract by contract basis 
revenues from service contracts are recognized over the term of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  we review our accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis and determine a provision for accounts receivable that is considered to be uncollectible 
periodically  we compare the identified credit risks with the allowance that ha s been established using historical experience and adjust the allowance accordingly 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we account for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedge activities sfas as amended 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
for fair value hedge transactions in which we hedge changes in an asset s  liability s  or firm commitment s fair value  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument will generally be offset in the income statement by changes in the hedged item s fair value 
put options on company stock are marked to market through the incom e statement at the end of each period 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
goodwill and other intangible assets are stated on the basis of cost 
the million in goodwill resulting from acquisitions made by us subsequent to june  was immediately subjected to the non amortization provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
see also impairment below 
the purchase method of accounting fo r business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or when a possible impairment is indicated  using the fair value based test prescribed by sfas we performed our annual assessment of goodwill and determined that no impairment existed as of june  patents  licenses and trademarks 
patents  licenses and trademarks were primarily acquired through acquisitions accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
such assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their usefu l lives 
certain of these assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant estimates inherent in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financia l statements include the carrying value of long lived assets  valuation allowance s for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  liabilities for potential litigation claims and settlements  potential liabilities related to tax filings in the ordinary course of business  the vest exchange program warranty revision accrual  the defined benefit plan liabilities and contract contingencies and obligations 
actual results could differ from those estimates income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under the asset and liability method specified thereunder  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax base s of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities are offset by deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management s belief that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit associated with temporary differences and operating and capital loss carryforwards will be utilized 
a valuation allowance is recorded for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the realization will not occur 
impairment 
long lived assets  including certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill are reviewed annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset in question may no t be recoverable including  but not limited to  a deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  and when other changes occur which might impair recovery of long lived assets 
the method used to determine the existence of an impairment would be discounted operating cash flows estimated over the remaining useful lives of the related long lived asset or asset groups impairment is measured as the difference between fair value and the unamortized cost at the date an impairment is determined 
comprehensive income 
financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into us dollars at the current rate of exchange existing at period end and revenues and expenses are translated at the average monthly exchange rates 
the current year change in th e accumulated amount  net of tax  is included as a component of comprehensive income 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas we classify our investment in certain equity based securities as available for sale  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
this investment is classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
declines in fair value below the amortized cost basis of this investment that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to earnings 
there were no such other than temporary declines in the year ended december  stock options and grants 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standard number  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  sfas establishes a fair valu e based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans  however it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
under the intrinsic value based method  compensation cost is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we have elected to continue to account for employee stock compensation plans under apb with pro forma disclosures of net earnings and earnings per share  as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in sfas had been applied 
restricted stock awards are generally recorded as compensation expense using fixed accounting over the vesting periods based on the market value on the date of grant except in situations where provisions of the agreements allow for acceleration of vesting upon a certain event 
if the event occurs  this may result in an acceleration of vesting and recognition of associated expense 
if compensation cost for stock option grants had been determined based on the fair value on the grant dates for the years ended december   and  consistent with the method prescribed by sfas  our net earnings and earnings per share would have been adjusted to the pro forma amounts indicated below in thousands  except per share data net income as reported    deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effects    add employee compensation expense for modification of stock option awards included in report net income  net of income taxes pro forma net income    earnings per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma million of the stock based employee compensation expense determined under the fair vale method for fiscal is related to accelerated vesting of certain existing stock options and million is related to certain stock options issued in fiscal on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 share based payment revised fas r 
fas r revises sfas and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
in addition to revising sfas  fas r supersedes apb  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows sfas 
on april   the securities an d exchange commission extended the compliance date of fas r from the first interim to the first annual reporting period of a company s fiscal year beginning on or after june  we will be required to apply the expense recognition provisions of fas r beginning in the first quarter of we expect to incur approximately million of expense in the year ended decembe r  as a result of the adoption of fas r 
results of operations effective june   we decided to sell the armorgroup services division the sale was completed on november  through an organized and formal auction managed by outside advisors 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the operating results of our services division have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods prior to the sale of this division

total revenues increased million  or  to  million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal for fiscal  total revenue increased million  or  internally  including year over year changes in acquired businesses  and million  or  due to acquisitions 
internal revenue growth represents year over year increases in revenue from businesses that were either owned or acquired by us during the periods presented 
our calculation of internal revenue growth takes into consideration pro forma revenue for relevant periods of acquired entities in determining year over year revenue growth 
aerospace defense group revenues 
aerospace defense group revenues increase d million  or  to  million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal for fiscal  aerospace defense group revenue increased million  or  internally  including year over year changes in acquired businesses and million  or  from the acquisition of specialty defense in november and the otv business of second chance acquired in july our calculation of acquired growth is the amount of current year revenue equal to the prior year revenue before our acquisition of the acquired company 
internal growth was primarily due to the following factors we experienced strong demand for the up armored high mobility multi purpose wheeled vehicle up armored hmmwv  commonly known as the humvee  including spare part revenues  as we shipped  m up armored hmmwvs in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal  a increase 
there continues to be new orders under our current m up armored hmmwv contract and additional orders for the next generation versions known as the m and m up armored hmmwvs 
while backlog extends into for both the m and m up armored hmmwv versions  we believe the us military s plans include procurement of a replacement military light transport vehicle with current status being in the early development stage 
while the us military s current acquisition strategies plan for possible production of new light and medium support vehicles beginning as early as  there is no assurance as to when a replacement for the hmmwv may be selected  and furthermore  it is reasonable to believe that the hmmwv will continue for some time to be one of the primary transport vehicles in the us military 
in the event the hmmwv is replaced  based on us military procurement plans  it is anticipated that vehicle armoring for a replacement vehicle would be provided to the vehicle oem for inclusion in the manufacturing process as components to be integrated with the vehicle while additional armor components would be provided for attachment to the vehicle at a later time when warranted by threat conditions 
we anticipate that procurements for the potential hmmwv replacement models would be competitive and could be awarded to multiple armor suppliers based on full and open competition 
although we anticipate continuation of developmental efforts and enhancement of manufacturing capabilities  at this time  there is no certainty of obtaining armoring contracts for any hmmwv replacement vehicles selected by the us military  and if successful in competitive programs  we cannot determine the specific levels of effort likely under such military contracts 
an additional consideration and risk factor regarding the introduction of new vehicle versions for tactical wheeled vehicles is the us military s recent pronouncements that it is the government s preference to own technical data rights for new major end items of equipment and sub systems including the vehicle armoring packages 
the government s intent to mitigate risk of limitations on producibility and to ensure commonality of armor components produced by multiple sources may negatively influence future manufacturing content and product pricing 
see risk factor a replacement of the hmmwv in the us military may affec t our results of operations under item a in part i of this annual report 
during fiscal  revenue from add on armor components for fielded vehicles including add on armor kits for the light  medium and heavy truck fleet operating in iraq increased  compared to fiscal although w e may receive additional add on armor kit business in the future  the majority of armoring of fielded trucks has been completed 
we also believe that the us military s tactical wheeled vehicle procurement strategy includes replacement or additional production of current type medium or heavy trucks and these vehicles are also planned to receive armor subsystems in the future 
sapi plate volume decreased by in fiscal  compared to fiscal the reduction in volume was a result of a change in requirements by the us military and the resultant need to modify product design and to make adjustments in the supply base 
production and deliveries slowed predominantly as a result of the inability of our industrial base to meet delivery requirements at the new enhanced specifications 
we are expanding our current industrial base through the investment in production capacity and have qualified new sources of supply 
continued growth in the sapi plate business is dependent upon the continue d level of hostilities in iraq and afghanistan as well as the us government s requirements for improved technology and performance of the sapi plate 
future revenues may be constrained by our ability to procure certain raw materials necessary for the manufacture of the sapi plate 
see the risk factor there are limited sources for some of our raw materials  which may significantly curtail our manufacturing operations under item a in part i of this annual report 
otv units increased by in fiscal  over fiscal we experienced unit growth in helmets 
also  our molle revenue increased products group revenues 
products group revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal for fiscal  products group revenue decreased million  or  internally including period over period changes in acquired businesses  and increased million  or  from the acquisitions of bianchi international which was completed during the fourth quarter  kleen bore  inc  which was completed during the third quarter of  and the law enforcement business of second chance  acquired in july internal growth was negative due to the decline in sales of ballistic reinforced enclosures for the nuclear power industry  large one time  non recurring sales of ballistic plates in  and a decline in our less lethal business attributable to non recurring  large government orders 
excluding the acquisition of second chance  which was purchased out of bankruptcy and had experienced legal and financial troubles  products group internal revenue growth was 
also  the growth of body armor slowed domestically due to industry concerns regarding zylon r and the nij s decertification of all zylon r containing body armor  and the impact of shortages in the supply of ballistic material 
we expect our american body armor and safariland body armor revenues to rebound from the recent zylon r decertification by the end of the second quarter of we expect to stabiliz e the second chance revenues and be in position for growth in fiscal year mobile security revenues 
mobile security division revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million i n fiscal  primarily due to the increasing threat of terrorism 
commercial vehicle shipments increased  to  vehicles in fiscal compared to  vehicles in fiscal all of mobile security division s revenue growth was internal 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million  or  to  million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  cost of revenues increased to of total revenues for fiscal  from for fiscal gross margins in the aerospace defense group were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal  primarily due to lower selling prices o n m up armored hmmwvs effective in mid  an increased mix of lower margin armor kits  and a temporary decline in gross margins on sapi plates due to incremental costs incurred in the design  manufacture and delivery of updated plates 
gross margins in the products group were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the improvement in gross margins is primarily related to product mix  a shift in production to lower cost manufacturing facilities  and additional inventory provisions in gross margins in the mobile security division were in fiscal  compared to for fiscal the improvement is a result of an improved product mix and manufacturing efficiencies 
cost of vest exchange program warranty revision 
as a result of our voluntary zylon r vest exchange program relating to our zylon r vests  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in fiscal this charge includes estimated exchange program costs and inventory write offs 
through december   we have incurred million and have a remaining liability of million  which includes million remaining from the superseded warranty revisio n and product exchange program 
this liability has been classified in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet at december  as a result of our fiscal warranty revision and product exchange program relating to our zylon r containing vests  we recorded a net pre tax charge of million  which includes all the legal costs associated with the class action lawsuits settled in the warranty revision and product exchange program has been superseded by the vest exchange program 
in april   two class action lawsuits were filed against us in florida stat e court by police organizations and individual police officers  alleging that ballistic resistant soft body armor vests containing zylon r  manufactured and sold by american body armor tm  safariland r and protech r  failed to meet the warranties provided with the vests 
on november   the jacksonville  florida duval county circuit court gave final approval to a settlement reached with the sspba which provided that i purchasers of certain zylon r containing vest models could exchange their vests for other vests manufactured by the company and  ii the company would continue its internal used vest testing program vestcheck tm 
the other class action suit  which was filed by napo  in ft 
myers  florida lee county  was voluntarily dismisse d with prejudice on november  on august   the united states department of justice  nij  released its third nij report 
the third nij report contained  among other items  informatio n and testing data on zylon r and zylon r containing vests  and substantially modified compliance standards for all ballistic resistant vests with the implementation of the nij interim requirements for ballistic resistant bod y armor 
as a result of the actions of the nij  the company halted all sales or shipment of any zylon r containing vest models effective august   and immediately established a supplemental relief renamed the zve program that provides either a cash or voucher option to those who purchased any zylon r containing vests from us through august  the zve program  wit h the consent of the sspba  was given final approval by the jacksonville  florida court on october  we are also voluntarily cooperating with a request for documents and data received from the department of justice  which is reviewing the body armor industry s use of zylon r  and a subpoena served by the general services administration for information relating to zylon r 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million of total revenues for fiscal  compared to million of total revenues for fiscal the decrease as a percentage of revenues was largely a function of our ability to achieve scale as revenues have increased  and the fourth quarter of acquisition of specialty defense  which operates with lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues than the products group and the mobile security division 
aerospace defense group selling  general and administrative expenses increase d million  or  to million of aerospace defense group revenues for fiscal  compared to million of aerospace defense group revenues for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to additional expenses associated as a result of the acquisition of specialty defense in november  increased research and development expense  and an increase in administrative expenses as a result of increased production of the m up armored hmmwv  m kits and supplemental armor for other military vehicles 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was due to leveraging these expenses over a larger revenue base 
products group selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million of products group revenues for fiscal  compared to million of products group revenues for fiscal the increase is primarily due to the impact of acquisitions  which amounted to million of the increase  as well as increased marketing and advertising expenses  and management severance expenses 
mobile security division selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million of mobile security division revenues for fiscal  compared to million of mobile security division revenues for fiscal the increase in expense was primarily due t o increased research and development costs  increased selling and marketing costs for the roll out of the centigon tm brand name  and the negative impact of a weaker us dollar when converting foreign based expenses to us dollars 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to the non recurring nature of the roll out costs of the centigon tm brand name and the additional research and development costs 
corporate general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million of total revenues for fiscal  compared to million of total revenues for fiscal this increase in administrative expenses is associated with the overall growth of the company  including increased travel expenses  bonus expense  pension expense  accounting fees  legal fees  hiring costs and insurance expenses 
amortization 
amortization expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  primarily du e to the amortization of certain intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisitions of second chance in july  bianchi in december and specialty defense in november integration 
integration expense increased million  or  to millio n for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal integration expense in fiscal primarily included charges for the integration of second chance  which was acquired in july  and specialty defense and bianchi  which were acquired in the fourth quarter of integration expense in fiscal primarily included charges for integration related to the acquisitions of simul a and hatch imports  which were acquired in the fourth quarter of other charges 
other charges for fiscal were million 
other charges for fiscal were million 
other charges in fiscal were charges fo r a non cash charge of million related to the acceleration of performance based  long term restricted stock awards granted to certain executives in  and an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the remaining portion of nti to its estimated fair value 
operating income 
operating income increased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  decreased  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal this decreas e is primarily due to an increase in interest income generated from the increase in investment yield from higher interest rates and the increase in investment balances primarily resulting from our convertible notes offering in the fourth quarter of and positive operating cash flow 
this increase is partially offset by an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of the convertible notes and the increase in the six month libor 
on september   we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively exchanged the fixed rate on the notes for a variable rate of six month libor at december   and at december   set in arrears  plus a spread of to 
other income expense  net 
other income  net  which was million for fiscal  relates primarily to the expiration of our unexercised  millio n previously announced sale of put option contracts on company stock as well as a n increase in the fair market value of million new put option contracts on company stock we entered into  which expired unexercised in february of the million in other income related to the sale of put options on company stock in fiscal  million related to the expiration of the million unexercised put options 
the other income is partially offset by a non cash asset impairment  loss on disposal of fixed assets and losses related to foreig n currency transactions 
other expense  net  of million for fiscal  relates primarily to a non cash  asset impairment  loss on disposal of fixed assets and losses related to foreign currency fluctuations 
income before provision for income taxes 
income before provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  due to the reasons discussed above 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the effective tax rate was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the decreased tax rate relates primarily to the non taxable  fair market gain on put options sold on company stock in fiscal  and the non tax deductible charge due to the accelerated vesting of performance based  long term restricted stock awards during fiscal net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above

internal growth was due to strong sales of international body armor  and other soft armor and hard armor sectors  providin g protection to troops and private sector employees within iraq  strong military and international sales within duty gear and the sales of ballistic reinforced enclosures within the energy sector 
mobile security division revenues 
our mobile security division revenues increased million  or  to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal all of the revenue growth for the mobile security division was generated internally  primarily as a result of the increasing threat of terrorism  and  to a less extent  the impact of a weakened us dolla r versus the euro

the stock incentive plan authorizes the granting of stock options  restricted stock  performance awards and other stock based awards to employees  officers  directors and consultants  independent contractors and advisors of the company and its subsidiaries 
in accordance with the stock incentive plan  our pre existing stock incentive plans are frozen

on june   our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation  as amended  that increased the number of shares of our authorize d capital stock to  of which  shares are designated as commo n stock and  shares are designated as preferred stock 
on june   we sold  primary shares of common stock at a price o f per share  raising million of net proceeds after deducting the underwriter discounts and commissions 
in addition  our board of directors granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to  shares 
the day option expired unexercised on july  we used the net proceeds from the offering to primarily fund the acquisitions of specialty defense and bianchi international in the fourth quarter of on october   we completed the placement of the convertible notes 
on november   goldman  sachs co 
exercised its option to purchase an additional million principal amount of the convertible notes 
the convertible notes provide the holders with a seven year put option and are guaranteed by most of our domestic subsidiaries on a senior subordinated basis 
the convertible notes were initially rated b b by moody s investors service and standard poor s rating services  respectively 
the convertible notes will bear interest at a rate of per year  payable on november and may of each year beginning on may   and ending on november  th e convertible notes will be subject to accretion of the principal amount beginning on november   at a rate that provides holders with an aggregat e annual yield to maturity of  as defined in the agreement 
the convertible notes will bear contingent interest during any six month period beginning november   of basis points paid in cash if the average trading price of the notes is above certain levels 
the convertible notes will be convertible  at the bond holder s option at any time  initially at a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is the equivalent conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
upon conversion  we will satisfy our conversion obligation with respect to the accreted principal amount of the note s to be converted in cash  with any remaining amount to be satisfied in shares of our common stock 
the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment  without duplication  upon the occurrence of any of the following events stock dividends in common stock  issuance of rights and warrants  stock split s and combinations  distribution of indebtedness  securities or assets  cash distributions  tender or exchange offers  and repurchases of commo n stock 
in accordance with us gaap  the convertible notes are classified as short term debt as they can be converted at any time prior to maturity 
we used a portion of the proceeds of the offering to fund the acquisition of second chance in july  and for general corporate and working capital purposes  including the funding of capital expenditures 
funds that are not immediately used are invested in money market funds and other investment grade securities until needed 
on august   we completed a private placement of million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes are guaranteed by most of our domestic subsidiaries on a senior subordinated basis 
the notes were sold to qualified institutional investors in reliance on rule a of the securities act of  as amended  and to non us persons in reliance on regulation s under the securities act of  as amended 
in  after the completion of the private placement of the notes  we conducted an exchang e offer pursuant to which holders of the privately placed notes exchanged such notes for notes registered under the securities act of  as amended 
the notes were initially rated b b by moody s investors service and standard poor s rating services  respectively 
we used a portion of the funds to repay debt  acquire simula  inc  hatch imports  inc  odv  inc  and kleen bore  inc  and we used the remaining proceeds of the offering to fund acquisitions and for general corporate and working capital purposes  including the funding of capital expenditures 
on march   we completed a registered exchange offer for the notes and exchanged the notes for new notes that were registered under the securities act of  as amended 
on september   we entered into interest rate swap agreements  which have been designated as fair value hedges as defined under sfas with a notional amount totaling million 
the agreements were entered into to exchange the fixed interest rate on our notes for a variable interest rate equal to six month libor  set in arrears  plus a spread ranging from to fixed semi annually on the fifteenth day of february and august 
the agreements are subject to other terms and conditions common to transactions of this type 
in accordance with sfas  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swa p agreements offset changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in the market interest rate 
accordingly  interest rate swaps included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet decreased by million fro m december   which reflected a decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements to million 
the corresponding decrease in the hedge liability was recorded in long term debt 
the agreements are deemed to be a perfectly effective fair value hedge  and  therefore  qualify for the short cut method of accounting under sfas as a result  no ineffectiveness is expecte d to be recognized in our earnings associated with the interest rate swap agreements 
on august   in concert with our note offering  we entered into th e credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a five year revolving credit facility  and  among other things  provides for i total maximum borrowings of million  ii a million sub limit for the issuances of standby and commercial letters of credit  iii a million sub limit for swing line loans and iv a million sub limit for multi currency borrowings 
all borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at either i a rate equal to libor  plus an applicable margin ranging from to  ii an alternate base rate which will be the higher of a the bank of america prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus  or iii with respect to foreig n currency loans  a fronted offshore currency rate  plus an applicable margin ranging from to  depending on certain conditions 
the credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and is collateralized by  among other things  i a pledge of all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock or other equity interests of certain of our domestic subsidiaries  ii a pledge of of the issued and outstanding voting shares of stock or other voting equity interests of certain of our direct and indirect foreign subsidiaries  iii a pledge of of the issued and outstanding nonvoting shares of stock or other nonvoting equity interests of certain of our direct and indirect foreign subsidiaries  and iv a first priority perfected security interest on certain of our domestic assets and certain domestic assets of certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries that will become guarantors of our obligations under the credit facility  including  among other things  accounts receivable  inventory  machinery  equipment  certain contract rights  intellectual property rights and general intangibles 
on january   we amended our credit facility to broaden our ability to make additional open market purchases of publicly traded securities subject to certain limitations 
on march   we amended our credit facility to allow us to pay dividends subject to certain limitations 
on october   we amended our credit facility to allow us to subtract cash equivalents from total indebtedness in calculation of our compliance covenants 
on april   we amended our credit agreement to amend the definition of cash equivalents to include auction rate securities held by our existing bank group 
on july   we amended the credit facility to allow for advances  loans  extensions o f credit to or any other investments in key suppliers of the company in an aggregate amount not to exceed million at any time outstanding for the purpose of facilitating the sale and purchase of goods and services to the company 
in addition  the amendment allows for leases or other dispositions of assets of not more than of the consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credi t facility 
at december   we had million in availability under our credit facility  excluding million in outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   we believe we were in material compliance with all of our negative and affirmative covenants contained in the credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and the convertible notes 
working capital was million and million as of december   and december   respectively 
the increase in working capital is largely a function of increases in cash and cash equivalents of million  accounts receivable of million and inventory of million partially offset by the increase in accounts payable of million primarily to support the growth in demand for our force protection related products from the us department of defense 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal net cash provided by operating activities improved due to increased net income for fiscal  and was negatively impacted due to increases in working capital in both periods 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the purchase of second chance in compared to the purchases of specialty defens e and bianchi among others in  partially offset by the purchase of equity based securities in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal including the issuance of the convertible bonds and the sale of  shares of company stock 
we have revised our and consolidated statements of cash flow to separately disclose the operating  investing and financing portions of cash flows attributable to our discontinued operations 
we had previously reported these amounts on a combined basis 
our fiscal capital expenditures were million 
such expenditures included additional manufacturing and office space  manufacturing machinery and equipment  leasehold improvements  information technology and communications infrastructure equipment 
our fiscal capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to million 
on february   we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding stock of stewart stevenson services  inc svc  a leading manufacturer of military tactical wheeled vehicles including the fmtv  the us army s primary transport platform  for per share in a cash merger transaction 
the total value of the transaction is expected to be approximately million after deducting svc s net cash balance which was million as of january  the transaction is subject to svc shareholder approval  the expiration or termination of the hart scott rodino waiting period and other customary conditions 
the transaction is expected to close mid we expect to finance the transaction through available cash and with proceeds from new senior credit facilities 
on february   standard poor s ratings services affirmed its b rating on our senior subordinated debt 
also on february   moody s investors service announced that it will review our debt ratings for a possible downgrade on its b rating of our senior subordinated debt in the wake of our announcemen t that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding stock of svc 
we anticipate that the cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and available borrowings under the credit facility will enable us to meet liquidity working capital and capital expenditure requirements during the next months 
we may  however  require additional financing to pursue our strategy of growth through acquisitions  including new senior credit facilities associated with ou r pending acquisition of stewart stevenson services  inc  and we are continuously exploring alternatives 
if such financing is required  there are n o assurances that it will be available  or if available  that it can be obtained on terms favorable to us or on a basis that is not dilutive to our stockholders recently issued accounting standards on december   the fasb issued fas r 
fas r revises sfas and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and othe r forms of stock based compensation 
in addition to revising sfas  fas r supersedes apb  and amends sfas on april   the securities and exchange commission extended the compliance date of fas r from the first interim to the first annual reporting period of a company s fiscal year beginning on or after june  we will be required to apply the expense recognition provisions of fas r beginning in the first quarter of we expect to incur approximately million of expense in the year ended decembe r   as a result of the adoption of fas r 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulleting no 
 chapter inventory pricing  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage are to be recognized as current period charges 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our revenue or profitability 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices o r improving cost efficiencies 
off balance sheet arrangements on september   we entered into an off balance sheet leasing arrangement for an aircraft for company use 
upon expiration of this lease on september   a subsidiary of the company has the option to renew the lease at fair market value subject to approval by the lessor  or  buy the aircraft for approximately million  or return the aircraft to the lessor and  under a guarantee  pay any shortfall in sales proceeds from a third party in an amount not to exceed million 
annual rental expense related to this agreement is approximately million 
excluding this leasing arrangement  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financial activities  we are exposed to changes in raw material prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and our stock price  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposure to changes in raw material prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates through our regular operating and financing activities 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce our overall interest expense 
market rate risk the following discussion about our market rate risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity security price risk as a result of the sale of put option on our company stock 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to borrowings under our million senior subordinate d notes  our credit facilities and our short term monetary investments 
to the extent that  from time to time  we hold short term money market instruments  there is a market rate risk for changes in interest rates on such instruments 
to that extent  there is inherent rollover risk in the short term money market instruments as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable  because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
however  there is only a remote risk of loss of principal in the short term money market instruments 
the main risk is related to a potential reduction in future interest income 
on september   we entered into interest rate swap agreements in which we effectively exchanged the million fixed rate interest on the senior subordinated notes for variable rates in the notional amount of million  million  and million at six month libor  set in arrears  plus   and  respectively 
the agreements involve receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
the variable interest rates are fixed semi annually on the fifteenth day of february and august each year through maturity 
the six month libor rate was on march  th e maturity dates of the interest rate swap agreements match those of the underlying debt 
our objective for entering into these interest rate swaps was to reduce our exposure to changes in the fair value of senior subordinated note s and to obtain variable rate financing at an attractive cost 
changes in the six month libor would affect our earnings either positively or negatively 
an assumed basis point increase in the six month libor would increase our interest obligations under the interest rate swaps by approximately millio n for a twelve month period 
in accordance with sfas  we designated the interest rate swap agreements as perfectly effective fair value hedges and  accordingly  use the short cut metho d of evaluating effectiveness 
as permitted by the short cut method  the change i n fair value of the interest rate swaps will be reflected in earnings and an equivalent amount will be reflected as a change in the carrying value of the swaps  with an offset to earnings 
there is no ineffectiveness to be recorded 
on december   we recorded the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements of million and recorded the corresponding fair value adjustment to the notes in other assets and long term debt sections of the consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments 
however  counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions and the risk of loss due to nonperformance is considered by management to be minimal 
we do not hold or issue interest rate swap agreements or other derivative instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our business is denominate d in us dollars 
there are costs associated with our operations in foreign countries that require payments in the local currency 
where appropriate and to partially manage our foreign currency risk related to those payments  we receiv e payment from customers in local currencies in amounts sufficient to meet our local currency obligations 
we do not use derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge foreign currency risk 
marketable security price risk 
at december   our marketable securities had a fair value of million  including an unrealized loss of million the estimated loss in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the price would have been million 
since the securities are classified as available for sale  adjustments to fai r value of a temporary nature are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss  and would not impact our results of operations or cash flows until such time that the securities are sold or that the impairment is determined to be other than temporary in nature 
stock price risk 
the fair values of the put options of company stock are obtained from our counter parties and represent the estimated amount we would receive or pay to terminate the put options  taking into account the consideration we received for the sale of the put options 
as our stock price fluctuates the value of these contracts also fluctuates 
for fiscal  we incurred a fair value gain of million  recorded in other income  net  of which million was recognized on the million previously expired and unexercised put options 
in february  the outstanding put options covering million shares expired unexercised 
accordingly  we recorded an additional million in other income in the first quarter of fiscal risks associated with international operations we do business in numerous countries  including emerging markets in south america 
we have invested resources outside of the united states and plan to continue to do so in the future 
our international operations are subject to th e risk of new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  tariffs and trade barriers  potential difficulties in staffing and managing local operations  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  and local economic  political and social conditions 
governments of many developing countries have exercised and continue to exercise substantia l influence over many aspects of the private sector 
government actions in the future could have a significant adverse effect on economic conditions in a developing country or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on us and ou r operating companies 
we do not have political risk insurance in the countries i n which we currently conduct business  but periodically analyze the need for and cost associated with this type of policy 
moreover  applicable agreements relating to our interests in our operating companies are frequently governed by foreign law 
as a result  in the event of a dispute  it may be difficult for us to enforce our rights 
accordingly  we may have little or no recourse upon the occurrence of any of these developments
