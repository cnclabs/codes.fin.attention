on october   gamestop holdings corp 
historical gamestop  formerly known as gamestop corp  and electronics boutique holdings corp 
eb or electronics boutique completed their previously announced merger pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger  dated as of april  the merger agreement 
upon the consummation of the mergers  historical gamestop and eb became wholly owned subsidiaries of gamestop corp  formerly known as gsc holdings corp  the company  a delaware corporation formed for the purpose of consummating the business combination the mergers 
the mergers of historical gamestop and eb have been treated as a purchase business combination for accounting purposes  with historical gamestop designated as the acquirer 
therefore  the historical financial statements of historical gamestop became the historical financial statements of the company  the registrant 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto include the results of operations of eb from october  forward 
therefore  the company s operating results for the fiscal year ended january  include weeks of eb s results and weeks  respectively  of historical gamestop s results 
management expects sales  sales mix  cost of sales  gross profit  selling general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization and interest expense in fiscal to be significantly impacted by including the operations of eb for a full year  as opposed to weeks in fiscal  which included the holiday selling season 
growth in each of these statement of operations line items will come from each of the company s business segments 
under the terms of the merger agreement  historical gamestop s stockholders received one share of the company s class a common stock for each share of historical gamestop s class a common stock owned and one share of the company s class b common stock for each share of historical gamestop s class b common stock owned 
approximately million shares of the company s class a common stock were issued in exchange for all outstanding class a common stock of historical gamestop based on the one for one ratio and approximately million shares of the company s class b common stock were issued in exchange for all outstanding class b

growth in the video game industry is driven by the introduction of new technology 
in october  sony introduced playstation and  in november  microsoft introduced xbox and nintendo introduced gamecube 
nintendo introduced the game boy advance sp in march and the ds in november sony introduced the playstation portable the psp in march and microsoft introduced the xbox in november as is typical following the introduction of new video game platforms  sales of new video game hardware generally increase as a percentage of sales in the first full year following introduction 
as video game platforms mature  the sales mix attributable to complementary video game software and accessories  which generate higher gross margins  generally increases in the second and third years 
the net effect is generally a decline in gross margins in the first full year following new platform releases and an increase in gross margins in the second and third years 
unit sales of maturing video game platforms are typically also driven by manufacturer funded retail price decreases  further driving sales of related software and accessories 
we expect that the installed base of the hardware platforms listed above and sales of related software and accessories will increase in the future 
sony is expected to launch the playstation and nintendo is expected to launch the revolution in late we expect that our gross margin in fiscal will be impacted by the anticipated launches of these new products 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies which are important in determining the reporting of transactions and events use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used by management could have significant impact on the company s financial results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sales of the company s products is recognized at the time of sale 
the sales of used video game products are recorded at the retail price charged to the customer 
sales returns which are not significant are recognized at the time returns are made 
subscription and advertising revenues are recorded upon release of magazines for sale to consumers and are stated net of sales discounts 
magazine subscription revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription period 
revenue from the sales of product replacement plans is recognized on a straight line basis over the coverage period 
merchandise inventories 
our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market using the average cost method 
used video game products traded in by customers are recorded as inventory at the amount of the store credit given to the customer 
in valuing inventory  management is required to make assumptions regarding the necessity of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or over valued items at the lower of cost or market 
management considers quantities on hand  recent sales  potential price protections and returns to vendors  among other factors  when making these assumptions 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation on furniture  fixtures and equipment is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from two to eight years 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred  while betterments and major remodeling costs are capitalized 
leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the respective leases  including renewal options in 
table of contents which the exercise of the option is reasonably assured generally ranging from three to ten years 
costs incurred in purchasing management information systems are capitalized and included in property and equipment 
these costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives from the date the systems become operational 
the company periodically reviews its property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated 
the company assesses recoverability based on several factors  including management s intention with respect to its stores and those stores projected undiscounted cash flows 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the present value of their projected cash flows 
as a result of the mergers and an analysis of assets to be abandoned  the company impaired assets totaling million 
write downs incurred by the company through january  which were not related to the mergers have not been material 
merger related costs 
in connection with the mergers  management incurred merger related costs and commenced integration activities which have resulted in  or will result in  involuntary employment terminations  lease terminations  disposals of property and equipment and other costs and expenses 
approximately million of these costs and expenses were charged to acquisition costs  representing a portion of the recorded goodwill  and approximately million were charged to costs and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the liability for involuntary termination benefits covers severance amounts  payroll taxes and benefit costs for approximately employees  primarily in general and administrative functions in eb s pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center and nevada call center  which are expected to be closed in the first half of fiscal termination of these employees began in october and is expected to be completed by july certain senior executives with eb received payments in the amount of million in accordance with employment contracts 
the pennsylvania corporate office and distribution center are owned facilities which are currently being marketed for sale and are classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as assets held for sale 
sale of these facilities is expected to occur in fiscal the liability for lease terminations is associated with stores and the nevada call center to be closed and will be paid over the remaining lease terms through if the company is unsuccessful in negotiating lease terminations or sublease agreements 
the company began closing these stores in fiscal and intends to close the remainder of these stores in the next to months 
the disposals of property and equipment are related to assets of historical gamestop which are either impaired or have been  or will be  either abandoned or disposed of due to the mergers 
certain costs associated with the disposition of these assets remain as an accrual until the assets are disposed of and the costs are paid  which is expected to occur in the next few months 
merger related costs include professional fees  financing costs and other costs associated with the mergers and include certain ongoing costs associated with integrating the operations of historical gamestop and eb  including relocation costs 
the company is working to finalize integration plans which may result in additional involuntary employment terminations  lease and other contractual terminations and employee relocations 
the company will finalize integration plans and related liabilities in fiscal and management anticipates completion of all integration activities in fiscal finalization of integration plans may result in additional liabilities which will increase goodwill 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements provides additional information on the merger costs and related liabilities 
goodwill 
goodwill  aggregating million was recorded in the acquisition of funco in and through the application of push down accounting in accordance with sab in connection with the acquisition of babbage s in by a subsidiary of barnes noble  inc barnes noble 
goodwill in the amount of million was recorded in connection with the acquisition of gamesworld group limited in goodwill in the amount of  million was recorded in connection with the mergers 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis 
in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company completed annual impairment tests of the goodwill attributable to its reporting unit as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal and fiscal and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired 
through january   the company determined that it had one reporting unit based upon the similar economic characteristics of its operations 
fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using market capitalization methodologies 
subsequent to the mergers  the company determined that it has four reporting units  the united states  australia  canada and 
table of contents europe  based upon the similar economic characteristics of operations in those regions 
the company employed the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the allocation of goodwill resulting from the mergers to the four reporting units as of october   the date of the mergers 
the company also completed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal and concluded that none of its goodwill was impaired 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements of the company provides additional information concerning goodwill 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of non compete agreements  point of sale software and amounts attributed to favorable leasehold interests acquired in the mergers and are included in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the total weighted average amortization period for the intangible assets  excluding goodwill  is approximately four years 
the intangible assets are being amortized based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are being utilized  with no expected residual value 
the deferred financing fees associated with the company s revolving credit facility and the senior notes and senior floating rate notes issued in connection with the financing of the mergers are separately shown in the consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred financing fees are being amortized over five  six and seven years to match the terms of the revolving credit facility  the senior floating rate notes and the senior notes  respectively 
cash consideration received from vendors 
the company and its vendors participate in cooperative advertising programs and other vendor marketing programs in which the vendors provide the company with cash consideration in exchange for marketing and advertising the vendors products 
our accounting for cooperative advertising arrangements and other vendor marketing programs  in accordance with fasb emerging issues task force issue or eitf  results in a portion of the consideration received from our vendors reducing the product costs in inventory 
the consideration serving as a reduction in inventory is recognized in cost of sales as inventory is sold 
the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory is determined by calculating the ratio of vendor allowances in excess of specific  incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs to merchandise purchases 
the company then applies this ratio to the value of inventory in determining the amount of vendor reimbursements recorded as a reduction to inventory reflected on the balance sheet 
because of the variability in the timing of our advertising and marketing programs throughout the year  the company uses significant estimates in determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory in interim periods  including estimates of full year vendor allowances  specific  incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs  merchandise purchases and value of inventory 
estimates of full year vendor allowances and the value of inventory are dependent upon estimates of full year merchandise purchases 
determining the amount of vendor allowances recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of the fiscal year no longer requires the use of estimates as all vendor allowances  specific  incremental and identifiable advertising and promotional costs  merchandise purchases and value of inventory are known 
although management considers its advertising and marketing programs to be effective  we do not believe that we would be able to incur the same level of advertising expenditures if the vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances 
in addition  management believes that the company s revenues would be adversely affected if its vendors decreased or discontinued their allowances  but management is unable to quantify the impact 
lease accounting 
as previously disclosed  in fiscal  the company  similar to many other retailers  revised its method of accounting for rent expense and related deferred rent liability and leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives for allowances under operating leases tenant improvement allowances to conform to gaap  as clarified by the chief accountant of the sec in a february letter to the american institute of certified public accountants 
for all stores opened since the beginning of fiscal  the company had calculated straight line rent expense using the initial lease term  but was generally depreciating leasehold improvements over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the initial lease term plus the option periods 
the company corrected its calculation of straight line rent expense to include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which it is reasonably assured of exercising lease options and to include in the lease term any period during which the company is not obligated to pay rent while the store is being constructed rent holiday 
the company also corrected its calculation of depreciation expense for leasehold improvements for those leases which do not include an option period 
because the effects of the correction were not material to any previous years  a non cash  after tax adjustment of million was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal to correct the method of accounting for rent expense and related deferred rent liability 
of the million after tax adjustment  million pertained to the 
table of contents accounting for rent holidays  million pertained to the calculation of straight line rent expense to include the impact of escalating rents for periods in which the company is reasonably assured of exercising lease options and million pertained to the calculation of depreciation expense for leasehold improvements for the small portion of leases which do not include an option period 
the aggregate effect of these corrections relating to prior years was million million for fiscal and million for years prior to fiscal 
the correction does not affect historical or future cash flows or the timing of payments under related leases 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas utilizes an asset and liability approach  and deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effect of differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
as a result of our operations in many foreign countries  our global tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we base our estimate of an annual effective tax rate at any given point in time on a calculated mix of the tax rates applicable to our company and to estimates of the amount of income to be derived in any given jurisdiction 
we file our tax returns based on our understanding of the appropriate tax rules and regulations 
however  complexities in the tax rules and our operations  as well as positions taken publicly by the taxing authorities  may lead us to conclude that accruals for uncertain tax positions are required 
we generally maintain accruals for uncertain tax positions until examination of the tax year is completed by the taxing authority  available review periods expire or additional facts and circumstances cause us to change our assessment of the appropriate accrual amount 
the financial accounting standards board has been evaluating the accounting for uncertain tax positions and is likely to issue guidance during for all companies to follow 
we believe our current processes are consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement items as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year ended ended ended january  january  january  statement of operations data sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization merger related expenses operating earnings interest expense income  net merger related interest expense earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings the company includes purchasing  receiving and distribution costs in selling  general and administrative expenses  rather than cost of goods sold  in the statement of operations 
for the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  these purchasing  receiving and distribution costs amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
the company includes processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in cost of sales  rather than selling  general and administrative expenses  in the statement of operations 
for the fiscal years ended january   january  and january  these processing fees amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
as a result of these classifications  
table of contents our gross margins are not comparable to those retailers that include purchasing  receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the net effect of the company s classifications is that its cost of sales as a percentage of sales is higher than  and its selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are lower than  they would have been had the company s treatment conformed with those retailers that include purchasing  receiving and distribution costs in cost of sales and include processing fees associated with purchases made by check and credit cards in selling  general and administrative expenses  by  and for the fiscal years ended january   january  and january   respectively

as stores in europe mature  the company expects operating profit to increase 
because the fiscal segment results for international operations consist primarily of the results for the weeks of eb s operations owned by the company  management does not believe that further discussion of the segment results will be meaningful 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales increased by  million  or  from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the increase in sales was primarily attributable to approximately million in sales from eb for the weeks of its operations owned by the company  approximately million in non comparable sales resulting from the net new gamestop stores opened since january  and approximately million due to an increase in comparable historical gamestop store sales of 
this comparable store sales increase was expected due to the launch of sony playstation portable in march and the launch of microsoft xbox hardware in november on a pro forma basis  comparable store sales decreased in fiscal stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation

used video game product sales also grew due to an increase in store count  efforts to increase the supply of used inventory available for sale and the mergers  with an increase in sales of million  or  from fiscal sales of other product categories  including pc entertainment and other software and accessories  magazines and character related merchandise  grew  or million  from fiscal to fiscal  due to the mergers 
cost of sales increased by million  or  from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal as a result of the changes in gross profit discussed below 
gross profit increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of increases in vendor allowances received in excess of advertising expenses  which are recorded as a reduction in cost of sales 
in fiscal  vendor allowances received in excess of advertising expenses were million compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to the ownership of eb during the fourth fiscal quarter  during which much of the year s advertising allowances are generated  and due to the launch of the xbox  which generated additional advertising allowances 
gross profit as a percentage of sales on new hardware  new software and other products increased due to the increase in vendor allowances received as discussed above 
the gross profit on new hardware increased from of sales in fiscal to in fiscal because new hardware platforms typically have lower margins than established hardware platforms  as expected  the launch of the sony psp and the microsoft xbox had an offsetting effect on new hardware gross profit as a percentage of sales 
gross profit as a percentage of sales on new software increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to the increase in vendor allowances received  as discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of sales on other products increased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales on used video game products increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to increased efforts to monitor margin rates and  following the mergers  the application of gamestop s merchandising algorithms to eb s used video game category 
the company expects gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal to be impacted by the anticipated launch in late of two new hardware platforms in the united states and the march launch of microsoft s xbox hardware platform in australia 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of this increase was attributable to the mergers and the remainder was due to increases in the number of stores in operation  and the related increases in store  distribution  and corporate office operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to combining the full year results of historical gamestop s operations with the weeks of eb s operations  including the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year typically experiences high leveraging of selling  general and administrative expenses due to the holiday selling season 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in selling  general and administrative expenses and amounted to million in fiscal  compared to an immaterial amount of loss in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase of million was due primarily to depreciation of eb s assets of million after the mergers  with the remaining increase due to capital expenditures for new gamestop stores and management information systems and the commencement in the third quarter of fiscal of full operations in the company s new distribution facility 
depreciation and amortization expense will increase from fiscal to fiscal due to the mergers  continued capital expenditures for new stores and management information systems and due to a full year of depreciation on the company s new distribution facility 
the company s results of operations for fiscal include expenses believed to be of a one time or short term nature associated with the mergers  which included million included in operating earnings and million included in interest expenses 
the million included million in one time charges associated with assets of the company considered to be impaired because they were redundant as a result of the mergers 
the million of merger related interest expense resulted primarily from a commitment fee of million for bridge 
table of contents financing as a contingency in the event that we were unable to issue the senior notes and senior floating rate notes prior to the consummation of the mergers 
interest income resulting from the investment of excess cash balances increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due to an increase in the average yield on the investments  interest of million earned on the investment of the million in proceeds of the offering of the senior notes and the senior floating rate notes from the issuance date on september  until the date of the mergers on october  and interest income earned by eb after the mergers on its invested assets 
interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal primarily due to the interest incurred on the million senior notes payable and the million senior floating rate notes payable and the interest incurred on the note payable to barnes noble in connection with the repurchase of historical gamestop s class b common stock in fiscal interest expense on the company s debt is expected to be approximately million in fiscal income tax expense increased by million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company s effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal due to expenses related to the mergers and corporate restructuring

stores are included in our comparable store sales base beginning in the thirteenth month of operation 
the strong new game releases in fiscal led to an increase in new video game software sales of million  or  from fiscal and an increase in new software sales as a percentage of total sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the declining price points and hardware shortages described above curtailed the expected growth in new hardware  resulting in a modest  or million  increase in sales and a decline in hardware sales as a percentage of total sales from in fiscal to in fiscal used video game products continued to show strong growth  with an increase in sales of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and an increase as a percentage of total sales from in fiscal to in fiscal this growth was due to our store growth in strip centers and the availability of used products for sale caused by trade ins of used video game products in response to the strong new game releases

revised  share based payment  sfas r 
this statement requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
currently  companies are required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and can elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements 
we have chosen to disclose the pro forma effect 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in sfas r  however  in adopting this standard  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the valuation model and amortization assumption we have used continue to be available and we intend to continue to use them 
sfas r will be effective for the company beginning in fiscal transition options allow companies to choose whether to adopt prospectively  restate results to the beginning of the year  or to restate prior periods with the amounts on a basis consistent with pro forma amounts that have been included in their footnotes 
we have concluded that we will adopt on the modified prospective basis 
for the pro forma effect on fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  using our existing valuation and amortization assumptions  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report on form k 
we expect that the implementation of sfas r will reduce net income by approximately million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal the weeks ended february  and fiscal the weeks ended january   respectively  based on the terms and conditions of non vested stock options outstanding as of january  in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no

sfas sp will be effective for the company beginning in fiscal however  the company previously corrected its calculation of straight line rent expense to include in the lease term any period during which the company is not obligated to pay rent while the store is being constructed 
the implementation of sfas sp is not expected to have an impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
seasonality our business  like that of many retailers  is seasonal  with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon  among other factors  the timing of new product introductions and new store openings  
table of contents sales contributed by new stores  increases or decreases in comparable store sales  adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions and changes in our merchandise mix 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate exposure 
we limit our interest rate risks by investing our excess cash balances in short term  highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of one year or less 
in addition  the notes issued in connection with the mergers include both fixed rate and floating rate notes with the intent to minimize exposure to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of of the effective rate on the floating rate notes would result in a change in the annual interest expense of million 
the effective rate on the floating rate notes was on january  we do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances  and we believe that our interest rate exposure is modest 
foreign currency risk the mergers significantly increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations because a larger amount of our business is now transacted in foreign currencies 
while historical gamestop generally did not enter into derivative instruments with respect to foreign currency risks  electronics boutique routinely used forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to manage currency risk and had a number of open positions designated as hedge transactions as of the merger date 
the company discontinued hedge accounting treatment for all derivative instruments acquired in connection with the mergers 
the company follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction  and if it is  depending on the type of hedge transaction 
the company uses forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps to manage currency risk primarily related to intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies and certain foreign currency assets and liabilities 
these forward exchange contracts and currency swaps are not designated as hedges and  therefore  changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings  thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the re measurement of related intercompany loans and foreign currency assets and liabilities 
the aggregate fair value of these forwards and swaps at january  was a loss of million 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of in foreign currency exchange rates underlying these forwards and swaps from the market rate at january  would result in a loss or gain in value of the forwards and swaps of million or million  respectively 
the company had no forward exchange contracts and currency swaps prior to october
