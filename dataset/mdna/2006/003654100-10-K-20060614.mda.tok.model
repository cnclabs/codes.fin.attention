overview the company is a leading provider of medical products and services in the area of circulatory care 
the company s strategy is centered around establishing recovery as the standard of care for acute patients 
the two products of the company designed for heart recovery  and approved by the fda  following acute events are the ab and bvs the company s impella products are ce marked in europe and are discussed in more detail in this overview section 
our ab circulatory support system is a heart assist product designed to provide enhanced patient mobility within and between medical centers  to facilitate patient ambulation and to provide enhanced features and ease of use for caregivers 
the ab console serves as a platform for ongoing and future blood pump product line enhancements expected to meet patient needs across a broader spectrum of temporary heart assist applications 
our ab marketing efforts were initially focused on introducing the system in the largest cardiothoracic surgical centers through sales of consoles and blood pumps 
it is our intention to seek expansion of the current approved indications for use of the ab in order to allow support of expanded patient populations for longer periods of support 
the bvs and ab systems each consist of single use external blood pumps and cannulae and a reusable pneumatic drive and control console 
both are capable of assuming the full pumping function of a patient s failing heart  and are designed to provide either univentricular or biventricular support 
both are currently approved by the fda for temporary use while the patient s heart is allowed to rest  heal and recover 
the ab console is capable of controlling both the bvs and the ab blood pumps and ventricles and a patient can be switched from a bvs vad to an ab vad without surgery due to the compatible design of the cannulae used with the products 
our abiocor is a battery powered totally implantable replacement heart system  designed to operate without wires or any other material penetrating the patient s skin 
the company applied for initial fda market approval for the abiocor to treat a defined subset of irreversible end stage heart failure patients under a humanitarian device exemption hde 
this would allow implantation of the abiocor in up to  us patients a year 
as of june   the company is awaiting an fda decision on its hde application 
in may  we completed the acquisition of impella cardiosystems ag impella  located in aachen  germany 
impella manufactures  sells and supports the world s smallest  minimally invasive  high performance micro blood pumps with integrated motors and sensors for use in interventional cardiology and heart surgery 
impella s recover system pumps are designed to provide ventricle support for patients requiring hemodynamic stabilization  or suffering from reduced cardiac output and can potentially aid in recovering the hearts of patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction ami or heart attack 
impella has ce marks for four of its devices and currently markets them throughout europe 
we intend to seek fda approval to sell the impella recover system blood pumps in the united states as well as regulatory approval in other countries in order to address wider market opportunities for cardiac assist  recovery and replacement 
our operating results reflect the dual activities of commercial operations and investments in the research and development of new technologies 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuations and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab establishes the sec s view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
further  sab requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized 
in addition to sab  we follow the guidance of eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we derive our revenues primarily from product sales  including maintenance service agreements 
the great majority of our product revenues are derived from shipments of our ab and bvs product lines to fulfill customer orders for a specified number of consoles and or blood pumps for a specified price 
we recognize revenues and record costs related to such sales upon product shipment 
maintenance and service support contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
under contracts in which the company elects to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  the company prospectively recognizes revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as it incurs related research and development costs  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
intangibles 
the company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values and annual amortization expense from those established at the dates of acquisition 
the net book value of intangible assets at march  was approximately million 
goodwill 
the company periodically evaluates goodwill for impairment using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary 
the carrying amount of goodwill at march  was million 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
warranties 
our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and product recalls 
our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of product failures  including product recalls  exceeds our estimated warranty provision 
inventories 
we value our inventory of products held for sale at the lower of cost or current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down to its net realizable value any inventory believed to be impaired 
if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than projected demand  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely impact financial results for the period in which the additional excess or obsolete inventory is identified 
the inventory balances at march  and march   are net of accumulated impairment write downs of  and  respectively 
all of our inventories are related to our heart assist product line 
we will not capitalize any costs related to abiocor inventory until we receive regulatory approval to begin commercial sales 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  as of march   the company had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  that begin to expire in fiscal at march   the company also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that can be carried forward indefinitely 
the company also has federal and state research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  that begin to expire in fiscal we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that the company will be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax benefit  an adjustment to deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
stock based compensation 
in december the fasb issued a revised statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 share based payment fas r 
fas r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for annual fiscal periods beginning after june  through its fiscal year ended march   the company has followed apb no 
which does not require the recognition of compensation expense relating to the issuance of stock options so long as the quoted market price of the company s stock at the date of grant is less than or equal to the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
the original fas requires footnote disclosure only of pro forma net income as if a fair value based method had been used 
the company is transitioning on a modified prospective basis  and the adoption of sfas r effective with the fiscal quarter ended june  is expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  although management is still evaluating the exact impact 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs fas  which adopts wording from the international accounting standards board s iasb standard no 
 inventories  in an effort to improve the comparability of international financial reporting 
the statement is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues which includes revenues from products and funded research and development year ended march  revenues products funded research and development total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative expensed in process research and development amortization of intangibles total costs and expenses loss from operations other income  net loss before income taxes tax provision net loss fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal product revenues product revenues for the fiscal year ended march  increased by million or to million from million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase is primarily the result of the addition of impella product revenues since its acquisition in may and increased sales of consoles and ventricles in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year 
revenues for fiscal year from consoles  disposables  and service other programs increased  and  respectively compared to the same period of revenues from disposables  service and other programs comprised approximately of total revenues for fiscal year the higher revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal is due to the effects of the increased global distribution during fiscal versus fiscal as the company s sales and clinical team headcount was at the end of fiscal  up nearly since the end of fiscal these sales and clinical teams have been focused on increasing recovery awareness in the hospitals and open heart centers globally 
the increase in revenue during fiscal is a result of the increased global distribution and the recovery awareness programs with hospitals and centers merging clinical outcomes and reimbursement education to fuel demand for the company s products 
on october   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms increased reimbursement for the company s recovery vads to an average of  an increase of from prior levels  and now at the same level of reimbursement as transplant vads products sold by other device companies other than abiomed 
the company believes that this change in reimbursement  an increase in published recovery data using the company s products together with the increased global distribution teams generated the increase in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal the company expects to increase sales and clinical headcount in fiscal by two to four individuals per quarter and also plans to increase its service  marketing and training programs to continue to increase recovery awareness globally 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was or million for the fiscal year ended march  versus or million in fiscal the increase year over year is due primarily to inclusion of impella product cost of product revenues in fiscal year and increased costs of product revenues for our ab and bvs as we sold more of these products in fiscal compared to fiscal additionally  during fiscal the company recorded a non cash charge of approximately  primarily as a result of determining that certain inventory had no future net realizable value 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by million or to million in fiscal  from in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of including impella s research and development expense since its acquisition in may and also reflects our efforts to expand and enhance our product lines across a clinical spectrum of care in the cath lab and surgery suite 
during fiscal  the company invested in new product development to broaden its portfolio of products in the circulatory care markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march   from million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to the inclusion of impella expenses during fiscal year and also due to the company s strategy to increase its global distribution  specifically its global sales  service  marketing and clinical specialists organizations 
total global sales and clinical headcount at the end of fiscal year was compared to at the end of fiscal  representing an increase of 
expensed in process research and development the company recorded a million non cash charge to in process research and development expense during the quarter ended june  in connection with the company s acquisition of impella on may  this charge relates to costs to acquire in process research and development projects and technologies  which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of the business acquisition and have no alternative future use  and are expensed as incurred 
other income other income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and investments  foreign exchange gains  and other miscellaneous income 
other income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher investment income 
tax provision in  the company had no tax provision as it was in a loss position and it was more likely than not that the company would not recognize the benefit of the net operating losses 
as part of the impella acquisition in may of  the company obtained tax deductible goodwill amounting to million 
the difference between tax and financial statement cumulative amortization on tax deductible goodwill gives rise to a long term deferred tax liability of  this deferred tax liability cannot be used as a source of taxable income in the determination of the valuation allowance 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
based on expected future operating results  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
net loss during the fiscal year ended march  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share 
this compares to a net loss of million or per share for the prior fiscal year 
the million change in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to a million non cash in process research and development charge  increased sg a expenses of million as we expanded our global distribution  and an increase of million in research and development expenses as we drive a strategy to expand our product portfolio across a clinical spectrum 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we plan to invest in expanding our global distribution and also expect to incur costs to bring new products to market 
fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal product revenues product revenues increased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the improvement is attributable to increased sales of both our ab consoles and ventricles and our bvs disposable blood pumps 
a majority of the increased product sales were derived from our delivering a record number of ab systems and reorder ventricles during the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the product continuing to gain market acceptance as patient outcomes continued to improve with its wider use 
higher average unit selling prices for both products also contributed to approximately half the increased revenue performance during the past fiscal year 
our former european subsidiary  abiomed bv  set a company record for revenues during the fiscal year ending march  by increasing product revenues by  or million  over the prior year 
international product revenue from sources outside of europe also increased by during the fiscal year ended march  as a result of our efforts to establish and strengthen international distribution channels 
of the million in product revenues for the fiscal year ended march   approximately was derived from sales of ab ventricles and bvs disposable blood pumps 
as of march   we have a sales backorder and deferred revenues of approximately million  primarily as a result of our multi year customer service support contracts 
international sales accounted for of total product revenue during the fiscal years ended march  and cost of product revenues our costs of product revenues as a percentage of product revenue improved for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal due to higher volumes of product sold  specifically our ab and bvs products 
cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was  or million  for fiscal compared to  or million  in fiscal approximately of the improvement in margin is the result of higher average unit selling prices for our ab and bvs pumps in comparison to the prior fiscal year with the remainder in improvement coming from increased productivity in our manufacturing processes 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal research and development expenses were of total revenues for fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal the decrease is primarily as a result of shifting our labor and other costs to commercial bvs and ab manufacturing activities offset by increased development efforts on potential new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in the prior year to million in fiscal year ended march  the increases are primarily the result of labor  recruiting and relocation expenses incurred in connection with our adding new senior management earlier this fiscal year and expenses in connection with the sarbanes oxley compliance 
in addition  sales and marketing expenses increased significantly as a result of our efforts to expand our commercial operations both domestically and internationally 
other income other income consists primarily of interest earned on our investment balances  net of expenses and foreign exchange gains or losses 
other income was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to interest income representing better yields on investments offset by a reduction of the foreign translation gain 
net loss net loss for the fiscal year ended march  was approximately million  or per share 
this is a reduction from the net loss of approximately million  or per share  in the prior fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   our cash and investments totaled million compared to million in cash and investments at march  representing cash consumption of million 
this compares to million consumed for the year ended march  the cash utilization during fiscal was driven by our strategy to expand our product portfolio and global distribution 
during the fiscal year ended march   cash used by operating activities was million  as compared to million used by operations during the fiscal year ended march  the increased use of cash for the period is primarily driven by the net loss for the fiscal year of million 
this compares to a net loss of million in the prior fiscal year 
the net loss was offset by various non cash expenditures such as million for depreciation and amortization and a million write down of inventory primarily related to impella operations 
we also had a one time non cash expense of million for in process research and development related to the acquisition of impella 
the change in assets and liabilities was million  this net operating source of cash was primarily related to increases in accounts payable of million  accrued expenses of million and deferred revenues of million 
net cash flows from investing activities were million as net proceeds from the maturities of securities of million were offset by purchases of property and equipment of million and cash used to acquire impella including acquisition costs of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
we benefited from million in cash proceeds as a result of employee stock option exercises and employee participation in our stock purchase plan 
we believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  including funding the operating capital needs of impella  funding potential contingent cash payments to impella s former shareholders in accordance with the impella purchase agreement  the planned expenditures for our abiocor and abiocor ii implantable replacement hearts  and development and continued commercialization efforts for the bvs  ab and impella products  for at least the next twelve months 
during fiscal  the company expects to spend approximately million to million in research and development expenses  and expects capital expenditures to be approximately million to million 
the us phase of our erp sap implementation is expected to be completed during our fiscal year ended at a total estimated cost of million  of which the company has already spent approximately million in fiscal we may need additional funds for possible strategic acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies complementary to our business  including their subsequent integration into our operations 
if additional funds are required and available in the debt and equity markets  we may raise such funds from time to time through public or private sales of equity or from borrowings 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table in thousands summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total operating lease obligations other obligations total obligations the company has no long term debt or material commitments at march  other than those shown in the table above 
in may  the company acquired all the shares of outstanding capital stock of impella cardiosystems  a company headquartered in aachen  germany 
the aggregate purchase price was approximately million  which consisted of million of our common stock  million of cash paid to certain former shareholders of impella  and million of transaction costs  consisting primarily of fees paid for financial advisory and legal services 
we may make additional contingent payments to impella s former shareholders based on our future stock price performance and additional milestone payments related to fda approvals and unit sales of impella products 
these contingent payments range from zero dollars to approximately million and  if necessary  may be made in a combination of cash or stock under circumstances described in the purchase agreement 
if any contingent payments are made  they will result in an increase to the carrying value of goodwill 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation expands the disclosure requirements of guarantee obligations and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation assumed under a guarantee 
in general  fin no 
applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
we apply the disclosure provisions of fin to agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
these disclosure provisions expand those required by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  by requiring that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance is remote 
the following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor 
product warranties we routinely accrue for estimated future warranty costs on our product sales at the time of sale 
the ab and bvs products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates 
operating results could be adversely effected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision 
patent indemnifications in many sales transactions  the company indemnifies customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by our products 
the indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims 
the company has never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales transactions 
under the provisions of fin no 
 intellectual property indemnifications require disclosure only 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rates while we do not invest for speculative purposes  we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our investment portfolio consists mainly of us treasury notes  federal agency obligations  state and municipal bonds  and corporate bonds with maturities of one year or less and ratings of at least aa by moody s or standard poor s 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial 
we believe  however  that we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected by a change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
currency exchange rates our impella subsidiary s functional currency is the euro 
therefore  our investment in impella is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders equity 
had a depreciation in the euro occurred relative to the us dollar as of march   the result would have been a reduction of shareholders equity of million
