item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and included in other portions of this report 
overview the company as of december   we owned correctional  detention and juvenile facilities  three of which we lease to other operators 
we currently operate facilities  with a total design capacity of approximately  beds in states and the district of columbia 
we are the nation s largest owner and operator of privatized correctional and detention facilities and one of the largest prison operators in the united states behind only the federal government and three states 
our size and experience provide us with significant credibility with our current and prospective customers  and enables us to generate economies of scale in purchasing power for food services  health care and other supplies and services we offer to our customers 
we are compensated for operating and managing prisons and correctional facilities at an inmate per diem rate based upon actual or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels 
the significant expansion of the prison population in the united states has led to overcrowding in the state and federal prison systems  providing us with opportunities for growth 
federal  state  and local governments may experience budgetary constraints putting pressure on governments to control correctional budgets  including per diem rates our customers pay to us 
although budgetary constraints have been somewhat alleviated recently  governments continue to experience constrained correctional budgets putting pressure on their ability to construct new beds 
we believe the outsourcing of prison management services to private operators allows governments to manage increasing inmate populations while simultaneously controlling correctional costs and improving correctional services 
we believe our customers discover that partnering with private operators to provide residential services to their inmates introduces competition to their prison system  resulting in improvements to the quality and cost of corrections services throughout their correctional system 
further  the use of facilities owned and managed by private operators allows governments to expand prison capacity without incurring large capital commitments required to increase correctional capacity 
we also believe that having beds immediately available to our customers provides us with a distinct competitive advantage when bidding on new contracts 
while we have been successful in winning contract awards to provide management services for facilities we do not own  and will continue to pursue such management contracts  we believe the most significant opportunities for growth are in providing our government partners with available beds within facilities we currently own or develop 
we also believe that owning the facilities in which we provide management services enables us to more rapidly replace business lost compared with managed only facilities  since we can offer the same beds to new and existing customers and  with customer consent  may have more flexibility in moving our existing inmate populations to facilities with available capacity 
all of our management contracts generally provide our customers with the right to terminate our management contracts at any time without cause 
we currently have three correctional facilities  our stewart county correctional facility  our north fork correctional facility  and our t 
don hutto correctional center  which are substantially vacant 
table of contents and provide us with approximately  available beds 
during december  we reached an agreement with the us immigration and customs enforcement  or the ice  to manage up to detainees at our t 
don hutto correctional center in taylor  texas 
we have not yet begun to receive detainees pursuant to this contract and are currently in discussions with the ice regarding the nature and timing of the receipt of detainees from the ice 
we also have two additional facilities located in eloy  arizona  which are under construction 
the red rock correctional center will provide approximately  additional beds during the third quarter of and the saguaro correctional facility is expected to bring approximately  additional beds on line during the second half of we expect that both of these facilities will be used primarily for our existing customers 
in addition to these five facilities  which will provide an aggregate of approximately  available beds  as of december   our crowley county correctional facility had approximately beds available  which we expect to be substantially filled with inmates from the state of colorado  providing further potential for increased cash flow 
as a result of the completion of numerous recapitalization and refinancing transactions over the past several years  we have significantly reduced our exposure to variable rate debt  substantially eliminated our subordinated indebtedness  lowered our after tax interest obligations associated with our outstanding debt  further increasing our cash flow  and extended our total weighted average debt maturities 
also as a result of the completion of these capital transactions  covenants under our senior bank credit facility were amended to provide greater flexibility for  among other matters  incurring unsecured indebtedness  capital expenditures  and permitted acquisitions 
with the most recent pay off of our senior bank credit facility in january and the completion of our new revolving credit facility in february  we removed the requirement to secure the senior bank credit facility with liens on our real estate assets and  instead  collateralized the facility primarily with security interests in our accounts receivable and deposit accounts 
we also expanded our borrowing capacity with the new revolving credit facility 
standard and poor s currently rates our senior unsecured debt as bb 
moody s investors service currently rates our senior unsecured debt as ba as previously described  we are utilizing this financial flexibility and liquidity to increase our capacity for sustained growth 
we are also focusing our efforts on containing our costs 
while we have been successful in reducing our variable expenses primarily by taking advantage of our purchasing power  and will strive for continued progress in this area  we believe the largest opportunity for further reducing our facility operating expenses is through the implementation of a franchise approach to staffing and business practices and through investments in technology 
approximately of our operating expenses consist of salaries and benefits 
containing these expenses will continue to be challenging 
further  the turnover rate for correctional officers for our company  and for the corrections industry in general  remains high  and medical benefits for our employees continue to increase primarily as a result of continued rising healthcare costs throughout the country 
unlike the savings reaped in our variable operating expenses  reducing these staffing costs requires a long term strategy to control such costs 
most recently  we have created numerous multi departmental teams to perform individual facility reviews with a focus on improving employee stability and consistency in the delivery of our correctional services 
we also continue to make investments in technology  many of which are unique and new to the corrections industry  which we believe can enable us to operate safe and secure facilities with more efficient  highly skilled and better trained staff  and to reduce turnover 
through the combination of our business development initiatives to increase our revenues by taking advantage of our available beds while maintaining an adequate supply of new beds  and our strategies to generate savings and to contain our operating expenses  we believe we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage and continue to improve the quality services we provide to our customers at an economical price  thereby producing value to our stockholders 

table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is described in note to our audited financial statements 
the significant accounting policies and estimates which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following asset impairments 
as of december   we had billion in long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying values of our long lived assets  other than goodwill  when events suggest that an impairment may have occurred 
in these circumstances  we utilize estimates of undiscounted cash flows to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment exists  it is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
goodwill impairments 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  establishes accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is determined using a collaboration of various common valuation techniques  including market multiples  discounted cash flows  and replacement cost methods 
these impairment tests are required to be performed at least annually 
we perform our impairment tests during the fourth quarter  in connection with our annual budgeting process  and whenever circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas generally requires us to record deferred income taxes for the tax effect of differences between book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes reflect the available net operating losses and the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of our deferred tax assets  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
prior to the year ended december   we provided a valuation allowance to substantially reserve our deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas however  at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas  the valuation allowance applied to such deferred tax assets was reversed 
removal of the valuation allowance resulted in a significant non cash reduction in income tax expense 
in addition  because a portion of the previously recorded valuation allowance was established to reserve certain deferred tax assets upon the acquisitions of two service companies during  in accordance with sfas  removal of the valuation allowance resulted in a reduction to the remaining goodwill recorded in connection with such acquisitions to the extent the reversal related to the valuation allowance applied to deferred tax assets existing at the date the service companies were acquired 
in addition  removal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase in our additional 
table of contents paid in capital related to the tax benefits of exercises of employee stock options and of grants of restricted stock 
the reduction to goodwill amounted to million  while additional paid in capital increased million 
during  the internal revenue service the irs completed its field audit of our federal income tax return 
during the fourth quarter of  the audit results underwent a review by the joint committee on taxation 
based on that review  the irs adjusted the carryback claims we filed on our and federal income tax returns  requiring us to repay approximately million of refunds we received during and as a result of tax law changes provided by the job creation and worker assistance act of a portion of our tax loss was deemed not to be available for carryback to and due to our restructuring that occurred between and however  we will carry this tax loss forward to offset future taxable income 
while the adjustment did not result in a loss of deductions claimed  we were obligated to repay the amount of the adjusted refund  plus interest of approximately million  or million after taxes  through december  these obligations were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of december  during  we successfully disputed a portion of the repayment  resulting in a reduction to the repayment by approximately million and reducing the related interest accrued during our obligations pertaining to this audit were paid in as of december   we expected to utilize our remaining federal net operating losses in however  deductible expenses associated with debt refinancing transactions completed during march resulted in a decrease in our estimate of taxable income to be generated in  such that we now do not expect to fully utilize our remaining federal net operating losses until although we now expect to utilize our remaining federal net operating losses in  we have approximately million in net operating losses applicable to various states that we expect to carry forward in future years to offset taxable income in such states 
certain of these net operating losses have begun to expire 
accordingly  we have a valuation allowance of million for the estimated amount of the net operating losses that will expire unused  in addition to a million valuation allowance related to state tax credits that are also expected to expire unused 
although our estimate of future taxable income is based on current assumptions we believe to be reasonable  our assumptions may prove inaccurate and could change in the future  which could result in the expiration of additional net operating losses or credits 
we would be required to establish a valuation allowance at such time that we no longer expected to utilize these net operating losses or credits  which could result in a material impact on our results of operations in the future 
self funded insurance reserves 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in accrued liabilities for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile insurance claims 
we are significantly self insured for employee health  workers compensation  and automobile liability insurance claims 
as such  our insurance expense is largely dependent on claims experience and our ability to control our claims 
we have consistently accrued the estimated liability for employee health insurance claims based on our history of claims experience and the time lag between the incident date and the date the cost is paid by us 
we have accrued the estimated liability for workers compensation and automobile insurance claims based on a third party actuarial valuation of the outstanding liabilities 
these estimates could change in the future 
it is possible that future cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our strategies 
legal reserves 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in accrued liabilities related to certain legal proceedings in which we are involved 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims based on a range of potential outcomes 
in addition  we are subject to current and potential future legal proceedings for which little or no accrual has been reflected because our current assessment of the potential exposure is 
table of contents nominal 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with our general counsel s office and  as appropriate  outside counsel handling these matters  and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that future cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our strategies 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the years ended december    and  the number of facilities we owned and managed  the number of facilities we managed but did not own  the number of facilities we leased to other operators  and the facilities we owned that were not yet in operation 
owned and managed effective date managed only leased incomplete total facilities as of december  management contracts awarded by the texas department of criminal justice  net january  management contract awarded for the delta correctional facility april  expiration of the management contract for the tall trees facility august  expiration of the management contract for the southern nevada women s correctional center october  facilities as of december  expiration of the management contract for the david l 
moss criminal justice center july  completion of construction at the stewart county correctional facility october  facilities as of december  we also have two additional facilities located in eloy  arizona that are under construction 
these facilities are not counted in the foregoing table because they currently have no impact on our results of operations 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we generated net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  compared with net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the previous year 
contributing to the net income for compared to the previous year was an increase in operating income of million  from million during to million during as a result of an increase in occupancy levels and new management contracts  partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization 
net income available to common stockholders during was negatively impacted by a million pre tax charge  or per diluted share net of taxes  associated with debt refinancing transactions completed during the first and second quarters  as further described hereafter 
the charge consisted of a tender premium paid to the holders of the senior notes who tendered their notes to us at a 
table of contents price of of par pursuant to a tender offer we made for the senior notes in march  estimated fees and expenses associated with the tender offer  and the write off of i existing deferred loan costs associated with the purchase of the senior notes  ii existing deferred loan costs associated with a lump sum pay down of our senior bank credit facility  and iii existing deferred loan costs and third party fees incurred in connection with obtaining an amendment to our old senior bank credit facility 
facility operations a key performance indicator we use to measure the revenue and expenses associated with the operation of the facilities we own or manage is expressed in terms of a compensated man day  and represents the revenue we generate and expenses we incur for one inmate for one calendar day 
revenue and expenses per compensated man day are computed by dividing facility revenue and expenses by the total number of compensated man days during the period 
a compensated man day represents a calendar day for which we are paid for the occupancy of an inmate 
we believe the measurement is useful because we are compensated for operating and managing facilities at an inmate per diem rate based upon actual or minimum guaranteed occupancy levels 
we also measure our ability to contain costs on a per compensated man day basis  which is largely dependent upon the number of inmates we accommodate 
further  per man day measurements are also used to estimate our potential profitability based on certain occupancy levels relative to design capacity 
revenue and expenses per compensated man day for all of the facilities we owned or managed  exclusive of those discontinued see further discussion below regarding discontinued operations  were as follows for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy average compensated occupancy for the year ended december  decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of the completion of construction of approximately  beds at seven facilities throughout the second half of and the first quarter of in addition  we evaluate the design capacity of our facilities from time to time based on the customers using the facilities and the ability to reconfigure space with minimal capital outlays 
in connection with the preparation of the budget  we increased the previously reported design capacities by an aggregate of approximately  beds effective january  excluding these design capacity changes  as well as similar design capacity changes made during the third quarter of  compensated occupancy would have been for the year ended december  business from our federal customers  including the bureau of prisons  or the bop  the united states marshals service  or the usms  and the ice  continues to be a significant component of our business 
our federal customers generated and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents operating expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of adult and juvenile correctional and detention facilities  and for our inmate transportation subsidiary 
salaries and benefits represent the most significant component of fixed operating expenses with approximately of our operating expenses consisting of salaries and benefits 
during  salaries and benefits expense at our correctional and detention facilities increased million from salaries have increased as a result of annual raises  the commencement of management operations at the delta correctional facility and the northeast ohio correctional center in april  and an increase in staffing levels as a result of the arrival of additional inmate populations at the northeast ohio correctional center resulting from the commencement of a new contract with the bop in june  and at several facilities where expansions have been completed 
in addition  temporary reductions in inmate populations at several other facilities  mostly during the first half of  did not justify a decrease in staffing levels at such facilities  resulting in an increase in salaries per compensated man day  as these fixed expenses were spread over fewer compensated man days 
these increases were mitigated by successful cost containment efforts in employee medical and workers compensation expenses across the portfolio 
facility variable expenses increased from per compensated man day during to per compensated man day during the increase in facility variable expenses was primarily the result of general inflationary increases in the costs of services such as our food service and inmate medical expenses  partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to legal proceedings in which we are involved 
we have recently been successful at settling certain legal proceedings in which we are involved on terms we believe are favorable 
during  we settled a number of outstanding legal matters for amounts less than reserves previously established for such matters  which resulted in a reduction to operating expenses of approximately million during compared with expenses associated with legal proceedings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on changes in our assumptions  new developments  or by the effectiveness of our litigation and settlement strategies 
our recent success in settling outstanding claims at amounts less than previously reserved is not likely to be sustained for the long term and it is possible that future cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected by increases in expenses associated with legal matters in which we become involved 
the operation of the facilities we own carries a higher degree of risk associated with a management contract than the operation of the facilities we manage but do not own because we incur significant capital expenditures to construct or acquire facilities we own 
additionally  correctional and detention facilities have a limited or no alternative use 
therefore  if a management contract is terminated at a facility we own  we continue to incur certain operating expenses  such as real estate taxes  utilities  and insurance  that we would not incur if a management contract was terminated for a managed only facility 
as a result  revenue per compensated man day is typically higher for facilities we own and manage than for managed only facilities 
because we incur higher expenses  such as repairs and maintenance  real estate taxes  and insurance  on the facilities we own and manage  our cost structure for facilities we own and manage is also higher than the cost structure for the managed only facilities 
the following tables display the revenue and expenses per compensated man day for the facilities we own and manage and for the facilities we manage but do not own 
table of contents for the years ended december  owned and managed facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy managed only facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy the following discussions under owned and managed facilities and managed only facilities address significant events that impacted our results of operations for the respective periods  and events that will affect our results of operations in the future 
owned and managed facilities on april   we announced that we resumed operations at our  bed northeast ohio correctional center located in youngstown  ohio 
since then  we have managed federal prisoners from united states federal court districts that have been experiencing a lack of detention space and or high detention costs 
as of december   we housed usms prisoners at this facility compared with usms prisoners at the facility as of december  the operating revenues for were million  while operating expenses were million for at this facility partially as a result of start up activities and for staffing expenses in preparation for the arrival of additional inmates at this facility 
prior to being awarded the contract with the usms  this facility had been idle since we believed that re opening this facility put us in a competitive position to win contract awards for the utilization of the facility 
on december   we received a contract award from the bop to house approximately  bop inmates at our northeast ohio correctional center 
the contract  awarded as part of the criminal alien requirement phase solicitation car  provides for an initial four year term with three two year renewal options 
the terms of the contract provide for a guaranteed rate of occupancy for days following commencement of the contract and a guaranteed rate of occupancy thereafter 
the contract commenced june  as of december   we housed  bop inmates at this facility 
total revenue increased by million during compared with as a result of this new contract and from an increase in usms prisoners at this facility 

table of contents during july  an inmate disturbance at the crowley county correctional facility located in olney springs  colorado resulted in damage to the facility  requiring us to transfer a substantial portion of the inmates to other of our facilities and to facilities owned by the state of colorado 
although repair of the facility was substantially complete at december   colorado continued to reduce inmate populations at all four of our facilities in colorado to as low as  in november however  the impact was mitigated by the recovery of million of business interruption and other insurance proceeds recognized during the first quarter of as of december   we housed  inmates at this facility  compared with inmates at december   despite a relocation of inmates during from the state of washington to our prairie correctional facility  largely due to an expansion of the crowley facility by beds completed during the third quarter of our overall inmate populations from the state of colorado have also recovered 
we housed  inmates from the state of colorado as of december   compared with  inmates just prior to the inmate disturbance at the crowley facility 
as a result of the completion of bed expansions at our houston processing center and our leavenworth detention center during the fourth quarter of  total revenue increased during from by a combined million 
we expanded the houston processing center by beds  from a design capacity of beds to beds  in connection with a new contract with ice to accommodate additional detainee populations that were anticipated as a result of this contract  which contains a guarantee that ice will utilize beds 
we expanded the leavenworth detention center by beds  from a design capacity of beds to beds  in connection with a new contract with the usms 
the new usms contract provides a guarantee that the usms will utilize beds 
during the second quarter of  the state of indiana removed all of its inmates from our bed otter creek correctional facility to utilize available capacity within the state s correctional system 
all of the indiana inmates were transferred to the state of indiana by the end of the second quarter of however  during july  we entered into an agreement with the kentucky department of corrections to manage up to female inmates at this facility 
the terms of the contract include an initial two year period  with four two year renewal options 
beginning july   the state of kentucky guarantees an inmate population from any state of of the facility design capacity  subject to appropriation 
we began receiving these inmates in august as of december   we housed kentucky inmates at this facility 
during october  we entered into an agreement with the state of hawaii to house up to female hawaii inmates at the otter creek correctional center 
the terms of the contract include an initial one year period  with two one year renewal options 
the facility began receiving hawaii inmates during september under a day contract completed in september as of december   we housed hawaii inmates at this facility 
we anticipate the existing customers at this facility will fill the remaining space vacated by indiana but can provide no such assurance 
operating income decreased at this facility by million during compared to as a result of declining inmate populations from the usms and ice at our  bed san diego correctional facility  total revenues decreased by million during compared with the average compensated occupancy during and was and  respectively 
however  effective july   the ice awarded us a contract for the continued management at this facility 
the contract  which governs the management of both usms and ice inmates  has a three year base term with five three year renewal options  and includes a guaranteed inmate population of ice detainees and usms inmates 
the san diego correctional facility is subject to a ground lease with the county of san diego 
under the provisions of the lease  the facility is divided into three different properties initial  existing and expansion premises  all of which have separate terms ranging from june to december  
table of contents subject to extension by the county 
upon expiration of any lease term  ownership of the applicable portion of the facility automatically reverts to the county 
the county has the right to buy out the initial and expansion portions of the facility at various times prior to the end term of the ground lease at a price generally equal to the cost of the premises  less an allowance for the amortization over a year period 
the third portion existing premises includes beds at a current annual rent of approximately million and expires in june the county may elect to extend that portion of the lease to  but extension of the lease beyond june is at the sole discretion of the county 
ownership of the bed expansion premises reverts to the county in december the company is currently negotiating with the county to extend the reversion date of the expansion premises  or to provide the county with alternate beds to meet their demand 
however  if we are unsuccessful  we may be required to relocate a portion of the existing federal inmate population to other available beds within or outside the san diego correctional facility  which could include the acquisition of an alternate site for the construction of a new facility 
during  the state of wisconsin reduced the number of inmates housed at both our  bed diamondback correctional facility and our  bed prairie correctional facility  by opening various facilities owned by the state 
as discussed hereafter  the available beds at diamondback correctional facility  which resulted from the declining inmate population from the state of wisconsin  have been filled with inmates from the state of arizona 
the average daily inmate population housed from the state of wisconsin at our prairie correctional facility declined from inmates during to inmates during the reduction in inmate populations from the state of wisconsin were offset by an increase in inmate populations from the states of washington and minnesota at the prairie facility resulting from new management contract awards from those states in mid in addition  during october  we entered into a new agreement with the state of idaho to house a portion of that state s male  medium security inmates at our prairie correctional facility 
at december   we managed approximately  male inmates for idaho at our idaho correctional facility located in boise  idaho 
under the new agreement with the idaho department of corrections  we will manage an estimated inmates at the prairie facility 
as of december   the prairie facility housed approximately  male inmates from the states of minnesota  washington  north dakota  and idaho 
while the replacement of wisconsin inmates with inmates from the states of minnesota  washington  and idaho had an immaterial impact on operating income of the prairie correctional facility during compared with  we currently expect profitability to increase at this facility during  as a result of the ramp up of inmate populations from these various states throughout on march   we announced that we entered into an agreement with the state of arizona to manage up to  arizona inmates at our diamondback correctional facility 
the agreement represents the first time the state has partnered with us to provide residential services to its inmates 
as of december  and  the facility housed approximately  and inmates  respectively  from the state of arizona contributing to an increase of million in total revenues at this facility in compared with the prior year 
during july  we announced our intention to cease operations at our t 
don hutto correctional center located in taylor  texas  effective early september however during the fourth quarter of  the facility housed inmates from the liberty county jail we manage in liberty  texas on a temporary basis due to the effects of hurricane rita on the liberty county jail 
although the liberty county jail sustained no property damage  inmates were held in the t 
don hutto correctional center until power and other services were restored at the liberty county jail 
additionally  on october   we agreed to provide temporary housing for approximately  detainees from the ice housed in government detention facilities throughout the state of florida due to the anticipated arrival of hurricane wilma and the emergency evacuation of all detainees in florida 
we initially housed 
table of contents approximately detainees at our t 
don hutto correctional center and approximately detainees at our florence correctional center 
these detainee populations were returned to florida during december during december  we reached an agreement with the ice to manage up to detainees at the t 
don hutto correctional center that will allow the facility to remain open indefinitely 
we have not yet begun to receive detainees pursuant to this contract and are currently in discussions with the ice regarding the nature and timing of the receipt of detainees from the ice 
total revenue and operating expenses were million and million  respectively  during  compared with total revenue and operating expenses of million and million  respectively  during during january  we received notification from the bop of its intent not to exercise its renewal option at our  bed eloy detention center  located in eloy  arizona 
at december   the eloy facility housed approximately inmates from the bop and approximately detainees from the ice  pursuant to a subcontract between the bop and the ice 
the bop completed the transfer of its inmates from the eloy facility to other bop facilities by february  during february  we reached an agreement with the city of eloy to manage detainees from the ice at this facility under an inter governmental service agreement between the city of eloy and the ice  effectively providing the ice the ability to fully utilize eloy detention center for existing and potential future requirements 
under our agreement with the city of eloy  we are eligible for periodic rate increases  that were not provided in the existing contract with the bop 
although the contract does not provide for a guaranteed occupancy  we expect over time that the facility will be substantially occupied by the ice detainees 
during september  we announced our intention to complete construction of the stewart county correctional facility located in stewart county  georgia 
construction on the  bed stewart county correctional facility began in august and was suspended in may our decision to complete construction of this facility was based on anticipated demand from several government customers having a need for inmate bed capacity in the southeast region of the country 
during october  construction was completed and the facility was available for occupancy 
accordingly  we began depreciating the new facility in the fourth quarter of and ceased capitalizing interest on this project 
during and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  in interest costs incurred on this facility 
the book value of the facility was approximately million upon completion of construction 
because we currently do not have a contract to house inmates at this facility  our overall occupancy percentage will also be negatively impacted as a result of the additional vacant beds available at the stewart facility 
although we are optimistic that we will begin utilizing these available beds some time during  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in utilizing the increased bed capacity 
managed only facilities our operating margins declined at managed only facilities from during to during primarily as a result of declines in inmate populations at the  bed bay county jail located in panama city  florida and the  bed metro davidson county detention facility located in nashville  tennessee 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in inmate populations at the newly expanded lake city correctional facility located in lake city  florida  particularly during the second and third quarters of primarily as a result of declines in inmate populations at the bay county jail and the metro davidson county detention facility  total revenue decreased during from the comparable periods in by a combined million 
the decline in occupancy at the metro davidson county detention 
table of contents facility is the result of the loss of female inmates at the facility caused by the opening of a new female only detention facility by davidson county during the first quarter of on march   we announced the completion of a contractual agreement with mississippi s delta correctional authority to resume operations of the state owned  bed delta correctional facility located in greenwood  mississippi 
we managed the medium security correctional facility for the delta correctional authority since its opening in until the state closed the facility in  due to excess capacity in the state s corrections system 
the initial contract was for one year  with one two year extension option 
we began receiving inmates from the state of mississippi at the facility on april  in addition  after completing the contractual agreement with the delta correctional authority  we entered into an additional contract to manage inmates from leflore county  mississippi 
this one year contract provides for housing for up to male inmates and up to female inmates  and is renewable annually 
as of december   we housed and inmates from the state of mississippi and leflore county  respectively 
effective july   the florida department of management services dms  or the florida dms  awarded us contract extensions for three medium security correctional facilities we manage on behalf of the state of florida 
accordingly  we expect to continue management operations of the bed bay correctional facility in panama city  florida  the  bed gadsden correctional institution in quincy  florida  and the recently expanded bed lake city correctional facility in lake city  florida 
the management contracts at bay correctional facility and gadsden correctional institution were renewed for a period of two years 
the management contract at lake city correctional facility was renewed for a one year term 
during november  the dms solicited proposals for the management of the lake city correctional facility beginning july  we have responded to the proposal  but can provide no assurance that we will be awarded a contract for our continued management of the facility  or that we can maintain current per diem rates 
if we are not awarded the management contract  we would be required to report a non cash charge for the impairment of tangible and intangible assets of approximately million 
in december  the florida dms announced we were awarded the project to design  construct  and operate expansions at the bay correctional facility by beds and the gadsden facility by beds 
both of these expansions will be funded by the state of florida and construction is expected to be complete during the second or third quarter of during october  hernando county  florida completed an expansion by beds of the bed hernando county jail we manage in brooksville  florida  which we expect to contribute to an increase in revenue in the future 
during june  bay county  florida solicited proposals for the management of the bay county jail beginning october  we have responded to the proposal and were notified by bay county in january of their intent to select us to negotiate for the continued management and construction of both new and replacement beds at the facility  but can provide no assurance that we will be awarded a contract for our continued management of the facility  or that we can maintain current per diem rates 
the construction of the new and replacement beds at the facility is expected to be paid by bay county at a fixed price to be negotiated in the new contract 
if we are not awarded the management contract  we would be required to report a non cash charge for the impairment of tangible and intangible assets of approximately million 
general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and  general and administrative expenses totaled million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of 
table of contents corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses  and increased from primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and benefits  combined with an increase in professional services during compared with also  the increase attributable to salaries and benefits was caused in part by the recognition of restricted stock based compensation of million during awarded to employees who have historically been awarded stock options  and an additional million for a charge associated with the acceleration of vesting effective december  of all outstanding stock options 
in  the company made changes to its historical business practices with respect to awarding stock based employee compensation as a result of  among other reasons  the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
during the year ending december   we recognized million of general and administrative expense for the amortization of restricted stock issued during to employees whose compensation is charged to general and administrative expense 
because these employees have historically been granted stock options rather than restricted stock  no such expense was recognized in our statement of operations during as a result  the issuance of restricted stock rather than stock options to these employees will contribute to a significant increase in our reported general and administrative expenses  even though our overall financial position and total cash flows are not affected by this change in compensation philosophy 
this increase is currently expected to be exacerbated in  when general and administrative expense will include the amortization of restricted stock granted to these employees in both and  since the amortization period spans the three year vesting period of the restricted shares 
further  on january   we also expect to begin recognizing general and administrative expenses for the amortization of employee stock options granted after january   to employees whose compensation is charged to general and administrative expense  which heretofore have not been recognized in our income statement  except with respect to the aforementioned compensation charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter of for the acceleration of vesting of outstanding options as further described hereafter 
effective december   our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of outstanding options previously awarded to executive officers and employees under our amended and restated employee share incentive plan and our amended and restated stock incentive plan 
as a result of the acceleration  approximately  unvested options became exercisable  of which were scheduled to vest in february the purpose of the accelerated vesting of stock options was to enable us to avoid recognizing compensation expense associated with these options in future periods as required by sfas r  which we were required to adopt by january  we expect to reduce the non cash  pre tax compensation expense that we would otherwise be required to recognize in our financial statements by an estimated million in  million in  and million in in order to prevent unintended benefits to the holders of these stock options  we imposed resale restrictions to prevent the sale of any shares acquired from the exercise of an accelerated option prior to the original vesting date of the option 
the resale restrictions automatically expire upon the individual s termination of employment 
all other terms and conditions applicable to such options  including the exercise prices  remained unchanged 
as a result of the acceleration  we recognized a non cash  pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of for the estimated value of the stock options that would have otherwise been forfeited 
our general and administrative expenses were also higher as a result of an increase in corporate staffing levels 
in response to a number of inmate disturbances experienced during  we re evaluated our organizational structure and expanded our infrastructure to help ensure the quality and effectiveness of our facility operations 
we have also expanded our infrastructure to implement and support numerous technology initiatives that we believe will provide long term benefits enabling us to provide enhanced quality service to our customers while creating scalable efficiencies 
this intensified focus on quality assurance and technology has contributed  and is expected to continue to contribute  to 
table of contents an increase in salaries and benefits expense  as well as a number of other general and administrative expense categories 
we have also experienced increasing expenses to comply with increasing corporate governance requirements  a significant portion of which was incurred to continue to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we also continue to evaluate the potential need to expand our corporate office infrastructure to improve outreach and oversight of our facility operations to reduce turnover and improve facility performance 
these initiatives could also lead to higher general and administrative expenses in the future 
depreciation and amortization for the years ended december  and  depreciation and amortization expense totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization from resulted from the combination of additional depreciation expense recorded on the various facility expansion and development projects completed and the additional depreciation on our investments in technology 
the investments in technology are expected to provide long term benefits enabling us to provide enhanced quality service to our customers while creating scalable operating efficiencies 
interest expense  net interest expense was reported net of interest income and capitalized interest for the years ended december  and gross interest expense  net of capitalized interest  was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest expense during these periods is based on outstanding borrowings under our senior bank credit facility  senior notes until fully tendered  senior notes  senior notes  convertible subordinated notes payable balances until converted  and amortization of loan costs and unused credit facility fees 
the decrease in gross interest expense from the prior year was primarily attributable to the recapitalization and refinancing transactions completed during the first half of partially offset by an increasing interest rate environment as applicable to the variable interest rates on our senior bank credit facility 
gross interest income was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest income is earned on cash collateral requirements  a direct financing lease  notes receivable  investments  and cash and cash equivalents 
capitalized interest was million and million during and  respectively  and was associated with various construction and expansion projects 
expenses associated with debt refinancing and recapitalization transactions for the years ended december  and  expenses associated with debt refinancing and recapitalization transactions were million and million  respectively 
the charges in the first quarter of consisted primarily of i a tender premium paid to the holders of the million senior notes who tendered their notes to us at a price of of par pursuant to a tender offer for the notes in march  ii the write off of existing deferred loan costs associated with the purchase of the million senior notes and lump sum pay down of the term portion of our senior bank credit facility made with the proceeds from the issuance of million senior notes  and iii estimated fees and expenses associated with each of the foregoing transactions 
the charges in the second quarter of consisted of the write off of existing deferred loan costs and third party fees and expenses associated with an amendment to the senior bank credit facility  as further described hereafter 

table of contents the charges in were associated with the redemption of the remaining series a preferred stock in the first quarter of and the redemption of the remaining series b preferred stock in the second quarter of  as well as third party fees associated with the amendment to our senior bank credit facility obtained during the second quarter of income tax expense during the years ended december  and  our financial statements reflected an income tax provision of million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate was approximately during the year ended december  compared to approximately during the year ended december  the lower effective tax rate during resulted from certain tax planning strategies implemented during the fourth quarter of  that were magnified by the recognition of deductible expenses associated with our debt refinancing transactions completed during the first half of in addition  we also successfully pursued and recognized investment tax credits of million during our overall effective tax rate is estimated based on our current projection of taxable income and could change in the future as a result of changes in these estimates  the implementation of additional tax strategies  changes in federal or state tax rates  or changes in state apportionment factors  as well as changes in the valuation allowance applied to our deferred tax assets that are based primarily on the amount of state net operating losses and tax credits that could expire unused 
discontinued operations on march   we were notified by the department of corrections of the commonwealth of virginia of its intention to not renew our contract to manage the  bed lawrenceville correctional center located in lawrenceville  virginia  upon the expiration of the contract  which occurred on march  results for include residual activity from the operation of this facility  including primarily proceeds received from the sale of fully depreciated equipment 
these results are reported as discontinued operations 
during the first quarter of  we received million in proceeds from the commonwealth of puerto rico as a settlement for repairs we previously made to a facility we formerly operated in ponce  puerto rico 
these proceeds  net of taxes  are presented as discontinued operations for year ended december  due to operating losses incurred at the southern nevada women s correctional center  we elected to not renew our contract to manage the facility upon the expiration of the contract 
accordingly  we transferred operation of the facility to the nevada department of corrections on october  during  the facility generated total revenue of million and incurred total operating expenses of million 
on march   the tulsa county commission in oklahoma provided us notice that  as a result of a contract bidding process  the county elected to have the tulsa county sheriff s office assume management of the david l 
moss criminal justice center upon expiration of the contract on june  operations were transferred to the sheriff s office on july  total revenue and operating expenses during were million and million  respectively  compared with total revenue and operating expenses during of million and million  respectively 

table of contents distributions to preferred stockholders for the year ended december   distributions to preferred stockholders totaled million 
during the first quarter of  we redeemed the remaining million outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock at a price of per share  plus accrued dividends to the redemption date 
further  during the second quarter of  we redeemed the remaining million outstanding shares of our series b preferred stock at a price of per share  plus accrued dividends to the redemption date 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the year ended december   we generated net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  compared with net income available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the previous year 
contributing to the net income for compared to the previous year was an increase in operating income of million  from million during to million during as a result of an increase in occupancy levels and new management contracts  partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses 
net income available to common stockholders was negatively impacted during as compared to as a result of the recognition of an income tax provision in accordance with sfas during  amounting to million  or per diluted share  compared with an income tax benefit of million  or per diluted share during the income tax benefit during was primarily the result of our reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax assets 
net income available to common stockholders during was favorably impacted by the refinancing and recapitalization transactions completed during the second and third quarters of these transactions included the issuance of million shares of common stock at a price of per share  along with the issuances of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the proceeds from these issuances were used to i purchase million shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of our million convertible subordinated notes with a stated rate of plus contingent interest accrued at and to pay accrued interest on the notes through the date of purchase at a price of per share  ii purchase million shares of our series b preferred stock that were tendered in a tender offer at a price of per share  including all accrued and unpaid dividends on such shares  iii redeem million shares of our series a preferred stock at a price of per share  plus accrued dividends to the redemption date  and iv pay down a portion of our senior bank credit facility 
in connection with the debt issuance during the third quarter of  we also obtained an amendment to our senior bank credit facility that  among other changes  lowered the interest rate applicable to the outstanding balance on the facility 
these refinancing and recapitalization transactions effectively reduced the average interest rates on a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness  and substantially reduced the after tax dividend obligations associated with our outstanding preferred stock 
partially offsetting the favorable impacts of the refinancing and recapitalization transactions  the company recorded a non cash gain of million during associated with the extinguishment of a promissory note issued in connection with certain stockholder litigation that was settled during the first quarter of in addition  financial results for included a charge of million for expenses associated with the refinancing and recapitalization transactions completed in the second and third quarters of during the first and second quarters of  the company completed the redemption of the remaining shares of both series a and series b preferred stock at the stated rates of per share and per share  respectively  plus accrued dividends to the redemption date  and obtained an additional amendment to the senior bank credit facility further lowering the interest rate spread applicable to the term loan portion of the facility 

table of contents our financial results were also favorably impacted by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized  from million during to million during  associated with the construction and expansion projects during at six of our facilities 
we funded these construction and expansion projects with cash on hand and with cash generated from operating activities 
facility operations revenue and expenses per compensated man day for all of the facilities we owned or managed  exclusive of those discontinued see further discussion below regarding discontinued operations  were as follows for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy business from our federal customers  including the bop  the usms  and the ice  remains strong  while many of our state customers continue to experience budget difficulties 
our federal customers generated of our total revenue for both the years ended december  and while the budget difficulties experienced by our state customers presented challenges with respect to our per diem rates resulting in pressure on our management revenue in  these governmental entities were also constrained with respect to funds available for prison construction 
we believe the lack of new bed supply combined with state budget difficulties has contributed to the increase in our occupancy and has led several states  some of which have never utilized the private sector  to outsource their correctional needs to us 
additionally  as expected  we experienced a modest reduction in our operating margins during compared with as a result of recent contract awards for facilities we manage but do not own  which provide per diem rates and operating margins at lower levels than our owned and managed business 
we entered into these contracts knowing our overall per diem rates and operating margins would decrease slightly  however  the opportunity to both expand our level of service with existing customers and provide services to new customers with very little capital requirements outweighed the effects of the operating margin reductions 
our operating margins were also negatively impacted by the expenses incurred in connection with the resumption of operations and the process of ramping up occupancy at three of our facilities  the northeast ohio correctional center located in youngstown  ohio during the second and third quarters of  the tallahatchie county correctional facility located in tutwiler  mississippi during the first and second quarters of  and the managed only delta correctional facility located in greenwood  mississippi during the second quarter of operating expenses totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
salaries and benefits represent the most significant component of fixed operating expenses with approximately of our operating expenses consisting of salaries and 
table of contents benefits 
during  salaries and benefits expense at our correctional and detention facilities increased million from the increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to the commencement of operations during january at six correctional facilities located in texas pursuant to management contracts awarded by the texas department of criminal justice tdcj  as well as marginal increases in staffing levels at numerous facilities across the portfolio to meet rising inmate population needs 
however  due to the increase in occupancy  actual salaries and benefits per compensated man day declined per compensated man day during as compared to the prior year  as we were able to leverage our salaries and benefits over a larger inmate population 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in utilities expense of per compensated man day due to rising energy costs across the country 
while we were successful in containing or reducing most types of variable expenses  the reduction in variable operating expenses per compensated man day to per compensated man day during from per compensated man day during was primarily due to a reduction in expenses related to legal proceedings in which we were involved  and a decrease in inmate medical expenses 
under the terms of the new texas management contracts  the tdcj retained responsibility for all inmate medical requirements 
the following tables display the revenue and expenses per compensated man day for the facilities we own and manage and for the facilities we manage but do not own for the years ended december  owned and managed facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy managed only facilities revenue per compensated man day operating expenses per compensated man day fixed expense variable expense total operating margin per compensated man day operating margin average compensated occupancy the following discussions under owned and managed facilities and managed only facilities address significant events that impacted our results of operations for the respective periods  and events that will affect our results of operations in the future 

table of contents owned and managed facilities during january  we entered into an agreement with the state of vermont to manage up to inmates 
the contractual agreement represents the first time the state of vermont has partnered with the private corrections sector to provide residential services for its inmates 
the contractual terms provide for the out of state management of male  medium security vermont inmates primarily in two of our owned and managed prisons in kentucky  including lee adjustment center in beattyville  and marion adjustment center in st 
mary 
the influx of inmates from the state of vermont contributed million in additional revenue during as a result of a combination of rate increases and or an increase in population at four of our facilities  including our central arizona detention center  florence correctional center  san diego correctional facility  and dc correctional treatment facility  primarily from the usms  the ice  and the district of columbia  total management revenue increased during from the comparable period in  by million at these facilities 
during july  an inmate disturbance at the crowley county correctional facility located in olney springs  colorado resulted in damage to the facility  requiring us to transfer a substantial portion of the inmates to other of our facilities and to facilities owned by the state of colorado 
although repair of the facility was substantially complete at december   colorado continued to reduce inmate populations at all four of our facilities in colorado to as low as  in november however  the impact was mitigated by the recovery of million of business interruption and other insurance proceeds recognized during the first quarter of during the third quarter of  we transferred all of the wisconsin inmates housed at our  bed medium security north fork correctional facility located in sayre  oklahoma to our  bed medium security diamondback correctional facility located in watonga  oklahoma in order to satisfy a contractual provision mandated by the state of wisconsin 
as a result of the transfer  north fork correctional facility was idled 
accordingly  total management revenue decreased by million at this facility during compared with we are currently pursuing new management contracts and other opportunities to take advantage of the beds that became available at the north fork correctional facility and expect to reopen the facility in the first half of  but can provide no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
during  as expected  the state of wisconsin reduced the number of inmates housed at both our diamondback correctional facility and our prairie correctional facility by opening various facilities owned by the state 
as further described hereafter  the available beds at diamondback correctional facility  which resulted from the declining inmate population from the state of wisconsin  have been substantially filled with inmates from the state of arizona 
as of december   the state of wisconsin housed inmates at the prairie correctional facility  compared with approximately  wisconsin inmates held at various facilities at december  during may  we announced the completion of new agreements with the states of minnesota and north dakota to house portions of those states inmates at the  bed prairie correctional facility 
under the minnesota agreement  we are managing an unspecified number of medium security  male inmates at the prairie facility 
the population will fluctuate based on the state s needs and the space available at the prairie facility 
the terms of the contract include an initial one year period through june   with two one year renewal options 
the north dakota agreement  which became effective in march  had an initial term through february with an indefinite number of annual renewal options 
this contract  similar to the minnesota agreement  does not indicate a specific inmate population to be managed by us and varies based on the state s needs and space availability 
at december   we housed minnesota and north dakota inmates 
we also housed 
table of contents inmates from the state of washington at this facility pursuant to a contract awarded mid  as further described hereafter 
during march  we entered into an agreement with the state of arizona to initially manage  arizona inmates

we are managing federal prisoners from united states federal court districts that are experiencing a lack of detention space and or high detention costs 
as of december   we housed federal prisoners at this facility 
the operating revenues for were million while the operating expenses were million and million for and  respectively  at our northeast ohio correctional center 
we believed that re opening this facility put us in a competitive position to win contract awards for the utilization of the facility 
on december   we received a contract award from the bop to house approximately  federal inmates at our northeast ohio correctional center 
the contract  awarded as part of the criminal alien requirement phase solicitation car  provides for an initial four year term with three two year renewal options 
the terms of the contract provide for a guaranteed rate of occupancy for days following a notice to proceed  and a guaranteed rate of occupancy thereafter 
we began receiving bop inmates at this facility in the second quarter of during june  we announced our first inmate management contract with the state of alabama to house up to  medium security inmates in our tallahatchie county correctional facility  located in tutwiler  mississippi  under a temporary emergency agreement to provide the state of alabama immediate relief of its overcrowded prison system 
the facility began receiving inmates in july prior to receiving inmates from the state of alabama  this facility was substantially idle 
during january  we received notice from the alabama department of corrections that it would withdraw its inmates housed at the facility 
although the alabama department of corrections withdrew all of their inmates from this facility by mid march  staffing levels were not reduced significantly at the facility due to negotiations with several potential customers to utilize the beds that became available at this facility 
the facility incurred operating losses during and including depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively of million and million  respectively 
during may  we announced the completion of a contractual agreement to house inmates from the state of hawaii at the tallahatchie county correctional facility 
the new agreement expires on june  in addition  during july we extended our current contracts to house hawaiian inmates in our owned and operated diamondback correctional facility  and our florence correctional facility  located in florence  arizona for two additional years 
effective august   the combined contracts guarantee a minimum monthly average of  inmates to be housed at these three facilities 
as of december   we housed  hawaiian inmates at these three facilities  including inmates at the tallahatchie county correctional facility

the terms of the contract include an initial one year period  with two one year renewal options 
the facility began receiving hawaii inmates during september under a day contract completed in september we anticipate the existing customers at this facility to fill the remaining vacant space  but can provide no such assurance 
fixed expenses per compensated man day for our owned and managed facilities increased from during to during primarily as a result of an increase in fixed operating expense for salaries and benefits and utilities across the portfolio of facilities we manage 
variable expenses per compensated man day for our owned and managed facilities decreased from during to for due to the aforementioned decrease in litigation expenses across the portfolio of facilities we manage 
managed only facilities in november  we announced that the tdcj awarded us new contracts to manage six state correctional facilities  as part of a procurement re bid process 
the management contracts  all of which became effective january   consist of four jails and two correctional facilities 
based on the tdcj recommendation  we also retained our contract to manage the bartlett state jail  but were not awarded the contract to continue managing the  bed sanders estes unit located in venus  texas  which expired january  total management revenue increased million during compared with  due to the operation of these facilities  net of a reduction in revenue for the management contract not renewed 
total revenue per compensated man day and total variable expenses per compensated man day decreased for our managed only facilities primarily because we did not assume responsibility for medical services for inmates provided under terms of our new contracts with the tdcj 
eliminating this responsibility results in a lower per diem rate  however  it also reduces the risk that our profitability will be eroded in the future by increasing medical costs 
the new texas contracts 
table of contents accounted for approximately of the total revenue generated from the facilities we managed but did not own during on march   we announced the completion of a contractual agreement with mississippi s delta correctional authority to resume operations of the state owned  bed delta correctional facility located in greenwood  mississippi 
we managed the medium security correctional facility for the delta correctional authority from its opening in until the state closed the facility in  due to excess capacity in the state s corrections system 
the march contract was for one year  with one two year extension option 
we began receiving inmates from the state of mississippi at the facility on april  in addition  after completing the contractual agreement with the delta correctional authority  we entered into an additional contract to manage inmates from leflore county  mississippi 
this one year contract provides for housing for up to male inmates and up to female inmates  and is renewable annually 
as of december   we housed and inmates from the state of mississippi and leflore county  respectively 
effective august   we elected to terminate our contract to manage the bed tall trees juvenile facility owned by shelby county and located in memphis  tennessee 
the operating revenues for this facility for during were million  while the operating expenses were million 
general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and  general and administrative expenses totaled million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased from primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits  combined with an increase in professional services during compared with we have expanded our infrastructure over the past year to implement and support numerous technology initiatives  to maintain closer relationships with existing and potentially new customers in order to identify their needs  and to focus on reducing facility operating expenses 
while this has resulted in an annual increase in general and administrative expense  we believe our expanded infrastructure and investments in technology will provide long term benefits enabling us to provide enhanced quality service to our customers while creating scalable operating efficiencies 
during  we also incurred increasing expenses associated with a the implementation of certain tax strategies  which contributed to a reduction in income tax expense during  and b tax planning initiatives that we believe will lower our overall future effective tax rate 
see income tax expense hereafter for additional information 
we have also experienced increasing expenses over the prior year in complying with increasing corporate governance requirements  a significant portion of which was incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of interest expense  net gross interest expense  net of capitalized interest  was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest expense is based on outstanding borrowings under our senior bank credit facility  senior notes  senior notes  convertible subordinated notes payable balances  and amortization of loan costs and unused credit facility fees 
the decrease in gross interest expense from the prior year was primarily attributable to the aforementioned recapitalization and refinancing transactions completed during the second and third quarters of  which also resulted in a reduction to our preferred stock distributions from the prior year 

table of contents gross interest income was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and gross interest income is earned on cash collateral requirements  a direct financing lease  notes receivable  investments  and cash and cash equivalents 
capitalized interest was million and million during and  respectively  and was associated with various construction and expansion projects and the installation of a new inmate management system 
expenses associated with debt refinancing and recapitalization transactions for the years ended december  and  expenses associated with debt refinancing and recapitalization transactions were million and million  respectively 
the charges in were associated with the redemption of the remaining series a preferred stock in the first quarter of and the redemption of the remaining series b preferred stock in the second quarter of  as well as third party fees associated with the amendment to our senior bank credit facility obtained during the second quarter of charges during the third quarter of primarily resulted from the write off of existing deferred loan costs associated with the repayment of the term loan portion of our senior bank credit facility which repayment was made with proceeds from the issuance of the million senior notes  premiums paid to defease the remaining outstanding senior notes  and certain fees paid to amend the term portion of our senior bank credit facility 
charges during the second quarter of included expenses associated with the tender offer for our series b preferred stock  the redemption of our series a preferred stock  and the write off of existing deferred loan costs associated with the repayment of the term loan portions of our senior bank credit facility made with proceeds from the common stock and note offerings  a tender premium paid to the holders of the senior notes who tendered their notes to us at a price of of par  and fees associated with the modifications to the terms of the million of convertible subordinated notes 
change in fair value of derivative instruments on may   million shares of common stock were issued  along with a million subordinated promissory note  in connection with the final settlement of the state court portion of our stockholder litigation settlement reached during the first quarter of under the terms of the promissory note  the note and accrued interest were extinguished in june once the average closing price of our common stock exceeded a termination price equal to per share for fifteen consecutive trading days following the note s issuance 
the terms of the note  which allowed the principal balance to fluctuate dependent on the trading price of our common stock  created a derivative instrument that was valued and accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  as amended 
since we had previously reflected the maximum obligation of the contingency associated with the state portion of the stockholder litigation on the balance sheet  the extinguishment of the note in june resulted in a million non cash gain during the second quarter of income tax benefit expense during the years ended december  and  our financial statements reflected an income tax provision of million and an income tax benefit of million  respectively 
the income tax benefit during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance previously established for our deferred tax assets 

table of contents deferred income taxes reflect the available net operating losses and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of the future tax benefits related to deferred tax assets is dependent on many factors  including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of our deferred tax assets  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
as further discussed under critical accounting policies income taxes  prior to december   we had not consistently demonstrated an ability to utilize our tax net operating losses within the carryforward period and therefore applied a valuation allowance to reserve substantially all of our net deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas as a result  our financial statements did not reflect a provision for income taxes  other than for certain state taxes 
however  at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas  substantially all of the valuation allowance applied to such deferred tax assets was reversed on december  accordingly  in the first quarter of we began providing a provision for income taxes at a rate on income before taxes equal to the combined federal and state effective tax rates using current tax rates 
during  the internal revenue service completed its field audit of our federal income tax return 
during the fourth quarter of  the audit results underwent a review by the joint committee on taxation 
based on that review  the irs adjusted the carryback claims we filed on our and federal income tax returns  requiring us to repay approximately million of refunds we received during and as a result of tax law changes provided by the job creation and worker assistance act of a portion of our tax loss was deemed not to be available for carryback to and due to our restructuring that occurred between and however  we will carry this tax loss forward to offset future taxable income 
while the adjustment did not result in a loss of deductions claimed  we were obligated to repay the amount of the adjusted refund  plus interest of approximately million  or million after taxes  through december  these obligations were accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of december  the repayment of the refund adjusted by the irs resulted in an increase in the amount of deferred tax assets reflected on our balance sheet for the incremental net operating losses made available to offset taxable income in the future 
the increase in our net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the repayment effectively extends the date in which our net operating loss carryforwards are fully utilized 
we currently expect to fully utilize our remaining federal net operating losses during during the fourth quarter of  we realized a net income tax benefit of million resulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies that are also expected to reduce our future effective tax rate 
additionally  we recorded an income tax benefit of million in the third quarter of which primarily resulted from a change in estimated income taxes associated with certain financing transactions completed during  partially offset by changes in our valuation allowance applied to certain deferred tax assets 
discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  we were notified by the state of florida of its intention to not renew our contract to manage the bed okeechobee juvenile offender correctional center located in okeechobee  florida  upon the expiration of a short term extension to the existing management contract  which expired in december upon expiration of the short term extension  which occurred march   operation of the facility was transferred to the state of florida

during  we paid million in interest  including capitalized interest 
we had million of letters of credit outstanding at december  primarily to support our requirement to repay fees and claims under our workers compensation plan in the event we do not repay the fees and claims due in accordance with the terms of the plan 
the letters of credit are renewable annually 
we did not have any draws under any outstanding letters of credit during   or recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
when adopted  pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
in accordance with the sec s april ruling  sfas r must be adopted for annual periods that begin after june  early adoption will be permitted in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based 
table of contents payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
as previously permitted by sfas  we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options  except as a result of the previously announced december accelerated vesting of stock options which resulted in a compensation charge during the fourth quarter of of million in accordance with apb accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method could have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  because we made changes in to our historical business practices with respect to awarding stock based employee compensation  the impact of the standard is expected to be less than the historical pro forma impact as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the footnote  accounting for stock based compensation  in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
further  the pro forma data for also includes million of compensation expense associated with the accelerated vesting of all stock options outstanding effective december  sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had or will have a direct adverse effect on our operations 
many of our management contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  which mitigates an adverse impact of inflation on net income 
however  a substantial increase in personnel costs  workers compensation or food and medical expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the future to the extent that these expenses increase at a faster pace than the per diem or fixed rates we receive for our management services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is to changes in us interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk related to our senior bank credit facility  which had an outstanding balance of million as of december  as further described in note to our consolidated financial statements  during the first quarter of we repaid our old senior bank credit facility primarily with the proceeds from the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due  and replaced the old senior bank credit facility with a new revolving credit facility with a capacity of million 
the interest on our senior bank credit facility was  and our new revolving credit facility is  subject to fluctuations in the market 
if the interest rate for our outstanding indebtedness under the senior bank credit facility was basis points higher or lower during the years ended december    and  our interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  would 
table of contents have been increased or decreased by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had outstanding million of senior notes with a fixed rate of and million of senior notes with a fixed rate of 
because the interest rates with respect to these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in order to satisfy a requirement of the senior bank credit facility we purchased an interest rate cap agreement  capping libor at prior to the applicable spread on outstanding balances of million through the expiration of the cap agreement on may   for a price of million 
we do not currently intend to enter into any additional interest rate protection agreements in the short term 
we may  from time to time  invest our cash in a variety of short term financial instruments 
these instruments generally consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase  a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not materially affect the value of these instruments
