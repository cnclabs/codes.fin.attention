item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview our business model is based primarily upon the design  production and sale of wireless connectivity software for use with wireless communication networks worldwide 
our products are utilized in major wireless networks throughout the world that support data communications through the use of cell phones or other wireless communication devices such as pc cards 
wireless network providers generally incorporate our products into their accessory products sold directly to individual consumers to offer wireless pc data connectivity to their wireless networks 
our business is primarily dependent upon the demand for wireless communications and the corresponding requirements for wireless connectivity software to support this demand 
during the last three years  demand for these types of products has fluctuated dramatically  and there has been a significant increase in price competition within our industry 
we continue to invest in research and development of wireless software products  and we believe that we have one the industry s leading wireless product lines in terms of performance and features 
we believe that our out of the box design technology further differentiates our products 
we also sell ebusiness and utility software and professional consulting services related to ebusiness applications 
during  we have maintained a sharp focus on our operating cost structure while ensuring that we maintain our operating flexibility to support future growth in the industry 
we measure success by monitoring our net sales and gross margins and operating cash flow 
we believe that there continues to be excellent growth opportunities within the wireless communications software marketplace and we continue to focus on positioning smith micro to benefit from these opportunities 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operating data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  net revenues products services total net revenues cost of revenues products services total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss interest income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss revenues total net revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively  with an increase of million  or from to and an increase of million  or from to the increase in our revenues from through is attributed to the growth in sales of our wireless products and in also includes the acquisition of allume 
sales to individual customers and their affiliates  which amounted to more than of the company s net revenues  included one oem customer at in  one oem customer at of revenues in and three oem customers at  and of revenues in we currently operate in two business segments products and services 
in addition  product revenues are broken down into three business units  wireless and oem  retail and distribution and internet direct sales 
our retail and distribution sales represent the sales of allume products to distributors  retail customers and individuals 
allume was acquired on july  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
internet direct sales unit includes legacy smith micro utility and fax software products as well as consulting  fulfillment and hosting revenue 
the following table shows the net revenues and cost of revenues generated by each segment year ended december  products services products services products services wireless oem retail distribution internet direct total revenues cost of revenues gross profit products 
net revenues from sales of products were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or from to and an increase of million  or from to product revenues accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in there are two key drivers to the increase in our product revenues from to our core wireless business increased from million to million 
the increase can be attributed to the continued success of the wireless broadband data rollouts by our carrier customers 
the second key contributor was the addition of the retail and distribution business unit this year allume acquisition on july   which posted revenues of million for internet and direct sales continue to decrease reflecting a continued change in focus for the business 
the change in our product revenue from to is primarily due to the increase in our core wireless business  for which sales to verizon were million consisting of sales of quicklink mobile and quicklink mobile phonebook 
internet direct sales decreased  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total revenues  reflecting a repositioning of our business from the retail fax and utility software business to the wireless communications business 
we traditionally have relatively little backlog for our oem products at any given time and we have not considered backlog to be a significant indicator of future performance 
however  as our wireless business has evolved  production cycle time for items such as data kits has increased to the point that orders received towards the end of a quarter may not ship until the subsequent quarter 
additionally  customers may issue purchase orders that have extended delivery dates 
therefore  in  we began tracking our quarterly backlog situation although the level of backlog is not necessarily indicative of trends in our business 
as of december  however  we had a backlog of million  comparing to million at december  when we first began reporting backlog  resulting from orders placed late in the fourth quarter and not shipped 
since we generally do not produce software in advance of anticipated orders our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked in that quarter 
services 
consulting services revenues were   and  in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or from to and a decrease of  or from to services revenue accounted for of total revenues in  of total revenues in and of total revenues in the decrease in service revenue is due to the reduced focus on consulting services  which was announced in the first quarter of  due to the decrease in demand for such services 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  from to and an increase of million  or  from to gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was for as compared to for and for cost of revenues for the current year includes  of amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of allume which is not included in or expenses 
factoring out amortization of intangibles  gross margin for was 
the pro forma increase from the year earlier period is attributed to increased sales of higher margin pc card software product versus lower margin mobile office kit products 
direct costs of revenues consist primarily of cd replication costs 
we use a variety of providers located in china  korea and the united states 
we consider cd replication to be a commodity with little or no risk to supplier fluctuations 
we also purchase proprietary cables from motorola and generic oem cables from a variety of suppliers 
cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues was   and  in  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or from to and an increase of  or from to cost of service revenue as a percentage of service revenues was for  for and in cost of service revenues includes the cost of our consulting personnel and the cost of any outside consultants contracted to support our staff and vary by contract 
operating expenses the following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses by functional category and as a percentage of total net revenues years ended december  operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  from to and a decrease of  or  from to our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising costs  sales commissions and trade show expenses 
these expenses vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the timing of trade shows and product introductions 
while most of the increases in selling and marketing expenses in were due to the allume acquisition  we also had a slight increase in headcount and increases in costs related to product collateral concept and design 
the decrease in costs from to is directly attributable to the elimination of channel marketing expenses of approximately  and the elimination of depreciation and other miscellaneous expenses of  relating to the san diego sales office which was closed in these decreases were offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of approximately  which relates to the reallocation of resources from other departments to sales and marketing 
advertising expenses were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
selling and marketing expenses were  and of revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
increases in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues in were caused by the increase in costs as described above 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to and  or  from to our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and equipment costs required to conduct our software development efforts 
we remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology  particularly our wireless  multi media  and compression software technologies 
the increase in our research and development expenses in each year was primarily due to the development of new wireless products that were released during the periods  with an accompanying increase in headcount and a refocus of engineering resources from consulting projects to development 
in  the key driver to increased r d expense was the acquisition of allume systems on july  and the associated engineering staff which is focused on new compression technology 
research and development expenses were  and of revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues from to is due to the significant increase in revenues during the period 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing increases of million  or  from to and  or  from to the increase in general and administrative costs from to was primarily due to the acquisition of allume systems on july  and the assumption of allume g a staff and certain integration costs 
the increase in general and administrative costs from to consists of increases in accounting  legal and consulting fees of approximately  travel expenses of approximately  and compensation and benefit costs of approximately  general and administrative expenses were  and of revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from to is due to the increase in revenues  partially offset by the absolute dollar increase in expenses 
beginning in fiscal  we will be adopting fas r  which requires the expensing of stock options 
taking into account options issued and outstanding at december   we estimate that our stock compensation expense would be approximately million 
new option issuances or restricted stock grants made in fiscal would increase the estimate 
interest income 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of  or  from to and  or from to the differences in our interest income are directly related to the fluctuations in our cash balances during the periods and changing interest rates 
we have not changed our investment strategy during the periods being reported  with our excess cash consistently being invested in short term marketable securities 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion elsewhere in this report 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was   and  in  and  respectively 
the provision in and relates to alternative minimum tax liability 
the provision in consists of minimum payments for state taxes 
we have provided a valuation allowance on of our deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance against such asset 
factors that are considered in the evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset are continued profitability and our ability to meet our future forecasts 
in general  any realization of our net deferred tax asset will reduce the effective rate in future periods 
however  the realization of deferred tax assets that are related to net operating losses that were generated by tax deductions resulting from the exercise of non qualified stock options  will result in a direct increase to stockholders equity 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from net proceeds of million generated by our initial public offering in on february   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement for the private placement of  shares of our common stock  par value  at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate gross cash proceeds to the company of  before deducting commissions and other expenses 
offering costs related to the transaction totaled  comprised of  in commissions and  cash payments for legal and investment services  resulting in net proceeds to the company of  the transaction closed simultaneously with the execution of the purchase agreement on february  ce unterberg  towbin llc  the placement agent for the transaction  received a cash fee equal to of the aggregate gross proceeds of the private placement 
net cash provided by operations was million in and million in the primary source of operating cash in both periods was the net income and the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset by the collection of accounts receivable 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in and  in this included million for the purchase of allume in july  as well as  for other capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures in both periods consisted of the purchase of computers and other office equipment 
we received  in cash from the exercise of employee stock options in compared to million in at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
we have no significant capital commitments  and currently anticipate that capital expenditures will not vary significantly from recent periods 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us at commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our corporate headquarters  which includes our principal administrative  sales and marketing  customer support and research and development facilities  is located in aliso viejo  california 
we have leased this space through may we also lease approximately  square feet in watsonville  california under a new lease that expires september  we are currently working on a new operating lease for our facility in lee s summit  missouri to replace the lease that expired in june as of december   we had no debt and no long term liabilities 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total during our normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include intellectual property indemnities to our customers and licensees in connection with the use  sale and or license of our products  indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease  indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on the negligence or willful misconduct  indemnities involving the accuracy of representations and warranties in certain contracts  and indemnities to directors and officers of the company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
in addition  we have made contractual commitments to employees providing for severance payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events 
we may also issue a guarantee in the form of a standby letter of credit as security for contingent liabilities under certain customer contracts 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees may not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as it becomes available 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software revenue is recognized in accordance with the statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software to oem customers or end users as completed products are shipped and title passes  or from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  if the other requirements of sop are met 
if the requirements of sop are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognized until these elements are known or resolved 
returns from oem customers are limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
historically  oem customer returns have not exceeded the very nominal estimates and reserves 
management reviews available retail channel information and makes a determination of a return provision for sales made to distributors and retailers based on current channel inventory levels and historical return patterns 
certain sales to distributors or retailers are made on a consignment basis 
revenue for consignment sales are not recognized until sell through to the final customer is established 
product sales directly to end users are recognized upon delivery 
end users have a thirty day right of return  but such returns are reasonably estimable and have historically been immaterial 
we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 
service revenues include sales of consulting services  website hosting and fulfillment 
we recognize service revenues as services are provided or as milestones are delivered and accepted by our customers 
accounts receivable we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we estimate credit losses and maintain a bad debt reserve based upon these estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within our estimated reserves  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill we have adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  and no impairment was identified 
as a result of the adoption  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas  goodwill was amortized over years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
our annual impairment testing date is december recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the fair value of its net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities 
we determined that we did not have any impairment of goodwill at december  estimates of reporting unit fair value are based upon market capitalization and therefore are volatile being sensitive to market fluctuations 
to the extent that our market capitalization decreases significantly or the allocation of value to our reporting units change  we could be required to write off some or all of our goodwill 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we currently have a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
based on our assessment of all available evidence  we concluded that it is not more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
this conclusion is based primarily on our history of net operating losses as compared to only a recent trend of profitable operations  the potential for future stock option deductions to significantly reduce taxable income  annual net operating loss limitations under section of the code and the need to generate significant amounts of taxable income in future periods on a consistent and prolonged basis in order to utilize the deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor all available evidence and reassess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets 
if we continue to meet our financial projections and improve our results of operations  or if circumstances otherwise change  it is possible that we may release all or a portion of our valuation allowance in the future 
any such release would result in recording a tax benefit that would increase net income in the period the valuation is released 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas no 
 which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like offset accounting 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
the statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations  requires that a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  permits an entity to choose either the amortization method or the fair value method for subsequent measurement for each class of separately recognized servicing assets or servicing liabilities  permits at initial adoption a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by an entity with recognized servicing rights  provided the securities reclassified offset the entity s exposure to changes in the fair value of the servicing assets or liabilities  and requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the balance sheet and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after september   with earlier adoption permitted in certain circumstances 
the statement also describes the manner in which it should be initially applied 
we do not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to narrow the scope exception for interest only and principal only strips on debt instruments to include only such strips representing rights to receive a specified portion of the contractual interest or principle cash flows 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
to allow qualifying special purpose entities to hold a passive derivative financial instrument pertaining to beneficial interests that itself is a derivative instrument 
we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard but believe that it will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 an amendment to accounting principles bulletin opinion no 
 accounting changes apb no 
 and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
though sfas no 
carries forward the guidance in apb no 
and sfas no 
with respect to accounting for changes in estimates  changes in reporting entity  and the correction of errors  sfas no 
establishes new standards on accounting for changes in accounting principles  whereby all such changes must be accounted for by retrospective application to the financial statements of prior periods unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted for changes and corrections made in years beginning after may we will implement sfas no 
in its fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard but believe that it will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
in addition  sfas no 
r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in our first quarter of  beginning january  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include prospective and retroactive adoption methods 
under the retroactive methods  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and share awards beginning with the first period restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
r and we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
we have not determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting sfas no

risk factors our future operating results are highly uncertain 
before deciding to invest in our common stock or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our reports on forms k  q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  that could seriously harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price may decline 
fluctuations in our operating results may be due to a number of factors  including the following the size and timing of orders from and shipments to our major customers  the size and timing of any return product requests for our products  our ability to maintain or increase gross margins  variations in our sales channels or the mix of our product sales  the gain or loss of a key customer  our ability to specify  develop  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a timely manner  the availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effect on sales and pricing of our products  the effect of new and emerging technologies  deferrals of orders by our customers in anticipation of new products  applications  product enhancements or operating systems  and general economic and market conditions 
a large portion of our operating expenses  including rent  depreciation and amortization is fixed and difficult to reduce or change 
accordingly  if our total revenue does not meet our expectations  we may not be able to adjust our expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall in revenue 
in that event  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
due to all of the foregoing factors  and the other risks discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance 
although we have begun reporting backlog  our ability to predict our revenues and operating results is extremely limited 
we have historically operated with little backlog because we have generally shipped our software products and recognized revenue shortly after we received orders because our production cycle has traditionally been very short 
as a result  our sales in any quarter were generally dependent on orders that were booked and shipped in that quarter 
as our wireless business has evolved  production cycle time for items such as data kits has increased to the point that orders received towards the end of a quarter may not ship until the subsequent quarter 
additionally  customers may issue purchase orders that have extended delivery dates that may cause the shipment to fall in a subsequent quarter 
these situations make it difficult for us to predict what our revenues and operating results will be in any quarter 
therefore  the level of backlog is not necessarily indicative of trends in our business 
as of december   we had a backlog of approximately million 
we depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
in the past we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to a small number of customers and expect to continue to do so in the future 
the agreements we have with these entities do not require them to purchase any minimum quantity of our products and may be terminated by the entity or us at any time for any reason upon minimal prior written notice 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that these customers will continue to place large orders for our products in the future  or purchase our products at all 
our largest oem customer accounted for  and of our net revenues in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
our three largest oem customers accounted for  and in the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
our customers may acquire products from our competitors or develop their own products that compete directly with ours 
any substantial decrease or delay in our sales to one or more of these entities in any quarter would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  certain of our customers have in the past and may in the future acquire competitors or be acquired by competitors  causing further industry consolidation 
in the past  such acquisitions have caused the purchasing departments of the combined companies to reevaluate their purchasing decisions 
if one of our major customers engages in an acquisition in the future  it could change its current purchasing habits 
in that event  we could lose the customer  or experience a decrease in orders from that customer or a delay in orders previously made by that customer 
further  although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  the insolvency of one or more of our major customers could result in a substantial decrease in our revenues 
competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors  which could negatively affect our revenues 
we operate in markets that are extremely competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology 
specifically  microsoft corporation poses a significant competitive threat to us because microsoft operating systems may include some capabilities now provided by certain of our oem and retail software products 
if users are satisfied relying on the capabilities of the windows based systems or other operating systems  or other vendors products  sales of our products are likely to decline 
in addition  because there are low barriers to entry into the software market  we expect significant competition from both established and emerging software companies in the future 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential oem customers may acquire or develop products that compete directly with our products 
microsoft and many of our other current and prospective competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  service  support  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
there is also a substantial risk that announcements of competing products by large competitors such as microsoft or other vendors could result in the cancellation of orders by customers in anticipation of the introduction of such new products 
in addition  some of our competitors currently make complementary products that are sold separately 
such competitors could decide to enhance their competitive position by bundling their products to attract customers seeking integrated  cost effective software applications 
some competitors have a retail emphasis and offer oem products with a reduced set of features 
the opportunity for retail upgrade sales may induce these and other competitors to make oem products available at their own cost or even at a loss 
we also expect competition to increase as a result of software industry consolidations  which may lead to the creation of additional large and well financed competitors 
increased competition is likely to result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced margins and loss of market share 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may disrupt our business and divert management attention and cause our current operations to suffer 
we recently acquired all the outstanding capital stock of allume  inc see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
we expect to continue to consider acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies 
as part of any such acquisition  including that of allume  inc  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from our company s day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
acquisitions may also subject us to liabilities and risks that are not known or identifiable at the time of the acquisition 
we may also have to incur debt or issue equity securities in order to finance future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our existing stockholders 
in addition  we expect our profitability could be adversely affected because of acquisition related accounting costs and write offs 
in consummating acquisitions  we are also subject to risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have had limited or no prior experience 
if we are unable to fully integrate acquired businesses  products or technologies within existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of acquisitions 
if the adoption of new technologies and services grows more slowly than anticipated in our product planning and development  our future sales and profits may be negatively affected 
if the adoption of new technologies and services does not grow or grows more slowly than anticipated in our product planning and development  demand for certain of our products and services will be reduced 
for example  our new quicklink mobile and quicklink enterprise products provide notebook users with the ability to roam between wireless wide area networks wwan and wi fi hot spots 
therefore  future sales and any future profits from these and related products are substantially dependent upon the widespread acceptance and use of wi fi as an effective medium of communication by consumers and businesses 
our products may contain undetected software errors  which could negatively affect our revenues 
our software products are complex and may contain undetected errors 
in the past  we have discovered software errors in certain of our products and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period it took to correct these errors 
although we and our oem customers test our products  it is possible that errors may be found in our new or existing products after we have commenced commercial shipment of those products 
these undetected errors could result in adverse publicity  loss of revenues  delay in market acceptance of our products or claims against us by customers 
technology and customer needs change rapidly in our market  which could render our products obsolete and negatively affect our revenue 
our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and industry standards 
we will also need to continue to develop and introduce new and enhanced products to meet our customers changing demands  keep up with evolving industry standards  including changes in the microsoft operating systems with which our products are designed to be compatible  and to promote those products successfully 
the communications and utilities software markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and short product life cycles 
any of these factors could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
in addition  new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods as a result of the complexities inherent in today s computing environments and the performance demanded by customers 
if our software markets do not develop as we anticipate  or our products do not gain widespread acceptance in these markets or if we are unable to develop new versions of our software products that can operate on future operating systems  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
delays or failure in deliveries from our component suppliers could cause our net revenue to decline and harm our results of operations 
we rely on third party suppliers to provide us with services and components for our product kits 
these components include compact discs  cables  printed manuals  and boxes 
we do not have long term supply arrangements with any vendor to obtain these necessary services and components for our products 
if we are unable to purchase components from these suppliers or if the compact disc replication services that we use do not deliver our requirements on schedule  we may not be able to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis or enter into new orders because of a shortage in components 
any delays that we experience in delivering our products to customers could impair our customer relationships and adversely impact our reputation and our business 
in addition  if our third party suppliers raise their prices for components or services  our gross margins would be reduced 
a shortage in the supply of wireless communication devices such as pc cards could adversely affect our revenues 
our products are utilized with major wireless networks throughout the world that support data communications through the use of wireless communication devices such as pc cards 
since wireless network providers generally incorporate our products into the wireless communication devices that they sell directly to individual consumers  our future success depends upon the availability of such devices to consumers at reasonable prices 
a shortage in the supply of wireless communication devices could put upward pressure on prices or limit the quantities available to individual consumers which could materially affect the revenues that we generate from our products 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights  which could negatively impact our revenues 
our success is dependent upon our software code base  our programming methodologies and other intellectual properties and proprietary rights 
in order to protect our proprietary technology  we rely on a combination of trade secret  nondisclosure and copyright and trademark law 
we currently own united states trademark registrations for certain of our trademarks and united states patents for certain of our technologies  however  these measures afford us only limited protection 
furthermore  we rely primarily on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
accordingly  it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain our rights without our authorization 
it is also possible that third parties may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
it may be difficult for us to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement as the number of trademarks  patents  copyrights and other intellectual property rights asserted by companies in our industry grows and the coverage of these patents and other rights and the functionality of software products increasingly overlap 
from time to time  we have received communications from third parties asserting that our trade name or features  content  or trademarks of certain of our products infringe upon intellectual property rights held by such third parties 
we have also received correspondence from third parties separately asserting that our fax products may infringe on certain patents held by each of the parties 
although we are not aware that any of our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim infringement by us with respect to our current or future products 
infringement claims  whether with or without merit  could result in time consuming and costly litigation  divert the attention of our management  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties 
if we are required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  they may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
unfavorable royalty or licensing agreements could seriously impair our ability to market our products 
our stock price is highly volatile 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
these fluctuations have occurred and may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors  customers or us  market conditions within our retail and oem software markets  general global economic and political instability  changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by analysts  changes in investor perceptions  or changes in expectations relating to our products  plans and strategic position or those of our competitors or customers 
in addition  the market prices of securities of high technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies 
accordingly  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were the object of a securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial losses and divert management s attention and resources from other matters 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  the loss of their services could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management and other key technical and consulting personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with our key employees that govern the length of their service 
the loss of the services of our key employees would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  particularly highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing research and development required to develop and enhance our communication software products as well those in our highly specialized consulting business 
competition for these employees remains high and employee retention is a common problem in our industry 
our inability to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are essential to our product development  consulting services  marketing  service and support teams may limit the rate at which we can generate revenue  develop new products or product enhancements and generally would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  retaining key employees during restructuring efforts is critical to our company s success 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future through the issuance of additional equity  or convertible debt securities or by borrowing money  in order to meet our capital needs 
additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us to allow us to meet our capital needs 
we believe that the cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or choose to obtain additional financing to fund our activities 
we could raise these funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our operations or other business activities significantly or to obtain funds through arrangements with strategic partners or others that may require us to relinquish right to certain technologies or potential markets 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
we currently have no established line of credit or other business borrowing facility in place 
it is possible that our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors response to our products  and our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected as a result of legal  business and economic risks specific to international operations 
each year  a percentage of our revenues are derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
this percentage can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also frequently ship products to our domestic customers international manufacturing divisions and subcontractors 
in the future  we may expand these international business activities 
international operations are subject to many inherent risks  including general political  social and economic instability  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls  exposure to different legal standards  particularly with respect to intellectual property  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  foreign technical standards  changes in tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in securing and servicing international customers  difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
these conditions may increase our cost of doing business 
moreover  as our customers are adversely affected by these conditions  our business with them may be disrupted and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the sale of significant numbers of shares of our common stock by any of our principal stockholders 
a total of  shares of our common stock were sold in a private placement in february the associated registration statement for such shares became effective on june  in addition  there are other large blocks of shares held by individual stockholders which are eligible for resale under rule  including william w 
smith  jr  our president and chief executive officer  who held  shares at march   and rhonda l 
smith who held  shares 
overall  our trading volume fluctuates widely and at times is relatively limited 
the market price for our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a large number of the shares or the perception that such sales may occur 
the sale of a large number of our common stock also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at the prices that we deem appropriate 
we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and may sustain a loss of public confidence if we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting and have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to such evaluation on an annual basis 
compliance with these requirements can be expensive and time consuming 
while we believe that we will be able to meet the required deadlines  no assurance can be given that we will meet the required deadlines in future years 
if we fail to timely complete this evaluation  or if our auditors cannot timely attest to our evaluation  we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our internal controls 
provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law could make a takeover of our company difficult 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for instance  our certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to fix the rights and preferences of shares of any series of preferred stock  without action by our stockholders 
as a result  the board can authorize and issue shares of preferred stock  which could delay or prevent a change of control because the rights given to the holders of such preferred stock may prohibit a merger  reorganization  sale or other extraordinary corporate transaction 
in addition  we are organized under the laws of the state of delaware and certain provisions of delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
we may be subject to additional risks 
the risks and uncertainties described above are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
because of their short duration  changes in market interest rates would not have a material effect on fair value 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure as we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not have significant currency exposure at december
