risk factors above 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release numbers  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
based on its terms of fob shipping point  where risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer at the time of shipment  the company recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped or  for company stores  at the point of sale 
the company records sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
under these guidelines  revenue is recognized when all of the following exist persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
the company also includes payments from its customers for shipping and handling in its net revenues line item in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting of shipping and handling fees and costs 
provisions are made for estimated sales returns and other allowances 
sales returns  markdowns and other allowances 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenues 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  and sell through of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
the reserves for sales returns  markdowns and other allowances amounted to million at october  compared to million at october  the increase is attributed to significantly higher markdown allowances both granted and provided for to compensate our retail vendors for products that had less than expected sell through because of poor customer appeal and a highly promotional department store environment 
during the year ended october   the company significantly increased the estimate for markdown allowances for its retail sales based on recent experience in the retail channel 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management must also make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting 
table of contents from the inability of its customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
management determines the adequacy of this allowance by analyzing current economic conditions  historical bad debts and continually evaluating individual customer receivables while considering the customer s financial condition 
the company has credit insurance to cover many of its major accounts 
our trade accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million  at october  as compared to the balance of million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million at october  allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of trade accounts receivable was at october  compared to at october  the increase in allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of trade accounts receivable during the year ended october  was primarily the result of an increase in the dollar amount of past due accounts as a percentage of the total accounts 
inventory 
the company writes down its inventory by amounts equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about the age of the inventory  future demand  and market conditions 
this process provides for a new basis for the inventory until it is sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory balance was million  net of inventory write downs of million at october   as compared to an inventory balance of million  net of inventory write downs of million at october  the increase in the inventory write downs is primarily attributed to price compression on clearance sales 
the company s management believes that the price compression on clearance sales resulted from an excess of golf inspired apparel in traditional clearance and liquidation channels as well as management s strategic decision to discontinue selling to certain clearance retailers and sell only to a select group of clearance retailers that management believes do not damage the brand images or reputations 
asset purchase credits 
in november  the company entered into an agreement with a third party whereby prior seasons slower selling inventory which was not damaged was exchanged for future asset purchase credits apcs  which may be utilized by the company to purchase future goods and services over a four year period 
the original value of the inventory exchanged at cost was million resulting in million in future apcs 
in december  the company amended its agreement with the third party to exchange million of additional prior seasons slower selling inventory at cost for an additional million in future apcs and an extension of the original november agreement through december the company has entered into contracts with several third party suppliers who have agreed to accept these apcs  in part  as payment for goods and services 
the company purchases products such as sales fixtures  office and packaging supplies  as well as temporary help  freight and printing services from such third party suppliers 
from time to time  the company may enter into additional contracts with such third party suppliers to use the apcs 
management reviews and estimates the likelihood of fully utilizing the apcs on a periodic basis 
if the company is unable to find suppliers who agree to accept the apcs in quantities as projected by management  a write down of the value of the apcs may be required 
at october   the company had million of the apcs remaining and management expects to fully utilize them over the remaining life of the contract through december off balance sheet arrangements at october  and  the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  the company does not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts that rely on estimation techniques to calculate fair value 
as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships

preparing for additional growth 
the company s new edc opened on november  its operations in the first three quarters of fiscal were not as efficient as originally planned primarily due to issues caused by the programming requirements necessary to have the many varied systems work together

it also owns the adjoining seven acres which should accommodate any future expansion requirements
