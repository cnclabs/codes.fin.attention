item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
words such as believes  expects  anticipates and the like indicate forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include comments related to our projected revenue  gross margin  operating expense  profitability  income tax expense  effective tax rate  capital spending and cash balances  the adequacy of our cash balances to fund our operations  projected volatility in our financial results  projected customer requirements for new capacity and technology upgrades for our installed base of magnetic disk manufacturing equipment and when  and if  our customers will place orders for these products  projected change from period to period in the customers  and location of customers  that constitute the majority of our revenues  the length of development  marketing and deployment cycles for military customers  imaging s ability to proliferate its technology into major military weapons programs and to develop and introduce commercial products  and the timing of delivery and or acceptance of our backlog for revenue 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements for a variety of reasons  including those set forth under risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our operations include two businesses  equipment and imaging 
the equipment business designs  manufactures  markets and services complex capital equipment that deposits highly engineered thin films of material onto disks used in hard disk drives 
our imaging business develops and manufactures electro optical sensors  cameras and systems that permit highly sensitive detection of photons in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum  allowing vision in extreme low light situations 
the vast majority of our revenue is currently derived from our equipment business and we expect that the majority of our revenues for the next several years will continue to be derived from our equipment business 
equipment business in the early s we developed a system  the mdp  to deposit magnetic films and protective overcoats onto magnetic disks used in hard disk drives 
this system gained wide acceptance and by the late s was being used to manufacture approximately half of the disks used in hard disk drives worldwide 
in late  we introduced a new system  the lean 
we believe that there are a total of approximately mdp and lean systems currently in use in production and research and development applications 
the hard disk drive industry has gone through significant consolidation  and there are now only eight significant manufacturers of magnetic disks  some of whom also manufacture hard disk drives 
as a result of an increasingly smaller number of customers and the high average selling price of our products  our equipment revenues tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our equipment business has historically been subject to capital spending cycles 
for example  in the period from through the middle of  we sold million of disk manufacturing equipment 
in the period from the middle of thru  our disk equipment revenues averaged approximately million per year and consisted of the sale of a limited number of systems  technology upgrades  parts and service for the installed base of our systems 
in our sales of disk manufacturing equipment grew to million in annual revenues 
we believe the majority of magnetic disk manufacturers are now utilizing most of their capacity 
we believe that the introduction of high density disks based on perpendicular recording techniques will also require disk manufacturers to significantly upgrade the technical capability of their installed base of manufacturing equipment to accommodate the additional number of process steps predicted to be required by perpendicular recording technology roadmaps 
in the past we manufactured both deposition and rapid thermal processing equipment used in the manufacture of flat panel displays 
in late we sold our rapid thermal processing product line and stopped actively marketing our deposition product line 
from through  cumulative revenues from sales of flat panel display manufacturing systems totaled million 
revenues included million related to selling a license to one of our flat panel patents and recognizing revenue on the last flat panel system we shipped 

table of contents imaging business our imaging business develops and manufactures electro optical sensors  cameras and systems that permit highly sensitive detection of photons in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum  allowing imaging in extreme low light situations 
our military products include extreme low light sensors and cameras for use in short to medium range military applications and livar cameras and systems for positive target identification at long range 
the majority of the funding for our imaging business activities has historically been derived from research and development contracts with the united states government and its contractors  with the balance being funded internally 
developing advanced products for the military involves long development cycles  as products move through successive multi year stages of technology demonstration  engineering and manufacturing product development  prototype production and then product deployment 
each stage in this process requires ongoing government funding 
to date  substantially all of our imaging business revenues has been derived from contract research and development  rather than product sales 
in july  in order to shorten the time to market and to increase the number of markets for our imaging products  we began to fund development of imaging products for commercial markets 
revenues from these activities have not yet been significant and we do not anticipate that they will be significant in critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial conditions and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
many of these uncertainties are discussed in the prior section entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with us gaap  and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates we make in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates related to the collectibility of trade receivables  valuation of deferred tax assets and prototype product costs 
we believe that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operation for a given period 
revenue recognition certain of our system sales with customer acceptance provisions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have previously met defined customer acceptance levels with the specific type of system  then 
table of contents we recognize revenue for the fair market value of the system upon shipment and transfer of title  and recognize revenue for the fair market value of installation and acceptance services when those services are completed 
we estimate the fair market value of the installation and acceptance services based on our actual historical experience 
for systems that have generally not been demonstrated to meet a particular customer s product specifications prior to shipment  revenue recognition is typically deferred until customer acceptance 
for example  while initial shipments of our lean system were recognized for revenue upon customer acceptance during  revenue was recognized upon shipment for the majority of leans shipped in most of the systems in backlog at december  are for customers where we have met defined customer acceptance levels and we expect to recognize revenue upon shipment for those systems 
in some instances  hardware that is not essential to the functioning of the system may be delivered after acceptance of the system 
in these cases  we estimate the fair market value of the non essential hardware as if it had been sold on a stand alone basis  and defer recognizing revenue on that value until the hardware is delivered 
in certain cases  we sell limited rights to our intellectual property 
revenue from the sale of any intellectual property license will generally be recognized at the inception of the license term 
we perform best efforts research and development work under various government sponsored research contracts 
these contracts are a mixture of cost plus fixed fee cpff and firm fixed price ffp 
revenue on cpff contracts is recognized in accordance with contract terms  typically as costs are incurred 
revenue on ffp contracts is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
provisions for estimated losses on government sponsored research contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined 
inventories inventories are priced using standard costs  which approximate first in  first out  and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated excess and obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
a cost to market reserve is established for work in progress and finished goods inventories when the value of the inventory plus the estimated cost to complete exceeds the net realizable value of the inventory 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
our warranty is per contract terms and for our systems the warranty typically ranges between and months from customer acceptance 
we use estimated repair or replacement costs along with our actual warranty experience to determine our warranty obligation 
we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

table of contents net revenues consist primarily of sales of equipment used to manufacture thin film disks  equipment used to manufacture flat panel displays  related equipment and system components  flat panel equipment technology license fees  contract research and development related to the development of electro optical sensors  cameras and systems  and low light imaging products 
the increase in equipment revenues in was the result of the sale of twenty three lean systems  six mdp systems  fourteen disk lubrication systems and an increase in revenue from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts 
revenues also included million of flat panel equipment and license sales 
during  we sold eleven lean systems and two mdp systems 
during  we sold two mdp systems and recognized revenue on upgrades to five d star systems that were originally delivered in the magnetic disk manufacturing industry has now consolidated into a small number of large manufacturers 
early in seagate announced its proposed acquisition of maxtor  which will further concentrate our customer base 
we believe that the majority of our active customers utilize most of their capacity and that there is significant potential for these customers to both continue adding capacity and to upgrade the technical capability of their installed base to permit production of high density disks for perpendicular recording rather than the current longitudinal technology 
we currently have nineteen lean systems in backlog  which are scheduled for revenue recognition during the first half of although future customers orders are not guaranteed  our outlook for the equipment business in is positive and we expect our revenues will grow relative to the decrease in imaging revenues in was the result of a reduction in the level of orders received for funded development programs 
a number of the us military programs in which we participate have experienced delays in either start up or follow on funding 
the decrease in imaging revenues in as compared to was primarily the result of an increase in cost shared development programs  especially our military head mounted display development activities 
in  we expect the imaging business revenue to grow  with increases in both contract research and development revenue and product revenue  although we don t anticipate our imaging business will be profitable in substantial growth in future imaging revenues is dependent on proliferation of our technology into major military weapons programs  the ability to obtain export licenses for foreign customers  obtaining production subcontracts for these programs  and development and sale of commercial products 
our backlog of orders at december  was million  as compared to a december  backlog of million 
as of february   we have announced additional orders for two lean systems 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of equipment backlog and million of imaging backlog 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of equipment backlog and million of imaging backlog 
the increase in equipment backlog was primarily the result of orders for lean disk sputtering systems that are scheduled for either customer acceptance or delivery during the first half of significant portions of our revenues in any particular period have been attributable to sales to a limited number of customers 
in sales to seagate  our japanese distributor  matsubo  hitachi global storage technologies and maxtor each accounted for more than of our revenues  and in aggregate accounted for of revenues 
in  seagate and matsubo each accounted for more than of our revenues  and in aggregate accounted for of revenues 
in  komag  seagate  lockheed martin and matsubo  each accounted for more than of our revenues  and in aggregate accounted for of revenues 
our largest customers tend to change from period to period 
international sales totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively  accounting for   and of net revenues 
international revenues include products shipped to overseas operations of us companies 
the increase in international sales in and in was primarily due to an increase in net revenues from disk sputtering systems 
substantially all of our international sales are to customers in the far east 
our mix of domestic versus international sales will change from period to period depending on the location of our largest customers in each period

equipment gross margin improved by eight points or in due primarily to lower manufacturing costs and a higher average selling price for lean systems 
the flat panel manufacturing system recognized for revenue in was originally shipped in and contributed minimal gross profit 
equipment gross margin was adversely impacted by costs incurred during the rapid production  installation and start up of the initial production run of lean systems  by costs for scrap  rework and inventory obsolescence  related primarily to design changes on our lean system  and by favorable pricing offered to our first lean customer 
this was partially offset by higher margins on revenue from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts 
equipment gross margin in was negatively impacted by poor margins achieved on the five d star disposition system upgrades recognized for revenue and the sale of one used disk sputtering system at a reduced price 
we expect the gross margin for the equipment business to improve in  primarily as a result of continued cost reduction efforts undertaken on the lean system  partially offset by the recording of stock based compensation expense 
gross margins in the equipment business will vary depending on a number of factors  including product cost  system configuration and pricing  factory utilization  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
imaging gross margin improved by three points or in due primarily to a reduction in cost shared research and development contracts 
imaging gross margin was negatively impacted by our military head mounted display development program 
the initial phase of this program was partially funded by the us government and our nato customer 
the portion of this cost shared program being funded by intevac is reported in cost of sales  and as a result  this program made a negative contribution to gross profit in imaging gross margin in was derived from fully funded  rather than cost shared  research and development contracts and from the sale of prototype products 
we expect imaging gross margin to improve in  relative to  due primarily to an increase in product revenue  partially offset by the recording of stock based compensation expense

research and development spending increased in as compared to in both equipment and in imaging 
in equipment  spending on the development of a new product line increased significantly  including the cost of constructing the first engineering prototype system 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in spending for disk sputtering equipment 
the increase in imaging was due to spending on the design of a proprietary cmos sensor for use in our military low light level cameras and spending on our commercial imaging products 

table of contents engineering headcount increased from at the end of to at the end of research and development spending declined in as compared to due to a reduction in spending for imaging products and flat panel manufacturing equipment  partially offset by increased spending for the development of disk manufacturing equipment and the initiation of a project to develop a new equipment product line 
we expect that research and development spending will increase significantly in due primarily to expenditures related to our potential new equipment product line  the addition of key engineering personnel and the recording of stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses do not include costs of million  million and million in   and  respectively  which are related to contract research and development and included in cost of net revenues

domestic sales and international sales of disk manufacturing products in the far east  with the exception of japan  are typically made by intevac s direct sales force  whereas  sales in japan of disk manufacturing products and other products are typically made by our japanese distributor  matsubo  who provides services such as sales  installation  warranty and customer support 
we also have subsidiaries in singapore and in hong kong  along with field offices in japan and in shenzhen  china to support our customers in southeast asia 
the increase in selling  general and administrative spending in was primarily the result of increases in costs related to customer service and support in the equipment business  provisions for employee profit sharing and bonus plans and costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance activities 
our selling  general and administrative headcount increased from at the end of to at the end of the increase in over was primarily the result of increases in marketing and business development headcount and sarbanes oxley compliance activities  partially offset by a reduction of surplus facility costs being recorded in selling  general and administrative expense 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in over the amount spent in due primarily to a projected increase in costs related to customer service and support for the equipment business  the addition of key business development personnel and the recording of stock based compensation expense
