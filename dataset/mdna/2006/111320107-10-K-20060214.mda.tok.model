net revenue 
we sell our products to leading manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment in each of our target markets 
because we leverage our technologies across different markets  certain of our integrated circuits may be incorporated into equipment used in multiple markets 
we utilize independent foundries to manufacture all of our semiconductor products 
our net revenue is generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
such sales represented approximately  and of our total net revenue in  and  respectively 
we derive the remaining balance of our net revenue predominantly from software licenses  development agreements  support and maintenance agreements and cancellation fees 
the majority of our sales occur through the efforts of our direct sales force 
sales made through distributors represented approximately  and of our total net revenue in  and  respectively 
the increase in was the result of more of our solutions being sold through distributors in asia 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and wired and wireless communications markets  our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  market and transition to volume production new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory  seasonality in the demand for consumer products into which our solutions are incorporated  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
from time to time  our key customers place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect that these fluctuations will continue and that they may be exaggerated by the increasing volume of broadcom solutions that are incorporated into consumer products  sales of which are typically subject to greater seasonality and greater volume fluctuations than non consumer oem products 

table of contents sales to our five largest customers  including sales to their manufacturing subcontractors  as a percentage of net revenue were as follows years ended december  motorola hewlett packard dell five largest customers as a group less than of net revenue 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue in and for the foreseeable future 
the identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net revenue have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
net revenue derived from all independent customers located outside the united states  excluding foreign subsidiaries or manufacturing subcontractors of customers that are headquartered in the united states  as a percentage of total net revenue was as follows years ended december  asia primarily in taiwan  korea and china europe primarily in france and the united kingdom other net revenue derived from shipments to international destinations  primarily to asia  represented approximately  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
all of our revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
gross margin 
our gross margin  or gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following our product mix and volume of product sales  stock based compensation expense  the position of our products in their respective life cycles  the effects of competition  the effects of competitive pricing programs  manufacturing cost efficiencies and inefficiencies  fluctuations in direct product costs such as wafer pricing and assembly  packaging and testing costs  and overhead costs such as prototyping expenses  product warranty costs  provisions for excess or obsolete inventories  amortization of purchased intangible assets  and licensing and royalty arrangements 
net income loss 
our net income loss has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangible assets  in process research and development  or ipr d  
table of contents settlement costs  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  income tax benefits from adjustments to tax reserves of foreign subsidiaries  gain loss on strategic investments  stock option exchange expense  and restructuring costs or reversals thereof 
in our net income was approximately million as compared to million in  a difference of million 
this improvement in profitability in was the direct result of a improvement in net revenue and a percentage point improvement in gross margin 
this resulted in an increase of million in gross profit 
in addition  we had reductions in in stock based compensation expense  ipr d  impairment of intangible assets and provision for income taxes  aggregating approximately million  offset by an increase in settlement costs of approximately million 
product cycles 
the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than six months  with an additional three to more than nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  selling  general and administrative efforts  and investments in inventory  to the time we generate corresponding revenue  if any 
the rate of new orders may vary significantly from month to month and quarter to quarter 
if anticipated sales or shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
acquisition strategy 
an element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings  augment our engineering workforce  and or enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including acquisitions and other business combination transactions  strategic relationships  capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets 
in  and we completed eleven acquisitions for original aggregate equity consideration of million and cash consideration of million 
in we acquired alliant networks  inc  a developer of wlan embedded software  zeevo  inc  a developer of bluetooth headset chipsets  siliquent technologies inc  a developer of gigabit ethernet server controllers  and athena semiconductors  inc  a developer of mobile digital television tuner and low power wi fi technology 
in we acquired raidcore  inc  a developer of redundant array of inexpensive disks  or raid  and virtualization software  sand video  inc  a developer of advanced video compression semiconductor technology  m stream  inc  a developer of technology for signal to noise ratio performance improvements in cellular handsets  widcomm  inc  a provider of software solutions for bluetooth wireless products  zyray wireless inc  a developer of baseband co processors addressing umts mobile devices  and alphamosaic limited  a developer of advanced mobile imaging  multimedia and d graphics technology optimized for use in cellular phones and other mobile devices 
in we acquired certain assets of gadzoox networks  inc  a provider of storage networking technology 
because each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase transaction  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
business enterprise segments 
we operate in one reportable operating segment  wired and wireless broadband communications 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas  establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
sfas also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
although we had four operating segments at december   under the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas we operate in only one reportable operating segment  wired and wireless broadband communications 

table of contents under sfas  two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas  if the segments have similar economic characteristics  and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas the nature of products and services  the nature of the production processes  the type or class of customer for their products and services  and the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services 
we meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons the sale of integrated circuits is the only material source of revenue for each of our four operating segments  the integrated circuits sold by each of our operating segments use the same standard cmos manufacturing processes  the integrated circuits marketed by each of our operating segments are sold to one type of customer manufacturers of wired and wireless communications equipment  which incorporate our integrated circuits into their electronic products  and all of our integrated circuits are sold through a centralized sales force and common wholesale distributors 
all of our operating segments share similar economic characteristics as they have a similar long term business model  operate at similar gross margins  and have similar research and development expenses and similar selling  general and administrative expenses 
the causes for variation among each of our operating segments are the same and include factors such as i life cycle and price and cost fluctuations  ii number of competitors  iii product differentiation and iv size of market opportunity 
additionally  each operating segment is subject to the overall cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
the number and composition of employees and the amounts and types of tools and materials required are similar for each operating segment 
finally  even though we periodically reorganize our operating segments based upon changes in customers  end markets or products  acquisitions  long term growth strategies  and the experience and bandwidth of the senior executives in charge  the common financial goals for each operating segment remain constant 
because we meet each of the criteria set forth in sfas and our four operating segments as of december  share similar economic characteristics  we aggregate our results of operations into one reportable operating segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  stock based compensation expense  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuations  strategic investments  deferred income tax asset valuation allowances  restructuring costs  litigation and other loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements net revenue we recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
however  
table of contents we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met  when applicable 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
product revenue on sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements  when applicable  are used to verify product delivery or that services have been rendered 
we assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
sales returns and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs and rebates  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory and warranty reserves 
we establish inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
our products typically carry a one to three year warranty 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  product recalls  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure  as well as possible claims for consequential costs 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
in that event  our gross profit and gross margins would be reduced 
stock based compensation expense for and thereafter 
effective january  we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to stock based awards  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use the implied volatility for traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the implied volatility approach is based on the availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock as we believe that implied volatility is more representative than historical volatility 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options and stock purchase rights 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the 
table of contents fair market value of our class a common stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements in and thereafter is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the amount of stock based compensation expense in and thereafter will be reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact of sfas assuming the application of the black scholes option pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii another significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
deferred taxes and tax contingencies 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result of our cumulative losses in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions and the full utilization of our loss carryback opportunities  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate in such jurisdictions 
in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
we record estimated income tax liabilities to the extent they are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in 
table of contents which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
litigation and settlement costs 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we prosecute and defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past infringement or one time license fees or running royalties  which could adversely impact gross profit and gross margins in future periods  or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products or limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for broadcom 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs

net revenue 
our revenue is generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
net revenue is revenue less reductions for rebates and provisions for returns and allowances 
the following table presents net revenue from each of our major target markets and their respective contributions to the increase in net revenue in as compared to years ended december  of net of net increase amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages enterprise networking broadband communications mobile and wireless net revenue the decrease in net revenue from our enterprise networking target market resulted primarily from the previously anticipated decline in shipments of our intel processor based server chipsets  which resulted in a million decrease in net revenue for those products  offset by an increase in net revenue for our enterprise ethernet and controller products 
the increase in net revenue from our broadband communications target market resulted primarily from an increase in net revenue from solutions for broadband modems 
the increase in net revenue from our mobile and wireless target market resulted primarily from strength in our bluetooth and mobile multimedia product offerings  partially offset by weakness in our cellular handset and wireless lan businesses in the first half of our enterprise networking products include ethernet transceivers  controllers  switches  broadband network and security processors  server chipsets and storage products 
our broadband communications products include solutions for cable modems  dsl applications  digital cable  direct broadcast satellite and ip set top boxes  digital tvs and hd dvd and personal video recording devices 
our mobile and wireless products include wireless lan  cellular  bluetooth  mobile multimedia and voip solutions 

table of contents the following table presents net revenue from each of our major target markets and their respective contributions to the increase in net revenue in the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of three months ended three months ended december  september  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue increase change in thousands  except percentages enterprise networking broadband communications mobile and wireless net revenue the increase in net revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of shipments of our semiconductor products stemming from the rise in demand for our products in each of our major target markets 
the increase in net revenue in our enterprise networking target market resulted primarily from an increase in net revenue from our enterprise ethernet products 
the increase in net revenue from our mobile and wireless target market resulted primarily from strength in our bluetooth and mobile multimedia product offerings 
we currently anticipate that total net revenue in the first quarter of will be approximately million to million  as compared to million in net revenue achieved in the fourth quarter of in the first quarter of  we expect to see this increase distributed across all three of our major target markets  with the strongest growth expected to come from our broadband communications target market 
we recorded rebates to certain customers in the amounts of million and million in and  respectively 
we account for rebates in accordance with fasb emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  and  accordingly  record reductions to revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based upon the terms included in our various rebate agreements 
historically  reversals of rebate accruals have not been material 
we anticipate that accrued rebates will vary in future periods based on the level of overall sales to customers that participate in our rebate programs and as specific rebate programs contractually end and unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment 
however  we do not expect rebates to impact our gross margin as our prices to these customers and corresponding revenue and margins are already net of such rebates 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
cost of revenue includes the cost of purchasing the finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries  costs associated with our purchase of assembly  test and quality assurance services and packaging materials for semiconductor products  prototyping costs  amortization of purchased technology  and manufacturing overhead  including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support  product warranty costs and provisions for excess or obsolete inventories 
gross profit represents net revenue less the cost of revenue and less stock based compensation expense for personnel engaged in manufacturing support 
the increase in gross profit resulted primarily from the increase in net revenue 
gross margin increased from in to in the primary factors that contributed to this percentage point improvement were improvements in product margin due to i changes in product mix  ii benefits from the favorable foundry pricing we were able to negotiate at the beginning of and iii other product cost savings  particularly in the area of yield improvements 
in addition  gross margin increased due to a decrease in provisions for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty costs as compared to

we anticipate that our gross margin in the first quarter of may be flat or decrease slightly compared to the fourth quarter of our gross margin may also be impacted by additional stock based compensation expense  as discussed below  and the amortization of purchased intangible assets related to future acquisitions 
effective january  we adopted sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values 
the balance of unearned stock based compensation to be included in cost of revenue in the period through related to share based awards unvested at december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas  is approximately million 
the weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately two years 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our cost of revenue will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
we anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in the second quarter of as part of our regular annual equity compensation focal review program 
the value of these grants is not included in the amount above  and the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted as part of the focal review program and the then current fair values

for a further discussion of stock based compensation expense  see the section entitled research and development and selling  general and administrative expense stock based compensation expense below 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware  prototyping costs  subcontracting costs and facilities expenses 
amounts associated with stock based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development are shown separately 
research and development expense does not include amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets related to research and development activities 
the increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from an increase of million in personnel related expenses 
the increase in personnel related expenses is attributable to an increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities in  resulting from both direct hiring and acquisitions  as well as increased cash compensation levels 
based upon past experience  we anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase over the long term as a result of the growth and diversification of the markets we serve  new product opportunities  changes in our compensation policies and any expansion into new markets and technologies 
we anticipate that research and development expense in the first quarter of will increase from the million incurred in the fourth quarter of we remain committed to significant research and development efforts to extend our technology leadership in the wired and wireless communications markets in which we operate 
we hold more than  us patents  and we maintain an active program of filing for and acquiring additional us and foreign patents in wired and wireless communications and other fields 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses  communications expenses and advertising expenses 
amounts associated with stock based compensation expense for selling  general and administrative employees are shown separately 
selling  general and administrative expense does not include amounts associated with amortization of purchased intangible assets related to selling  general and administrative activities 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense resulted primarily from an increase of million in personnel related expenses 
this increase in personnel related expenses is attributable to an increase in the number of employees engaged in selling  general and administrative activities in  resulting from both direct hiring and acquisitions  as well as increased cash compensation levels 
based upon past experience  we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expense will continue to increase over the long 
table of contents term to support any expansion of our operations through periodic changes in our infrastructure  changes in our compensation policies  acquisition and integration activities  international operations  and current and future litigation 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expense in the first quarter of will increase from the million incurred in the fourth quarter of research and development and selling  general and administrative expense stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense generally represents the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from restricted stock units issued to employees and unvested equity compensation instruments assumed in acquisitions 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable unvested securities  generally four years 
during we recorded approximately million of deferred compensation primarily related to the issuance of approximately million restricted stock units in connection with our regular annual equity compensation review for employees as well as for new hire grants 
this deferred compensation is being amortized ratably over the vesting periods of the underlying restricted stock units  generally quarters 
the decrease in research and development stock based compensation expense in related primarily to a reduction in the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from assumed unvested equity compensation instruments becoming fully vested and the elimination of deferred compensation as a result of the termination of employment of certain employees  partially offset by the amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the issuance of restricted stock units in effective january  we adopted sfas r 
the balance of unearned stock based compensation to be included in research and development and selling  general and administrative expense in the period through related to share based awards unvested at december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas  is approximately million and million  respectively 
the weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately two years 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our operating expenses will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
we anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in the second quarter of as part of our regular annual equity compensation focal review program 
the value of these grants is not included in the amount above  and the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted as part of the focal review program and the then current fair values

settlement costs we recorded million in settlement costs in primarily related to the settlement of securities class action litigation against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
we recorded million in settlement costs in of that amount million was related to the settlement of various litigation matters  and the remaining million reflected settlement costs related to a claim arising from an acquisition and certain indemnification costs

the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed

to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method an interpretation of fasb 
table of contents statement no 
 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria were charged to expense as part of the allocation of purchase price 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles and market penetration and growth rates 
the ipr d charges include only the fair value of ipr d performed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the fair value of developed technology is included in identifiable purchased intangible assets 
we believe the amounts recorded as ipr d  as well as developed technology  represent the fair values and approximate the amounts an independent party would pay for these projects at the time of the respective acquisition dates 
the following table summarizes the significant assumptions at the acquisition dates underlying the valuations of ipr d for our acquisitions completed in and weighted average average risk estimated estimated estimated adjusted percent time to cost to discount company acquired development projects complete complete complete rate ipr d in years in millions in millions acquisitions zeevo bluetooth wireless audio chipset siliquent gbe server controller athena tuners and low power wi fi acquisitions raidcore raid software stack sand video decoder codec chips m stream algorithm implemented in dsp chip zyray umts baseband co processor alphamosaic multimedia co processor we completed the development projects related to all of our acquisitions  except for sand video 
in the case of sand video  we reallocated the resources to focus on semiconductor products that we believe are a higher priority 
we also completed the development project related to the zeevo acquisition 
all other development projects are still in process 
except for the sand video project  actual results to date have been consistent  in all material respects  with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates for the ipr d projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projections for the products once they have entered the market 
as of the respective acquisition dates of the and acquisitions  certain ongoing development projects were in process 
research and development costs to bring the products of the acquired companies to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the following table presents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets for and years ended december  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue decrease change in thousands  except percentages impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets we performed annual impairment assessments of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in connection with various acquisitions as required under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  in october and upon completion of the and annual impairment assessments  we determined no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair values of our four reporting units  determined and identified in accordance with sfas  exceeded their respective carrying values 
we estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method  taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as verification of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete four year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes and consistent with those distributed to our board of directors 
cash flows beyond the four year discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal value calculation  which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each identified reporting unit and considered long term earnings growth rates for publicly traded peer companies 
future cash flows were discounted to present value by incorporating the present value techniques discussed in fasb concepts statement  using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements  or concepts statement specifically  the income approach valuations included reporting unit cash flow discount rates ranging from to  and terminal value growth rates ranging from to 
publicly available information regarding the market capitalization of our company was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units estimated using the discounted cash flow methodology 
in november we acquired an issued us patent  with various foreign counterparts  related to integrated circuit package testing for million 
in january we acquired approximately patents and patent applications related to the read channel and hard disk controller market for million 
the immediate purpose for acquiring these patent portfolios was to assist us in the defense and settlement of then ongoing and future intellectual property litigation 
as a result  we were unable to estimate any future cash flows from the patents 
we also did not have any plans to resell the patents to a third party 
due to our intended use for these assets  we concluded that indicators of impairment existed upon acquisition of the patents because the carrying value of the patents might not be recoverable 
upon determining that indicators of impairment existed  we performed recoverability tests in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of long lived assets should include only the future cash flows that are directly associated with  and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
the only cash flows expected to arise as a direct result of the use of the patents are the cash savings expected to result from reduced but undeterminable litigation expenses over the next several years 
due to the unpredictable nature of legal disputes  it is not possible to reasonably i determine if our strategy with respect to the patents will be successful  ii forecast litigation expenses that would have been incurred if the patent portfolio was not acquired  or iii forecast cash flows generated as a result of acquiring the patents 
as a result  no reasonable analysis could be prepared to support future cash flows associated with the patents 
accordingly  pursuant to sfas the patents were determined to be fully impaired at their respective dates of acquisition 
the impairment charge for the patent portfolio was classified as an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the consolidated statements of operations in

in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
sfas further states that forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
as a result our recent cumulative losses in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  and the full utilization of its loss carryback

table of contents in we increased our provision for excess and obsolete inventory as compared to as a result of an increase in gross inventory 
the primary factors that resulted in increased inventory were the expansion of inventory in response to higher levels of purchase orders received from our customers  shorter lead times for certain of our customers  and the buildup of buffer inventory based upon our forecast of future demand for certain key products 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense related primarily to stock option exchange expense of approximately million recorded in  as well as a reduction in the number of assumed unvested options and shares of restricted stock being amortized and the elimination of deferred compensation as a result of the termination of employment of certain employees

share and per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have not been restated to reflect this pending stock split 
pending acquisition in january we announced that we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire sandburst corporation  a privately held fabless semiconductor company specializing in the design and development of scalable packet switching and routing systems on a chip socs that are deployed in enterprise core and metropolitan ethernet networks 
we expect to pay total consideration of approximately million in connection with the acquisition 
of such consideration  million will be paid in cash upon closing of the acquisition in exchange for all outstanding shares of capital stock and vested stock options of sandburst 
a portion of the cash consideration will be placed in escrow pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement 
broadcom will also assume all unvested employee stock options of sandburst  which will entitle the holders to receive  upon vesting  up to approximately  shares of broadcom class a common stock  having a total value of approximately million based upon the terms of the acquisition agreement

recent accounting pronouncements in december the fasb issued sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values and does not allow the previously permitted disclosure only method as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
effective january  we adopted sfas r 
we plan to use the modified prospective method of recognition of compensation expense related to share based payments 
the adoption of the sfas r fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the balance of unearned stock based compensation to be included in the period through related to share based awards unvested at december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas  is approximately million 
the weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately two years 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
we anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in the second quarter of as part of our regular annual equity compensation focal review program 
the fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above  as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted as part of the focal review program and the then current fair values 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact of sfas assuming the application of the black scholes option pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of 
table of contents tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after its adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in related to such excess tax deductions was million 
no comparable amounts were recorded in or liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash and marketable securities 
the following table presents working capital and cash and marketable securities december  december  increase decrease in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities included in working capital 
our working capital increased in primarily related to cash provided by operations and cash proceeds received from issuances of common stock in connection with the exercise of employee stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  offset in part by cash paid to settle our securities class action litigation  the purchase of long term marketable securities and property and equipment  acquisitions  and repurchases of our class a common stock 
cash provided and used in and cash and cash equivalents increased to billion at december  from million at december  as a result of cash provided by operating and financing activities  offset in part by cash used in investing activities 
in our operating activities provided million in cash 
this was primarily the result of million in net income and million in net non cash operating expenses  offset in part by net cash used of million in changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items included in net income include depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangible assets  ipr d  impairment of intangible assets and gains on strategic investments 
in our operating activities provided million in cash

non cash items included in net income include depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangible assets  ipr d  impairment of intangible assets  tax benefit from stock plans and gains on strategic investments 
accounts receivable increased million from million in to million in the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of the million increase in net revenue in the fourth quarter of to million  as compared with million in the fourth quarter of we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms 
if  in the longer term  our revenue continues to increase as it has in the most recent past  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could also increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers 
inventories increased million  from million in to million in  primarily in response to higher levels of purchase orders received from our customers and the buildup of buffer inventories based upon our forecast of future demand for certain key products 
in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined based on the level of purchase orders received as well as the stage at which our 
table of contents products are in their respective product life cycles and competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
investing activities used cash of million in  which was primarily the result of million net cash paid in acquisitions  the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations  million used in the net purchase of marketable securities and the purchase of million of strategic investments  offset by million in net proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments 
investing activities used cash of million in  which was primarily the result of million used in the net purchase of marketable securities  million net cash paid in acquisitions  the purchase of million of capital equipment to support our operations and the purchase of million of strategic investments  offset by million in net proceeds received from the sale of strategic investments 
our financing activities provided million in cash in  which was primarily the result of million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  offset in part by million in repurchases of our class a common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program implemented in february and million for the repayment of debt assumed in connection with an acquisition 
our financing activities provided million in cash in  which was primarily the result of million in net proceeds received from issuances of common stock upon exercises of stock options and pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
in january  we amended our share repurchase program to authorize repurchases of class a common stock having an aggregate market value of up to million from time to time during the period beginning january  and ending january   depending on market conditions and other factors 
due to the increase in the price of our class a common stock  a greater number of stock options were exercised by employees  and we received more proceeds from the exercise of stock options  in than in the timing and number of stock option exercises and the amount of cash proceeds we receive through those exercises are not within our control  and in the future we may not generate as much cash from the exercise of stock options as we have in the past 
moreover  it is now our practice to issue a combination of restricted stock units and stock options to employees  which will reduce future growth in the number of stock options available for exercise 
unlike the exercise of stock options  the issuance of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units does not result in any cash proceeds to broadcom and requires the use of cash as we determined to allow employees to elect to have a portion of the shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units during and withheld to satisfy withholding taxes and to make corresponding cash payments to the appropriate tax authorities on each employee s behalf 
in january we received approximately million from the exercise of stock options 
the effects of those exercises are not included in our financial position as of december  obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and commitments as of december  payment obligations by year there after total in thousands operating leases inventory and related purchase obligations other purchase obligations restructuring liabilities accrued settlement payments total we lease our facilities and certain engineering design tools and information systems equipment under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through in december we entered into a lease 
table of contents agreement under which our corporate headquarters will move from its present location to new facilities in irvine  california with an aggregate of approximately million square feet 
the lease term is for a period of ten years and two months beginning after the completion of the first two buildings and related tenant improvements  which is anticipated to occur in the first quarter of the aggregate rent for the term of the lease  approximately million  is included in the table above 
inventory and related purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for silicon wafers and assembly and test services 
we depend upon third party subcontractors to manufacture our silicon wafers and provide assembly and test services 
due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order these materials and services from subcontractors well in advance 
we expect to receive and pay for these materials and services within the ensuing six months 
our subcontractor relationships typically allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders  but require payment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation 
other purchase obligations represent purchase commitments for lab test equipment  computer hardware  and information systems infrastructure  and other purchase commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
our restructuring liabilities represent estimated future lease and operating costs from restructured facilities  less offsetting sublease income  if any 
these costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
settlement payments represent payments to be made in connection with certain settlement and license agreements entered into in and these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
for purposes of the table above  obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within a relatively short time horizon 
we have additional purchase orders not included in the table above that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventories or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
prospective capital needs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash generated from operations and from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  commitments and repurchases of our class a common stock for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we have in effect a universal shelf registration statement on sec form s that allows us to sell  in one or more public offerings  shares of our class a common stock  shares of preferred stock or debt securities  or any combination of such securities  for proceeds in an aggregate amount of up to million 
however  we have not issued nor do we have immediate plans to issue securities under the universal shelf registration statement 
if we elect to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
although we believe that we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
we anticipate that the amount of capital we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  and product and technology roadmaps

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december  the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
our marketable securities  consisting of us treasury and agency obligations  commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  time deposits  foreign notes and certificates of deposits  are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
in addition  in the past certain of our short term marketable securities were classified as available for sale and were stated at fair value  which was equal to cost due to the short term maturity of these securities 
in the event that there were to be a difference between fair value and cost in any of our available for sale securities  unrealized gains and losses on these investments would be reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our investment policy for marketable securities requires that all securities mature in three years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than months 
as of december  the carrying value and fair value of these securities were approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our marketable securities fluctuates based on changes in market conditions and interest rates  however  given the short term maturities  we do not believe these instruments are subject to significant market or interest rate risk 
the carrying value  maturity and estimated fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and  respectively  were as follows carrying fair value maturity value december  december  in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate marketable securities weighted average interest rate carrying fair value maturity value december  december  in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate marketable securities weighted average interest rate our strategic equity investments are generally classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for our publicly traded investments 
we have also invested in privately held companies  the majority of which can still be considered to be in the start up or development stage 
we make investments in key business partners and other industry participants to establish strategic relationships  expand existing relationships  and achieve a return on our investment 
these investments are inherently risky  as the markets for the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize
