inflation inflation has had and is expected to have only a minor effect on the company s operating results and its sources of liquidity 
inflation  including as it related to the increased cost of fuel and plastic materials  did not significantly impact the company s operating results and its sources of liquidity in  and significant accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements prepaid catalog costs and amortization the company accumulates all direct costs  less applicable vendor rebates  incurred in the development  production and circulation of catalogs on the consolidated balance sheets until the related catalog is mailed  at which time such catalog costs are amortized into selling and administrative expense over the estimated sales realization cycle of one year  using the straight line method 
deferred income taxes at december   the consolidated balance sheet contains a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of approximately million  related primarily to federal net operating tax loss carryforwards 
the realizability of this asset is dependent upon the company s generation of sufficient levels of future taxable income and the ability to retain its federal net operating tax loss carryforward position 
as of december   the company had federal net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately million 
based upon projected future operating results  federal net operating tax loss carryforwards of million are expected to be utilized to offset future federal taxable income primarily through the remaining million of federal net operating tax loss carryforwards may  therefore  expire unused 
events may limit the use o f all or a portion of these federal net operating tax loss carryforwards  thus potentially resulting in a higher tax liability for the company in the future 
the net deferred tax asset  including the valuation allowance  at december  is subject to future adjustment based upon changes in management s evaluation of the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
goodwill the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  by applying a fair value based test and  if impairment occurs  the amount of impaired goodwill is written off immediately 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment based on the expected future cash flows or earnings projections 
goodwill is deemed impaired if the estimated discounted cash flows or earnings projections do not substantiate the carrying value 
the estimation of such amounts requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital and selection of an appropriate discount rate  as applicable 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease discounted future operating cash flows or earnings projections and could  therefore  change impairment determination 
the company eva luated its goodwill at december  and  and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
defined benefit plans the company accounts for the benefits under its defined benefit pension plan using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas 
these models use an attribution approach that generally spreads individual events over the service lives of the employees in the plan 
examples of events are plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increases 
the principle underlying the required attribution approach is that employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis and  therefore  the statement of earnings effects of pension benefits are earned in  and should be expensed in  the same pattern 
in calculating the net periodic benefit cost and the related benefit obligation  the company is required to select certain actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate assumptions reflect the prevailing market rates for long term  high quality  fixed income debt instruments that  if the obligation was settled at the measurement date  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due 
the company uses long term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plan s assets  as well as future estimates of long term investment returns  to develop its assumptions of the expected return on plan assets 
the rate of compensation increase is based on historical experience and the company s long term plans for such increases 
in each of and  a basis point decline in the discount rate assumptions caused a decrease in the funded status of the company s pension plan 
consequently  accumulated benefit obligation of the company s pension plan exceeded the fair market value of the plan assets at december  and as required by sfas  the company recorded a minimum pension liability and recognized related non cash  after tax  net charges of 
million and 
million to the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive earnings in the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
these charges did not impact the company s pension expense  earnings or cash contribution requirements in or on december   the company froze the plan benefits for all hourly employees and certain salaried employees 
see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a more complete discussion of the company s defined benefit pension plan 
revenues customarily applying fob shipping point terms  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of products to its customers  which corresponds to the time when risk of ownership transfers

all drop shipment sales are recorded at gross selling price 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements for in december  the fasb issued a revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services and incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services 
sfas r requires a company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  such as stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize these awards as an expense in the statement of earnings over the requisite service period 
the grant date fair value of employee stock options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which was issued in october sfas r is effective for all awards granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after june  sfas r provides for methods of applying this statement to existing awards during the transitional period 
the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which clarifies that abnormal costs of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material should be recognized as current period expenses

sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
interpretation r replaces interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january the company was required to apply interpretation r to interests in variable interest entities vie created after december  for variable interests in a vie created before january   the interpretation was applied beginning on january  if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date interpretation r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling i nterest of the vie 
the adoption of interpretation r did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements for item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and debt 
as described below  credit risk  market risk and interest rate risk are the primary sources of risk in the company s accounts receivable  investments and debt 
qualitative credit risk the company provides credit in the normal course of business to its customers  which are primarily educational institutions or distributors 
no single customer accounted for more than of the company s sales in  or the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers  maintains allowances for potential credit losses and generally does not require collateral to support its accounts receivable balances 
market risk the company s exposure to market risk relates to the quality of holdings of its limited partnership investment 
the fair market value of the limited partnership s investments is subject to increases or decreases in value resulting from the performance of the securities issuers  from upgrades or downgrades in the credit worthiness of the securities issuers and from changes in general market conditions 
the company seeks to manage its exposure to market risk by investing in accordance with standards established by the investment committee of the board of directors 
the standards of the investment committee are i preservation of capital  ii provision of adequate liquidity to meet projected cash requirements  iii minimization of risk of principal loss through diversified short and medium term investments  and iv maximization of yields in relationship to the guidelines  risk  market conditi ons and tax considerations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates can potentially impact the company s profitability and its ability to realize assets and satisfy liabilities 
interest rate risk is resident primarily in debt  which typically has variable interest rates based on prime or libor rates 
assuming no other change in financial structure  an increase of in the company s variable interest rate for debt would decrease pre tax earnings for by approximately 
million 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of a increase in interest rates on the average debt estimated to be outstanding in quantitative the company s debt as of december  is as follows in millions  except percentage data maturity less than one year maturity greater than one year amount weighted average interest rate fair market value the fair market value of debt equals the face amount of debt outstanding because the underlying rate of interest on substantially all of the company s debt is variable based upon prime or libor rates
