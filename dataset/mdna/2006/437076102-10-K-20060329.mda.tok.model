additionally  we recorded million of expense in cost of sales related to inventory markdowns in fiscal affected expo customers are being served by existing the home depot and expo stores

we believe the selected sales data  the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in the consolidated statements of earnings and the percentage change in the dollar amounts of each of the items presented as follows is important in evaluating the performance of our business operations

comparable store sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales or net earnings presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion for fiscal fiscal net sales growth was driven by an increase in comparable store sales of  sales from new stores opened during fiscal and fiscal and sales from our newly acquired businesses 
assuming the acquisition of hughes supply closes in the first quarter of  we expect sales growth of to for fiscal  driven by comparable store sales growth  sales from new stores opened during fiscal and fiscal and sales from newly acquired businesses  including hughes supply 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal reflects a number of factors 
the retail stores contributed of comparable store sales growth and home depot supply contributed basis points of comparable store sales growth 
in the retail stores  our average ticket  which increased to a record  increased in all selling departments and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal was positive in of selling departments 
building materials had the strongest comparable store sales increase through sales growth of gypsum  roofing  concrete and insulation  due in part to the impact of one of the most destructive hurricane seasons in modern us history 
we experienced strong comparable store sales growth in kitchen and bath driven by continued growth in appliances and kitchen installations 
we also experienced strong comparable store sales in our pro categories  including plumbing  electrical and hardware in fiscal the impact of cannibalization partially offset our fiscal comparable store sales growth 
in order to meet our customer service objectives  we strategically open stores near market areas served by existing stores cannibalize to enhance service levels  gain incremental sales and increase market penetration 
as of the end of fiscal  certain new stores cannibalized approximately of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal comparable store sales by approximately 
additionally  we believe that our sales performance has been  and could continue to be  negatively impacted by the level of competition that we encounter in various markets 
however  due to the highly fragmented us home improvement and professional supply industry  in which we estimate our market share is approximately  measuring the impact on our sales by our competitors is extremely difficult 
the growth in net sales for fiscal reflects growth in services revenue  which increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal the growth in services revenue was driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops  roofing  kitchens  windows and hvac 
we continued to drive our services programs  which focus primarily on providing products and services to our do it for me customers 
we also arrange for the provision of flooring  countertop  cabinet  and window covering installation services to production home builders through our creative touch interiors brand 
our services revenue is expected to benefit from the growing percentage of aging baby boomers as they rely more heavily on installation services 
we continue to invest in our stores to improve store efficiency and the overall customer shopping experience 
in fiscal  we completed the rollout of our back end automation and re engineering bear project to all stores in the us and canada 
among other things  this initiative improves operational execution and productivity through the automation of our receiving process in the stores  enabling us to reallocate resources to the selling floor 
during fiscal  we continued the implementation or expansion of a number of other in store initiatives 
we continued the installation of self checkout registers  in  stores as of the end of fiscal  grew our centralized automatic replenishment program  commenced vendor certification for certified receiving and implemented an in store special order services initiative pilot in stores as of the end of fiscal we believe these initiatives will enhance our customers shopping experience as they are fully implemented in our stores 
gross profit gross profit increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal gross profit as a percent of net sales increased basis points to for fiscal  the highest annual rate in our company s history 
our gross profit margin was impacted by a number of factors during the year including a change in the mix of merchandise sold  markdowns taken in connection with our decision to close or convert expo stores  the increasing penetration of our home depot supply business and the cost of our deferred interest programs 
through our private label credit card we offer no interest no payment programs 
the deferred interest associated with these programs is included in cost of sales 
we believe these programs deliver long term benefits  including higher average ticket and customer loyalty 
for fiscal  the penetration of our private label credit sales was compared to for fiscal operating expenses operating expenses increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal operating expenses as a percent of net sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the reduction of sg a as a percent of net sales for fiscal was primarily a result of continued focus on cost take out initiatives and driving productivity gains throughout the company 
we also continue to see benefits from our private label credit card  which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit  like bank cards 
in fiscal  we recorded million of income related to gift card breakage as a reduction of sg a 
fiscal was the first year in which we recognized gift card breakage  and therefore  the amount recognized in fiscal includes the breakage income related to gift cards sold since the inception of our gift card program 
while we expect to continue to recognize gift card breakage in future periods  the amounts will be significantly less than in fiscal due to the one time multi year inclusion in fiscal finally  for fiscal  we recorded million of impairment charges and expense related to lease obligations in connection with our decision to close or convert expo stores 
depreciation and amortization increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase as a percent of net sales was primarily due to our investments in store modernization and technology 
interest  net in fiscal  we recognized million of net interest expense compared to million in fiscal net interest expense as a percent of net sales was for fiscal and less than for fiscal interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the august billion issuance of senior notes and the september billion issuance of senior notes 
interest and investment income increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to a higher interest rate environment 
provision for income taxes our combined federal and state effective income tax rate increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the majority of the increase in our effective income tax rate was due to an increase in the state effective tax rate in fiscal the american jobs creation act of ajc act provides a one time dividends received deduction that applies to qualified cash dividends received from controlled foreign corporations if the funds are reinvested in the united states 
the deduction can result in an effective income tax rate of on the repatriation of foreign earnings  a rate much lower than the normal statutory tax rate of 
the company has determined that it will not repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries under the ajc act 
the ajc act also provides a new deduction for qualified domestic production activities 
when fully phased in  the deduction will be up to of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
because this provision is targeted toward manufacturing activities  the company does not expect to recognize a material benefit in the current or future tax years 
diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted in both fiscal and fiscal as a result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our billion repurchase authorization 
over the past four fiscal years  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for a total of billion 
on february  our board of directors authorized an additional billion for share repurchases  bringing our total authorization to billion 
in fiscal  we estimate diluted earnings per share growth of to 
fiscal compared to fiscal year ended february  fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal increased to billion from billion for fiscal fiscal net sales growth was driven by an increase in comparable store sales of  sales from the net new stores opened during fiscal  sales from the net new stores opened during fiscal and sales from our newly acquired businesses 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal reflects a number of factors 
our average ticket  which increased to  increased in all selling departments and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal was positive in all selling departments 
we experienced strong comparable store sales increases in building materials due in part to the impact of several hurricanes in the southeastern us lumber was another strong category during fiscal  driven primarily by commodity price inflation 
additionally  we had strong sales growth in our kitchen and bath categories  driven by appliances  bath fixtures  vanities and sinks 
finally  our comparable store sales growth in fiscal reflects the impact of cannibalization 
as of the end of fiscal  certain new stores cannibalized approximately of our existing stores and we estimate that store cannibalization reduced fiscal comparable store sales by approximately 
the growth in net sales for fiscal reflects growth in services revenue  which increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal  driven by strength in a number of areas including countertops  hvac  kitchens and our flooring companies 
gross profit gross profit increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal  an increase of basis points 
gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the adoption of emerging issues task force  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  reduced our cost of sales by co op advertising allowances of million  or basis points  in fiscal and million  or basis points  in fiscal see section impact of the adoption of eitf excluding the impact of the adoption of eitf  our gross profit as a percent of net sales would have been for fiscal compared with for fiscal improved inventory management  which resulted in lower shrink levels  contributed basis points of our increase in gross profit 
finally  basis points resulted from benefits arising from a change in merchandising mix  offset by the cost of our deferred interest programs 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal operating expenses as a percent of net sales were for fiscal compared to for fiscal sg a increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in sg a in fiscal includes billion of advertising expense related to the adoption of eitf excluding the impact of eitf  sg a increased to billion  or of net sales  in fiscal compared with of net sales in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percent of net sales for fiscal  excluding the impact of eitf  was due to an increase in labor productivity and benefits from our private label credit card  which carries a lower discount rate than other forms of credit  like bank cards 
labor productivity  as measured by sales per labor hour  reached an all time high in fiscal  as we moved our associates from tasking to selling activities 
this reduction in costs was partially offset by higher expenses associated with incentive programs  like our success sharing program and our management incentive plan and stock based compensation expense 
in addition  our planned investment in store modernization and technology caused remodel and repair expenses to rise at a faster rate than our net sales growth 
depreciation and amortization increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal depreciation and amortization as a percent of net sales was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to our investment in store modernization and technology 
interest  net in fiscal  we recognized million of net interest expense compared to million in fiscal net interest expense as a percent of net sales was less than for both fiscal and fiscal interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in outstanding indebtedness and a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest 
interest expense also increased due to the addition of million in capital leases during the year 
interest and investment income decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to a lower interest rate environment 
provision for income taxes our combined federal and state effective income tax rate decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the majority of this reduction was due to the reversal of a million valuation allowance as we were able to recognize previous capital losses for which no tax benefit had been recorded at the time the capital loss was incurred 
diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share were and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the adoption of eitf negatively impacted diluted earnings per share for fiscal by per share 
diluted earnings per share were favorably impacted in fiscal as a result of the repurchase of shares of our common stock in fiscal and fiscal impact of the adoption of eitf in fiscal  we adopted eitf which states that certain cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should  therefore  be recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings 
that presumption is overcome when the consideration is either a reimbursement of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendor s products or a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor 
we receive consideration in the form of advertising co op allowances from our vendors pursuant to annual agreements  which are generally on a calendar year basis 
as permitted by eitf  we elected to apply its provisions prospectively to all agreements entered into or modified after december  therefore  the impact of us adopting eitf in fiscal was limited to advertising co op allowances earned pursuant to vendor agreements entered into in late  which became effective in january the one month impact of the adoption of eitf in fiscal resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of million  an increase in sg a of million and a reduction of earnings before provision for income taxes of million 
the impact on our diluted earnings per share was immaterial 
the impact of the adoption of eitf in fiscal resulted in a reduction of cost of sales of million  an increase in sg a of billion and a reduction of earnings before provision for income taxes of million 
the impact on our diluted earnings per share for fiscal was a reduction of per share 
eitf did not have a material impact on our fiscal consolidated results of operations or financial condition as of january  prior to the adoption of eitf in fiscal  the entire amount of advertising co op allowances received was offset against advertising expense and resulted in a reduction of sg a 
we continue to earn certain advertising co op allowances that are recorded as an offset against advertising expenses as they are reimbursements of specific  incremental and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors products 
in fiscal  and  net advertising expense was billion  billion and million  respectively  which was recorded in sg a 
the following table illustrates the full year effect on cost of sales  gross profit  sg a  operating income and diluted earnings per share as if advertising co op allowances had always been treated as a reduction of cost of sales in accordance with eitf amounts in millions  except per share data fiscal year ended january  january  february  cost of sales as reported    pro forma    gross profit as reported    pro forma    selling  general and administrative expenses as reported    pro forma    operating income as reported    pro forma    diluted earnings per share as reported pro forma liquidity and capital resources cash flow generated from operations provides a significant source of liquidity 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was billion as compared to billion for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in deferred income taxes resulting from the reversal of certain temporary differences and no increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by stronger net earnings 
net cash used in investing activities increased to billion for fiscal from billion for fiscal this increase was due to an increase in payments for businesses acquired  partially offset by a decrease in the net proceeds from sales  maturities and purchases of investments 
we paid billion to complete acquisitions in fiscal  primarily adding professional service capabilities to home depot supply 
in january  we announced our intent to acquire hughes supply for aggregate consideration of billion 
we expect to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal additionally in fiscal  we had billion of capital expenditures  allocated as follows for new stores  for store modernization  for technology and for other initiatives 
in fiscal  we opened new stores  including five relocations 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was billion compared with billion for fiscal the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily due to the issuance of billion of long term debt in august and million of short term debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal under our commercial paper program 
in may  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the future issuance of up to billion of debt securities 
in august  we issued billion of senior notes see note in notes to consolidated financial statements at a discount of million 
the net proceeds of million were used to pay for a portion of the acquisition price of national waterworks 
commercial paper borrowings in the fourth quarter of fiscal supported short term liquidity needs 
in february and august  our board of directors authorized an additional billion and billion  respectively  in our share repurchase program  bringing the total authorization by our board of directors since inception of the program in to billion as of january  pursuant to this authorization  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for a total of billion as of january  during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for billion and during fiscal we repurchased million shares of our common stock for billion 
as of january   approximately billion remained under our previously authorized share repurchase program 
subsequent to the end of fiscal  our board of directors authorized an additional billion bringing the total authorization since the inception of the share repurchase program to billion 
during fiscal  we also increased dividends paid by to million from million in fiscal we have a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to a maximum of billion 
in connection with the program  we have a back up credit facility with a consortium of banks for borrowings up to billion 
as of january   there was million outstanding under the program 
we expect to repay this amount during the first quarter of the credit facility  which expires in december  contains various restrictions  none of which is expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources 
we use capital and operating leases to finance a portion of our real estate  including our stores  distribution centers and store support centers 
the net present value of capital lease obligations is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in long term debt 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the operating leases are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of the end of fiscal  our long term debt to equity ratio was compared to at the end of fiscal this increase reflects the net increase in long term debt as a result of the august issuance of senior notes due august  as of january   we had million in cash and short term investments 
we believe that our current cash position and cash flow generated from operations should be sufficient to enable us to complete our capital expenditure programs and any required long term debt payments through the next several fiscal years 
in addition  we have funds available from the billion commercial paper program and the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing for future acquisitions and other requirements 
in march  we used the remaining availability under our shelf registration statement to issue billion of senior notes due march  and billion of senior notes due march  we intend to use the proceeds to fund our pending acquisition of hughes supply and to refinance our million of senior notes due april  the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  amounts in millions payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations total thereafter total debt    capital lease obligations  operating leases     subtotal      amount of commitment expiration per fiscal year commercial commitments total thereafter letters of credit   purchase obligations   subtotal    total      contractual obligations include short term debt  long term debt comprised primarily of billion of senior notes further discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and future minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases used in the normal course of business 
the amounts listed do not include aggregate consideration of billion related to our pending acquisition of hughes supply  expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal or any debt issued subsequent to the end of fiscal excludes present value of capital lease obligations of million 
includes million of interest payments and million of unamortized discount 
includes million of imputed interest 
commercial commitments include letters of credit from certain business transactions  purchase obligations and commitments to purchase store assets 
we issue letters of credit for insurance programs  purchases of import merchandise inventories and construction contracts 
our purchase obligations consist of commitments for both merchandise and services 
purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts such as firm commitments for inventory purchases  utility purchases  capital expenditures  software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts 
purchase orders that are not binding agreements are excluded from the table above 
additionally  we have included a commitment to purchase the underlying asset under an off balance sheet lease related to certain stores for million during quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
although we have international operating entities  our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not significant to our financial condition and results of operations 
our primary objective for entering into derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rates  as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
as of january  we had  net of discounts  million of senior notes  million of senior notes and million of senior notes outstanding 
the market values of the publicly traded  and senior notes as of january   were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we have several outstanding interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling million  that swap fixed rate interest on our million senior notes for variable interest rates equal to libor plus to basis points and expire on april  at january   the fair market value of these agreements was a liability of million  which is the estimated amount that we would have paid to settle similar interest rate agreements at current interest rates 
impact of inflation  deflation and changing prices we have experienced inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity products 
during fiscal  lumber prices decreased our comparable store sales by approximately basis points 
we do not believe that changing prices for other commodities have had a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
although we cannot accurately determine the precise overall effect of inflation and deflation on operations  we do not believe inflation and deflation have had a material effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of estimated returns  at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or receives services 
we estimate the liability for sales returns based on our historical return levels 
the methodology used is consistent with other retailers 
we believe that our estimate for sales returns is an accurate reflection of future returns 
we have never recorded a significant adjustment to our estimated liability for sales returns 
however  if these estimates are significantly below the actual amounts  our sales could be adversely impacted 
when we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is complete 
merchandise inventories our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  with approximately valued under the retail inventory method and the remainder under the cost method 
retailers like the home depot  with many different types of merchandise at low unit cost and a large number of transactions  frequently use the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  merchandise inventories are stated at cost  which is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to the ending retail value of inventories 
as our inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions  our inventory valued under the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate our inventory valued under the cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or market 
the valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under the cost method was not material to the company as of the end of fiscal and fiscal independent physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store  distribution center and home depot supply location to ensure that amounts reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for merchandise inventories are properly stated 
during the period between physical inventory counts in our stores  we accrue for estimated losses related to shrink on a store by store basis 
shrink or in the case of excess inventory  swell is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory 
shrink may occur due to theft  loss  inaccurate records for the receipt of inventory or deterioration of goods  among other things 
we estimate shrink as a percent of net sales using the average shrink results from the previous two physical inventories 
the estimates are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based on recent shrink results and current trends in the business 
self insurance we are self insured for certain losses related to general liability  product liability  automobile  workers compensation and medical claims 
our liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and is reviewed by management and third party actuaries on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information currently available  if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  medical cost inflation  or fluctuations in premiums  differ from our estimates  our results of operations could be impacted 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this statement revises sfas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all public entities to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments as measured by the fair value on the grant date over the requisite service period 
in april  the securities and exchange commission issued guidance delaying the effective date of sfas r  therefore it will now be effective for the home depot in the first quarter of fiscal effective february   we adopted the fair value based method of recording stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas we selected the prospective method of adoption as described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and accordingly  stock based compensation expense was recorded for all share based payments granted or modified after the beginning of fiscal historically  we have used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees 
sfas r requires that all share based payments granted prior to the adoption date that remain unvested at the adoption date also be expensed over the remaining service period 
we currently intend to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method  therefore in addition to continuing to recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payments awarded since our adoption of sfas in fiscal  we will also begin expensing unvested options granted prior to upon the adoption of sfas r 
we currently estimate the impact of adopting sfas r will be a reduction of earnings before provision for income taxes of approximately million for fiscal in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period fsp 
fsp requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations 
fsp becomes effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   and will therefore be effective for the home depot in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of fsp is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
