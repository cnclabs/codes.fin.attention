our fiscal years end on the saturday closest to january as a result  our fiscal  fiscal and fiscal results consisted of weeks 
all references to earnings per share relate to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
we include a store in the calculation of comparable store sales once it has been in operation sixty weeks after its initial opening 
if a store is closed during a fiscal period  the store s sales will be included in the computation of comparable store sales for that fiscal month  quarter and year to date period only for the days in which it was operating as compared to those same days in the comparable period 
relocated  remodeled and expanded square footage stores are classified the same as the original store and are not considered new stores upon relocation  remodeling or completion of their expansion 
however  a store which is temporarily closed while undergoing relocation  remodeling or expansion is excluded from comparable store sales for the related period of closure 

table of contents overview we are a leading global specialty retailer of value priced fashion accessories and jewelry for pre teens and teenagers as well as young adults 
we are organized based on our geographic markets  which include our north american operations and our international operations 
as of january   we operated a total of  stores in all states of the united states  puerto rico  canada  the virgin islands  the united kingdom  switzerland  austria  germany the latter three collectively referred to as sag  france  ireland  spain  holland and belgium 
the stores are operated mainly under the trade names claire s  claire s boutiques  claire s accessories  icing by claire s  afterthoughts and the icing 
we are continuing the process of transitioning our afterthoughts stores to icing by claire s stores to capitalize on the claire s brand name 
we also operated stores in japan through a joint venture with aeon co 
ltd 
claire s nippon 
we account for the results of operations of claire s nippon under the equity method 
these results are included within interest and other income in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income within our north american division 
in addition  we licensed stores in the middle east under a licensing and merchandising agreement with al shaya co 
ltd 
and stores in south africa under similar agreements with the house of busby limited 
we account for the goods we sell under the merchandising agreements within net sales and cost of sales  occupancy and buying expenses in our north american division and the license fees we charge under the licensing agreements within interest and other income within our international division in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
we have two store concepts claire s accessories  which caters to fashion conscious girls and teens in the to age range  and icing by claire s  which caters to fashion conscious teens and young women in the to age range 
our merchandise typically ranges in price between and  with the average product priced at approximately 
our stores share a similar format and our different store concepts and trade names allow us to have multiple store locations within a single mall 
although we face competition from a number of small specialty store chains and others selling fashion accessories  we believe that our stores comprise one of the largest chains of specialty retail stores in the world devoted to the sale of value priced fashion accessories for pre teen  teenage and young adult females 
fundamentally  our business model is to offer the customer a compelling price value relationship and a wide array of products from which to choose 
we seek to deliver a high level of profitability and cash flow by maximizing the effectiveness of our retail product pricing through promotional activity minimizing our product costs through economies of scale as the world s leading mall based retailer of value priced accessories and jewelry reinvesting operating cash flows into opening new stores  remodeling existing stores and infrastructure in order to create future revenues and build brand name loyalty while our financial results have grown steadily  the retail environment remains very competitive 
management s plan for future growth is dependent on successfully identifying merchandise appealing to our customers and managing our inventory levels displaying our merchandise at convenient  accessible locations staffed with personnel that provide courteous and professional customer service sourcing our merchandise to achieve a positive price value relationship increasing sales at existing store locations expanding our sales  especially in our international division  through additional store locations 
table of contents our ability to achieve these objectives will be dependent on various factors  including those outlined in risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements 
each of these required estimates varies in regard to the level of judgment involved and its potential impact on our reported financial results 
estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and would materially impact our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  critical estimates inherent in these accounting policies are discussed in the following paragraphs 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles  actual results could differ from these estimates  and such differences could be material 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them 
inventory valuation our inventories in north america  spain and sag are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the retail method 
inherent in the retail inventory calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as resulting gross margins 
the methodologies used to value merchandise inventories include the development of the cost to retail ratios  the groupings of homogeneous classes of merchandise  development of shrinkage reserves and the accounting for retail price changes 
the inventories in our united kingdom  belgium  holland  ireland and france stores are accounted for under the lower of cost or market method  with cost determined using the average cost method 
inventory valuation is impacted by the estimation of slow moving goods  shrinkage and markdowns 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of the asset in operations 
when a potential impairment has occurred  an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model using a discount rate we feel is commensurate with the risk inherent in our business 
our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives of assets 
actual results may differ  which could materially impact our impairment assessment 
we recorded no impairment charges during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal goodwill impairment we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant recognition of an impairment loss of goodwill 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of goodwill include a significant  sustained negative trend in our operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand 
table of contents for our products  a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors 
we measure impairment of goodwill utilizing the discounted cash flow method for each of our reporting units 
the estimated discounted cash flows are then compared to our goodwill amounts 
if the balance of the goodwill exceeds the estimated discounted cash flows  the excess of the balance is written off 
future cash flows may not meet projected amounts  which could result in impairment 
we performed these analyses during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  and no impairment charge was required 
intangible asset impairment we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of the useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss for intangible assets 
future adverse changes in market and legal conditions  or poor operating results of underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the intangible asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company has concluded that certain intangible assets  comprised primarily of lease rights  qualify as indefinite life intangible assets 
fair market value of the lease rights was determined through the use of third party valuations 
in addition  we make investments through our international subsidiaries in intangible assets upon the opening and acquisition of many of our store locations in europe 
these other intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  are amortized over the useful lives of the respective leases  not to exceed years 
we evaluate the market value of these assets periodically and record the impairment charge when we believe the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable 
we recorded no material impairment charges during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal income taxes we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions  including the us  individual states and localities and abroad 
our annual consolidated provision for income taxes is determined based on our income  statutory tax rates  and the tax implications of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes 
tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected on the financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences are temporary  reversing over time  such as depreciation expense 
we establish deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of these temporary differences 
our judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income and planning opportunities 
in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  will be realized 
we establish accruals for tax contingencies in our consolidated financial statements based on tax positions that we believe are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the taxing authorities 
we believe these accruals are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience  progress of ongoing tax audits and interpretations of tax law 
if changing facts and circumstances cause us to adjust our accruals  or if we prevail in tax matters for which accruals have been established or we are required to settle matters in excess of established accruals  our income tax expense for a particular period will be affected 
income tax expense also reflects our best estimate and assumptions regarding  among other things  the geographic mix of earnings  interpretation of tax laws of multiple jurisdictions  and resolution of tax audits 
future changes in the geographic mix of earnings or tax laws  or future events regarding the resolution of tax audits could have an impact on our effective income tax rate 
during the year we base our tax rate on an estimate of our expected annual effective income tax rate  and those estimates are updated quarterly 

table of contents stock based compensation during fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation under the provisions of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
stock awards which qualified as fixed grants under apb no 
 such as our time vested stock awards  were accounted for at fair value at date of grant 
the compensation expense was recorded over the related vesting period in a systematic and rational manner consistent with the lapse of restrictions on the shares 
other stock awards  such as long term incentive plan awards  were accounted for at fair value at the date it became probable that performance targets required to receive the award will be achieved 
the compensation expense was recorded over the related vesting period 
determining the number of shares expected to be awarded under the long term incentive plan requires judgment in determining the performance targets to be achieved over the period covered by the plan 
if actual results differ significantly from those estimated  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
stock options were accounted for under the intrinsic value method of apb no 
modifications to option awards were accounted for under the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
the modification to accelerate vesting of outstanding options required an estimate of options which would have expired or been forfeited unexercisable absent the modification to accelerate 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment

results of consolidated operations a summary of our consolidated results of operations is as follows dollars in thousands  except per share data fiscal year net sales increase in comparable store sales gross profit percentage selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales income from continuing operations net income income from continuing operations per diluted share number of stores at the end of the period number of stores excludes claire s nippon and stores operated under license agreements outside of north america net sales in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal  which in turn was million  or higher than fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to comparable store sales increases of and  or approximately million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in addition  for fiscal  new store revenue  net of store closures  approximated million  and increased sales for stores operated outside north america under licensing agreements approximated million 
in addition  new stores opened in our international division produced higher average store sales than the stores we closed in our north american division in fiscal this positive increase in sales in fiscal was offset by the effects of the strengthening us dollar when translating our foreign operations at lower exchange rates of approximately million 
for fiscal  new store revenue  net of closures  approximated million 
table of contents and increased sales for stores operated outside north america under licensing agreements approximated million 
in addition  the effects of the weaker us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates resulted in million of increased sales in fiscal the positive comparable sales experienced in north america in fiscal were primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in the average retail price per transaction  which was the result of an increase of approximately in the average unit retail price 
the positive comparable sales experienced during our past three fiscal years in north america were across various merchandise categories  most notably in the jewelry  cosmetics  and merchandise targeted at a younger claire s customer 
we believe we experienced this trend through successfully meeting our customers demands for current fashion trends in jewelry and superior customer service in our stores 
in addition  best practices in merchandise buying  planning and allocation from claire s have been shared with the icing by claire s and afterthoughts stores  which we believe have contributed significantly to the comparable store sales increases experienced in fiscal we continue to employ strategic initiatives in our international division to address the negative comparable store sales trend noted in the second half of fiscal these initiatives included sharing best practices employed in our north american division for merchandise selection  store operations and attentive customer service 
we believe these efforts contributed to our international division s success in fiscal  providing an increase in comparable store sales of

 jewelry accessories in calculating gross profit and gross profit percentages  we exclude the costs related to our distribution center 
these costs are included instead in selling  general and administrative expenses 
other retail companies may include these costs in cost of sales  so our gross profit percentages may not be comparable to those retailers 
gross profit percentages increased by basis points and basis points during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase during fiscal was primarily attributable to leverage realized from sales increasing faster than rent and rent related costs 
merchandise margins actually decreased slightly on a consolidated basis with north american merchandise margin gains offset by declines in our international division 
merchandise margins during fiscal in our international division decreased primarily due to the strengthening us dollar as compared to the british pound and the euro because most of the goods sourced for sale in our international division are purchased in us dollars  and increased freight costs due to increased fuel costs for air and sea freight to europe from asia 
the primary source of the improvement in fiscal was the ability of our international division to source a significant portion of goods at a lower cost due to those goods being purchased from our vendors in us dollars 
the lower cost was due to the weakness in the us dollar in fiscal as compared to the british pound and the euro and approximated million 
in addition  comparable sales increased at a rate faster than the increase in our occupancy related costs  creating positive leverage on those costs  however  these costs were partially offset by higher markdowns recorded at the end of fiscal in connection with the christmas selling season not meeting expectations 
fiscal also includes million of rent expense recorded to account for the cumulative adjustment to record rent expense incurred during the construction period prior to lease commencement 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in fiscal is primarily attributable to increases in store payroll  stock compensation expense of million for plans implemented in fiscal  a million charge related to estimated future healthcare costs associated with the retirement package of our 
table of contents chairman emeritus  professional fees associated with auditing and legal matters  increased consulting fees for strategic initiatives  credit card processing fees  and initial and ongoing expenses related to opening new stores in spain  belgium and holland 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in leasing expenses for store assets  and certain insurance expenses  and by the effects of the stronger us dollar when translating our foreign operations at lower exchange rates 
the primary source of the increase in fiscal is due to higher compensation paid to store personnel due to average wage increases and additional hours worked in our north american stores and the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates 
additional hours worked in the north american stores were necessary to achieve the positive comparable store sales experienced during these periods 
in addition  during fiscal  increased store  field and corporate bonuses were earned in north america due to the positive comparable store sales and profit results during the period 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by basis points and basis points during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
this improvement was primarily due to comparable store sales increases greater than the overall increases in the underlying expenses 
interest and other income in fiscal increased over fiscal primarily as a result of additional interest income of million arising from higher invested cash balances at higher yields  increased earnings in our claire s nippon joint venture of million  dormancy fees for gift cards of million  and increased license fees of million from increased sales of goods under our merchandising agreements for stores operated outside of north america 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal includes additional tax expense of million related to the repatriation of million in foreign earnings from our foreign subsidiaries  pursuant to the american jobs creation act of see note to consolidated financial statements 
excluding the million charge recorded for fiscal  our effective income tax rate for fiscal has decreased from the previous year primarily due to a change in the overall geographic mix of earnings and other non recurring items 
with respect to the overall geographic mix of earnings  our combined effective income tax rate for our foreign operations is generally lower than our effective income tax rate for us operations 
during fiscal  we recorded net benefits to the provision for income taxes totaling approximately million attributable to concluded state tax examinations that were settled more favorably than anticipated 
included in income taxes for fiscal was a tax benefit of approximately million related to concluded us and foreign tax examinations that were settled more favorably than anticipated 
excluding the million benefit recorded for fiscal  our effective income tax rate for fiscal has decreased from the previous year due to a greater proportion of earnings from our foreign operations 
our effective income tax rate in future periods will depend on several variables  including the geographic mix of earnings and the resolution of tax contingencies for amounts different from our current estimates 
income from continuing operations increased by approximately million and million during each of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these increases were primarily attributable to the increase in comparable store sales and improved merchandise margins achieved during the periods  as well as the leverage attained on our fixed costs 
seasonality and quarterly results sales of each category of merchandise vary from period to period depending on current fashion trends 
we experience traditional retail patterns of peak sales during the christmas  easter and back to school periods 
sales  as a percentage of total sales in each of the four quarters of the fiscal year ended january  were   and  respectively 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for our quarterly results of operations 
impact of inflation inflation impacts several of our operating costs including  but not limited to  cost of goods and supplies  occupancy costs and labor expenses 
we seek to mitigate these effects by passing along inflationary increases in costs through increased sales prices of our products or by increasing sales volumes 

table of contents segment operations we are organized into two business segments north america and international 
following is a discussion of results of operations by business segment 
north america key statistics and results of operations for our north american division are as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year net sales increase in comparable store sales gross profit percentage number of stores at the end of the period number of stores excludes claire s nippon and stores operated under license agreements outside of north america it is our objective to increase sales in north america primarily through generating comparable store sales increases and also by increasing our quantity of our selling square footage 
net sales in north america during fiscal increased by million  or from fiscal  which in turn was million  or higher than fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to comparable store sales increases of million or  and million or  during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in addition  for fiscal  new store revenue  net of store closures  approximated million and increased sales to franchises approximated million 
for fiscal  new store revenue  net of closures  approximated million and increased sales to franchises approximated million 
the positive comparable sales experienced in north america were primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in the average retail price per transaction  which was the result of an increase of approximately in the average unit retail price 
the positive comparable sales experienced in north america during our past three fiscal years were across various merchandise categories  most notably in the jewelry  cosmetics  and merchandise targeted at a younger claire s customer 
we believe we experienced this trend through successfully meeting our customers demands for current fashion trends in jewelry and superior customer service in our stores 
in addition  best practices in merchandise buying  planning and allocation from claire s have been shared with the icing by claire s and afterthoughts stores  which we believe have contributed significantly to the comparable store sales increases experienced during fiscal gross profit percentages improved by basis points and declined by basis points during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase during fiscal was primarily due to leverage on rent and rent related costs as a percentage of sales as the growth of sales outpaced increases in the costs 
an increase in merchandise margins was due to a higher initial markup  less promotional activity during the year and a more disciplined inventory management focus 
the decline during fiscal was due to an increase in freight costs partially offset by decreases in rent and rent related costs as a percentage of sales

interest and other income of million for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal  which increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in fiscal relates primarily to additional interest income of million arising from higher invested cash balances at higher yields  dormancy fees for gift cards of million  and increased earnings in our claire s nippon joint venture of million 
international key statistics and results of operations for our international division are as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year net sales increase decrease in comparable store sales gross profit percentage number of stores at the end of the period number of stores excludes claire s nippon stores and stores operated under license agreements it is our objective to increase sales in the international division primarily through store growth and also through comparable store sales increases 
we also continue to explore adding operations in countries in which we do not currently operate 
net sales in our international division during fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal  which in turn was million  or higher than fiscal the increase in net sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to comparable store sales increases of  or approximately million during the period  new store revenue  net of store closures  of approximately million during the period  and a decline of million resulting from the stronger us dollar when translating our foreign operations at lower exchange rates 
the positive comparable store sales increase in fiscal was primarily driven by an increase of approximately in the average retail price per transaction  which was the result of an increase of approximately in the average unit retail price 
the increase in net sales during fiscal was primarily attributable to new store revenue  net of store closures  of million  the effects of the weak us dollar when translating our foreign operations at higher exchange rates of approximately million  and by comparable store sales increases of  or approximately million during the period 
the comparable store sales increase in fiscal was primarily driven by an increase of approximately in the average number of units sold in each transaction 
due to the strategic initiatives employed within our international division  comparable store sales continued to improve in fiscal and fiscal these initiatives included sharing best practices from our north american operations for merchandise selection  store operations and attentive customer service 
in addition  we are investing in operational systems infrastructure in order to facilitate the greater level of complexity and precision now required to support the anticipated growth and integration of our international division

 jewelry accessories 
table of contents the gross profit percentage declined by basis points in fiscal and improved by basis points in fiscal the decline in gross profit percentage in fiscal is primarily a result of higher merchandise costs and freight costs than in fiscal merchandise costs in fiscal increased due to the strengthening of the us dollar as compared to the british pound and the euro because most of the goods sourced for sale in our international division are purchased in us dollars 
in addition  higher promotional activity was required to reduce excessive inventory levels during the year 
these higher costs were partially offset by decreased rent and rent related costs as a percentage of sales as leverage was realized from the sales gains discussed above 
the primary source of improvement during fiscal was the ability of our international division to source a significant portion of goods at a lower cost due to those goods being purchased from our vendors in us dollars  or approximately million 
the lower cost was available due to the weakness in the us dollar in fiscal as compared to the british pound and the euro

 operating activities investing activities financing activities we have consistently satisfied operating liquidity needs and planned capital expenditure programs through our normal sales 
over the three years ended in fiscal  we generated million of cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations 
we ended fiscal with approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million in cash and cash equivalents from the prior year 
we ended fiscal with no debt outstanding 
the net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the period was primarily due to cash generated from operations and the sale of short term investments  offset by purchases of short term investments  capital expenditures and the payment of dividends 
our major source of cash from operations is store sales  nearly all of which are generated on a cash or credit card basis 
our primary outflow of cash from operations is the purchase of inventory  net of trade accounts payable  operational costs and the payment of current taxes 
our working capital at the end of fiscal was million compared to million at the end of fiscal the increase in working capital reflects higher inventory levels  higher cash and cash equivalents  offset by higher income taxes payable and higher trade accounts payable due to the timing of payments relating primarily to inventory 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  or a million increase 
the change was primarily due to an increase in net income of million  a decrease in inventory purchases of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and an increase in trade accounts payable of million offset by decreases of million in accrued expenses and million in deferred income taxes 
inventory purchases during fiscal declined compared to fiscal due to improved inventory management 
cash provided by investing activities for fiscal was million compared to million used in fiscal  or a million increase 
the cash provided was primarily due to the purchase and sale of short term investments  netting million  compared to net purchases of short term investments in fiscal of million 

table of contents capital expenditures of million were made primarily to remodel existing stores and to open new stores 
we also invested approximately million in intangible assets primarily within our international division representing acquired lease rights on new store locations 
in fiscal  we expect to fund a total of approximately to million of capital expenditures  primarily to remodel existing stores  to open new stores and for modifications and replacements to our information technology systems  and approximately million of acquired lease rights in an effort to continue to expand within our international division and remodel our store base 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  or a million increase 
this was primarily due to an increase of dividends paid by million over the comparable period last year 
we expect to pay approximately million in dividends in fiscal during november  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million 
share repurchases will be made on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prices we consider appropriate  and will be funded from our existing cash 
as of january   no shares had yet been repurchased 
subsequent to january  and through march   we repurchased approximately  shares for million 
liquidity and capital resources our credit facility  a revolving line of credit of up to million  is secured by inventory in the united states 
the credit facility was entered into on march  and expires on march  the borrowings under this facility are limited based on certain calculations of availability  based primarily on the amount of inventory and cash on hand in the united states 
at january   the entire amount of million would have been available for borrowing by us  subject to reduction for million of outstanding letters of credit 
the credit facility is cancelable by us without penalty and borrowings would bear interest at a margin of basis points over the london interbank borrowing rate libor at january  the credit facility also contains other restrictive covenants which limit  among other things  our ability to make dividend distributions if we are in default or if our excess liquidity is less than million during certain periods 
excess liquidity is specifically defined in our credit agreement as the sum of our available credit lines and certain cash and cash equivalent balances 
our excess liquidity has exceeded million since the date of inception of the credit facility 
our non us subsidiaries have bank credit facilities totaling approximately  the facilities are used for working capital requirements  letters of credit and various guarantees 
these credit facilities have been arranged in accordance with customary lending practices in their respective countries of operation 
at january   there were no borrowings under these credit facilities 
management believes that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit lines 
however  if market conditions change and sales were to dramatically decline or we could not control operating costs or other expenses  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced  and we could experience an increase in borrowing costs  or even a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we financed certain leasehold improvements and equipment used in our stores through transactions accounted for as non cancelable operating leases 
as a result  the rental expense for these leasehold improvements and equipment is recorded during the term of the lease contract in our consolidated financial statements  generally over four to seven years 
in the event that any of the real property leases where leasehold improvements or equipment are located that are subject to these non cancelable operating leases are terminated by us or our landlord prior to the scheduled expiration date of the real property lease  we will be required to accrue all future rent payments under these operating leases 

table of contents as of january   our future financial commitments under our arrangements were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than in millions total year years years years operating leases for real estate operating leases for equipment and leasehold improvements letters of credit total the contractual obligations in the table above for our foreign entities have been translated to us dollars at march  exchange rates

recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment 
this statement is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment arrangements 
the statement eliminated the accounting for share based transactions under apb no 
and its related interpretations  instead requiring all share based payments to be accounted for using a fair value method 
the statement can be adopted using the modified prospective application or the modified retrospective application 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on various things  such as when employees exercise stock options 
the company adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective application approach 
as discussed in note  prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  the company accelerated the vesting on substantially all of its unvested stock options and  as a result  there is no material compensation expense to be recorded under sfas no 
r for the company s stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will not have a material effect on compensation expense to be recorded by the company for its time vested stock awards 
under sfas no 
r  the company will record a lower compensation expense relating to unvested shares of the long term incentive stock plan implemented in fiscal than under apb no 
the reduced expense arises from the difference in the company s stock price utilized to account for these shares under apb no 
and the grant date fair value required by sfas no 
r 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r on the new long term incentive plan for fiscal cannot be determined at the present time as such plan has not yet been approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
during october  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
this fsp states that rental costs  incurred during a construction period  associated with ground or building operating leases are not capitalizable and shall be recognized as rental expense 

table of contents the guidance of this fsp is effective with the first reporting period beginning after december  the company does not capitalize such rental costs and this fsp will not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies terminology within sfas no 
and requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act was signed into law 
the jobs creation act includes a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at an approximate percent effective tax rate 
such repatriations must occur in either an enterprise s last tax year that began before the enactment date  or the first tax year that begins during the one year period beginning on the date of enactment 
issued in december  fasb fsp fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of fsp  indicated that the lack of clarification of certain provisions within the jobs creation act and the timing of the enactment necessitated a practical exception to the sfas no
