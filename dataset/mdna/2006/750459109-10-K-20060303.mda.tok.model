risk factors related to our business because of our dependence on certain customers  the loss of  or a substantial decline in sales to  a top customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
during  we derived of our revenues from five customers 
these five customers were nokia  nortel  comverse  philips medical systems and avaya 
during  revenues attributable to nokia and nortel were and  respectively 
we believe that sales to these customers will continue to be a substantial percentage of our revenues 
a financial hardship experienced by  or a substantial decrease in sales to any one of our top customers could materially affect revenues and profitability 
generally  these customers are not the end users of our products 
if any of these customers efforts to market the end products we design and manufacture for them or the end products into which our products are incorporated are unsuccessful in the marketplace our sales and profitability will be significantly reduced 
furthermore  if these customers experience adverse economic conditions in the markets into which they sell our products end markets  we would expect a significant reduction in spending by these customers 
some of the end markets that these customers sell our products into are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change and economic uncertainty 
our exposure to economic cyclicality and any related fluctuation in demand from these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
finally  a financial hardship experienced by one of our top customers could materially affect revenues and profitability 
we are shifting our business from predominately perfect fit solutions to more standards based products  such as atca and com express 
this requires substantial expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our short term earnings and  if this strategy is not successful could have a material adverse effect on our long term revenues  profitability and financial condition 
we are shifting our business from predominately perfect fit solutions to more standards based solutions  such as atca and com express products 
there can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
this strategy requires us to make substantial expenditures for research and development in new technologies that we reflect as a current expense in our financial statements 
we believe that these investments in standards based products and new technologies will allow us to provide a broader set of products and building blocks to take to market and position us to grow on a long term basis 
revenues from some of these investments  such as atca and com express  are not expected to result in any significant revenue opportunities for at least twelve to eighteen months 
accordingly  these expenditures could adversely affect our short term earnings 
in addition  there is no assurance that these new products and technologies will be accepted by our customers and  if accepted  how large the market will be for these products or what the timing will be for any meaningful revenues 
if we are unable to successfully develop and sell standards based products to our customers  our revenues  profitability and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  if we successfully develop standards based products we may incur incremental research and development expenses as we tailor the standards based products for our customers 
furthermore  we are building standards based products to meet industry standards that define the basis of compatibility in operation and communication of a system supported by different vendors 
those standards constantly change and new competing standards emerge 
the development or adaptation of products and technologies require us to commit financial resources  personnel and time significantly in advance of sales 
in order to compete  our decisions with respect to those commitments must accurately anticipate  sometimes two years or more in advance  both future demand and the technologies that will win market acceptance to meet that demand 
our projections of future revenues and earnings are highly subjective and may not reflect future results which could cause volatility in the price of our common stock 
most of our major customers have contracts but these contracts do not commit them to purchase a minimum amount of our products 
these contracts generally require our customers to provide us with forecasts of their anticipated purchases 
however  our experience indicates that customers can change their purchasing patterns quickly in response to market demands and therefore these forecasts may not be relied 
table of contents upon to accurately forecast sales 
from time to time we provide projections to our shareholders and the investment community of our future sales and earnings 
since we do not have long term purchase commitments from our major customers and the customer order cycle is short  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the amount of our sales and related earnings in any given period 
our projections are based on management s best estimate of sales using historical sales data  information from customers and other information deemed relevant 
these projections are highly subjective since sales to our customers can fluctuate substantially based on the demands of their customers and the relevant markets 
in addition and as stated above  we have a high degree of customer concentration 
any significant change in purchases by any one of our largest customers can significantly affect our sales and profitability 
we have recently experienced significant changes in purchases by one of our large customers which adversely impacted the fiscal period in which it occurred 
if our actual sales or earnings are less than the projected amounts  the price of our common stock may be adversely affected and accordingly our shareholders should not place undue reliance on these projections 
not all new product development projects ramp into production  and if ramped into production the volumes derived from such projects may not be as significant as we had originally estimated  which could have a substantial negative impact on our anticipated revenues and profitability 
if a product development project actually ramps into production  the average ramp into production begins about to months after the project launch  although some more complex projects can take up to months or longer 
after that  there is an additional time lag from the start of production ramp to peak revenue 
not all projects ramp into production and even if a project is ramped into production  the volumes derived from such projects may not be as significant as we had originally estimated 
projects are sometimes canceled or delayed  or can perform below original expectations  which can adversely impact anticipated revenues and profitability 
our business depends on the communications networking and commercial systems markets in which demand can be cyclical  and any inability to sell products to these markets could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
we derive our revenues from a number of diverse end markets  some of which are subject to significant cyclical changes in demand 
in  we derived and of our revenues from the communications networking and commercial systems markets  respectively 
we believe that our revenues will continue to be derived primarily from these two markets 
communications networking revenues include  but are not limited to  sales to avaya  comverse  lucent  nokia and nortel 
commercial systems revenues include  but are not limited to  sales to agilent technologies  beckman coulter  diebold  philips medical and seimens ag 
generally  our customers are not the end users of our products 
if our customers experience adverse economic conditions in the markets into which they sell our products end markets  we would expect a significant reduction in spending by our customers 
some of these end markets are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change and economic uncertainty 
our exposure to economic cyclicality and any related fluctuation in customer demand in these end markets could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial condition 
significant reduction in our customers spending  such as what we experienced in and  will result in decreased revenues and earnings 
we continue to execute on our strategy of expanding into new end markets either through new product development projects with our existing customers or through new customer relationships  but no assurance can be given that this strategy will be successful 

table of contents because of our dependence and our contract manufacturers dependence on a few suppliers  or in some cases one supplier  for some of the components we use  as well as our dependence on a few contract manufacturers to supply a majority of our products  a loss of a supplier  a decline in the quality of these components  a shortage of any of these components  or a loss or degradation in performance of a contract manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our business or our financial performance 
we depend on a few suppliers  or in some cases one supplier  for a continuing supply of the components we use in the manufacture of our products and any disruption in supply could adversely impact our financial performance 
for example  we currently rely on intel for the supply of some microprocessors and other components  and we rely on lsi  epson electronic america  broadcom  nec  chen ming  triax and texas instruments as the sole source suppliers for other components such as integrated circuits and mechanical assemblies 
alternative sources of components that are procured from one supplier or a limited number of suppliers would be difficult to locate and or it would require a significant amount of time and resources to establish 
we also rely on contract manufacturers with sole sourcing for certain radisys products 
alternative sources of manufacturing services for the radisys products could require significant time and resources to establish  including transitioning the products to be internally produced 
in addition  any decline in the quality of components supplied by our vendors or products produced by our contracting manufacturing partners could adversely impact our reputation and business performance 
we are shifting the majority of our manufacturing to third party contract manufacturers and our inability to properly transfer our manufacturing or any failed or less than optimal execution on their behalf could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
we have traditionally manufactured a substantial portion of our products 
to lower our costs and provide better value and more competitive products for our customers and to achieve higher levels of global fulfillment  we are shifting a significant amount of our manufacturing to third party contract manufacturers 
at the end of  our contract manufacturing partners were manufacturing approximately of all of our unit volume 
we expect to increase our outsourcing to our contract manufacturers throughout if we do not properly transfer our manufacturing expertise to these third party manufacturers or they fail to adequately perform  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
among other things  inadequate performance from our contract manufacturers could include the production of products that do not meet our high quality standards or unanticipated scheduling delays in production and delivery or cause us to invest in additional internal resources as we lose productivity on other important projects 
additionally  inadequate performance by our contract manufacturers may result in higher than anticipated costs 
we also rely on contract manufacturers as the sole suppliers of certain radisys products 
for example  foxconn produces certain products that we do not produce internally and that no other contract manufacturer produces for us 
alternative sources of supply for the radisys products that our contract manufacturers produce would be difficult to locate and or it would require a significant amount of time and resources to establish an alternative supply line  including transitioning the products to be internally produced 
we currently utilize several contract manufacturers for outsourced board and system production  however  we depend on two primary contract manufacturing partners  foxconn  and celestica  inc unexpected changes in customer demand or our inability to accurately forecast customer demand or unexpected changes in design could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 
we typically sell our products pursuant to purchase orders that customers can cancel or defer delivery on short notice without incurring a significant penalty 
order cancellations or deferrals and or design changes could cause us or our contract manufacturers to hold excess or obsolete inventory that may not be salable to other customers on commercially reasonable terms  and which could require inventory valuation write downs that reduce our gross margin and profitability 
this risk is exacerbated by a current trend 
table of contents from our customers of requiring shorter lead times between placing orders with us and the shipment date 
that typically necessitates in increase in our inventory or inventory of our products at our contract manufacturers locations  raising the likelihood that upon cancellation or deferral  we may be holding greater amounts of inventory and or incurring additional costs 
our contract manufacturers as well as our internal manufacturing department depend on our ability to accurately forecast our customers demand so that they can procure materials and manufacture product to meet such demand 
thereby  we are contractually obligated to reimburse our contract manufacturers for the cost of excess inventory used in the manufacture of our products for which there is no forecasted or alternative use 
unexpected decreases in customer demand or our inability to accurately forecast customer demand could result in increases in our adverse purchase commitment liability and have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 
if we underestimate customer demand  the contract manufacturers may not have adequate inventories  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments to our customers and revenue recognition 
competition in the market for embedded systems is intense  and if we lose our market share  our revenues and profitability could decline 
we compete with a number of companies providing embedded systems  including advantech co  artesyn technologies  continuous computing  hewlett packard  divisions within intel corporation and ibm  kontron ag  mercury computer systems  motorola ecc  performance technologies  sbs technologies and divisions within sun microsystems 
because the embedded systems market is growing  it is attracting new non traditional competitors 
these non traditional competitors include contract manufacturers that provide design services and asian based original design manufacturers 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have a number of significant advantages over us  including a longer operating history  greater name recognition and marketing power  preferred vendor status with our existing and potential customers  and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and customer requirements 
furthermore  existing or potential competitors may establish cooperative relationships with each other or with third parties or adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
as a result of increased competition  we could encounter significant pricing pressures 
these pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for our products 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  cost reductions or otherwise 
in addition  many of the industries we serve  such as the communications industry  are encountering market consolidation  or are likely to encounter consolidation in the near future  which could result in increased pricing pressure and additional competition 
potential acquisitions and partnerships may be more costly or less profitable than anticipated and may adversely affect the price of our company stock 
future acquisitions and partnerships may involve the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity or equity linked securities  issuance of debt and amortization of intangible assets with determinable lives 
we may also be required to charge against earnings upon consummation of the acquisition the value of an acquired business technology that does not meet the accounting definition of completed technology 
moreover  to the extent that any proposed acquisition or strategic investment is not favorably received by shareholders  analysts and others in the investment community  the price of our 
table of contents common stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and performance below expectations by an acquired business 
in the event that an acquisition or a partnership does occur and we are unable to successfully integrate operations  technologies  products or personnel that we acquire  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may expend additional resources without receiving benefit from strategic alliances with third parties 
our international operations expose us to additional political  economic and regulatory risks not faced by businesses that operate only in the united states 
in  as measured by delivery destination  we derived of our revenues from canada and mexico  of our revenues from emea and from asia pacific 
in addition  during we opened a development center in shanghai  china and began to utilize a contract manufacturer in shenzhen  china 
in  approximately of our total revenues were associated with products produced at our china contract manufacturer 
in we began migrating products to a celestica facility in mexico 
so far production at this facility does not make up a meaningful portion of our total revenues 
as a result of all these activities  we are subject to worldwide economic and market condition risks generally associated with global trade  such as fluctuating exchange rates  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest  wars and other acts of terrorism and changes in other economic conditions 
these risks  among others  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
additionally  some of our sales to overseas customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the united states department of commerce 
protectionist trade legislation in either the united states of america or other countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance laws  trade restrictions resulting from war or terrorism  or other trade policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to manufacture in international markets 
furthermore  revenues from outside the united states of america are subject to inherent risks  including the general economic and political conditions in each country 
these risks  among others  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
if we are unable to generate sufficient income in the future  we may not be able to fully utilize our net deferred tax assets or support our current levels of goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet 
we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets of million as of december  we may not generate sufficient taxable income due to earning lower than forecasted net income or incurring charges associated with unusual events  such as restructurings and acquisitions 
accordingly  we may record a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of future taxable income are not achieved 
on the other hand  if we generate taxable income in excess of our expectations  the valuation allowance may be reduced accordingly 
we also cannot provide absolute assurance that future income will support the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december   and therefore  we may incur an impairment charge in the future 

table of contents our products for embedded solutions are based on industry standards  which are continually evolving  and any failure to conform to these standards or lack of success of these standards could have a substantial negative impact on our revenues and profitability 
we develop and supply a mix of perfect fit and standards based products 
standards based products for embedded computing applications are often based on industry standards  which are continually evolving 
our future success in these products will depend  in part  upon our capacity to invest in  and successfully develop and introduce new products based on emerging industry standards 
our inability to invest in or conform to these standards could render parts of our product portfolio uncompetitive  unmarketable or obsolete 
as new standards are developed for our addressable markets standards  we may be unable to successfully invest in  design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or achieve substantial market acceptance 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose a valuable competitive advantage or be forced to incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
we are a technology dependent company  and our success depends on developing and protecting our intellectual property 
we rely on patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property 
at the same time  our products are complex  and are often not patentable in their entirety 
we also license intellectual property from third parties and rely on those parties to maintain and protect their technology 
we cannot be certain that our actions will protect proprietary rights 
if we are unable to adequately protect our technology  or if we are unable to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for protected technology from third parties  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  some of our products are now designed  manufactured and sold outside of the united states of america 
despite our precautions to protect our intellectual property  this international exposure may reduce or limit protection of our intellectual property which is more prone to design piracy 
our period to period revenues  operating results and earnings per share fluctuate significantly  which may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
the price of our common stock may be subject to wide  rapid fluctuations 
our period to period revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in the future  and any such fluctuations may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
fluctuations in the stock price may also be due to other factors  such as changes in analysts estimates regarding earnings  or may be due to factors relating to the commercial systems and communication networking markets in general 
shareholders should be willing to incur the risk of such fluctuations 
we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel  and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business 
due to the specialized nature of our business  our future performance is highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales and management personnel for our operations 
competition for personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
our failure to compete for these personnel could seriously harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if incentive programs we offer are not considered desirable by current and prospective employees  we could have difficulty retaining or recruiting qualified personnel 
if we are unable to recruit and retain key employees  our product development  and marketing and sales could be harmed 
our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting do not guarantee the absence of error or fraud 
disclosure controls are procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act  such as this annual report  is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the us securities and exchange commission s rules and 
table of contents forms 
disclosure controls are also designed to ensure that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including the ceo and cfo  as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
internal control over financial reporting internal controls are procedures which are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of radisys  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of radisys are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of radisys  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of radisys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
to the extent that components of our internal controls are included in our disclosure controls  they are included in the scope of our quarterly controls evaluation 
our management  including the ceo and cfo  do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
oregon corporate law  our articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us even if the change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our shareholders 
these provisions authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without prior shareholder approval to increase the number of outstanding shares and deter or prevent a takeover attempt  establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of shareholders to elect director candidates  and limit the ability of shareholders to take action by written consent  thereby effectively requiring all common shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our common shareholders 
in addition  if our common stock is acquired in specified transactions deemed to constitute control share acquisitions  provisions of oregon law condition the voting rights that would otherwise be associated 
table of contents with those common shares upon approval by our shareholders excluding  among other things  the acquirer in any such transaction 
provisions of oregon law also restrict  subject to specified exceptions  the ability of a person owning or more of our common stock to enter into any business combination transaction with us 
the foregoing provisions of oregon law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in recent years  various state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection  treatment  recycling and disposal of certain materials used in the manufacturing of electrical and electronic components have been enacted 
in support of these laws and regulations  we will incur significant additional expenditures and we may incur additional capital expenditures and asset impairments to ensure that our products and our vendor s products are in compliance with these regulations  and we may also incur significant penalties in connection with any violations of these laws 
additionally  failure to comply with these regulations could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  our financial condition or operating results may be negatively impacted 
the most significant pieces of legislation relate to two european union eu directives aimed at wastes from electrical and electronic equipment weee and the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances rohs 
specifically  the rohs directive prohibits the use of certain types of materials  such as lead  in the manufacturing of electronic products 
as of july  products sold within the eu  a market in which we sell a significant amount of our products  must be rohs compliant 
failure to comply with such legislation could result in our customers refusing to purchase our products and subject us to significant monetary penalties in connection with a violation  both of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
other risk factors related to our business other risk factors include  but are not limited to  changes in the mix of products sold  regulatory and tax legislation  changes in effective tax rates  inventory risks due to changes in market demand or our business strategies  potential litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business  credit risk of customers and other risk factors 
additionally  proposed changes to accounting rules could materially affect what we report under generally accepted accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results

we believe standards based solutions provide our customers a number of fundamental benefits 
first  by using ready made platform solutions rather than ground start custom designs  our customers can achieve significantly shorter product intervals and faster time to market 
second  we believe our customers can achieve a lower total cost by using solutions that are leveraged across multiple applications rather than a single use proprietary solution 
by offering ready made solutions  we believe we have the opportunity to address a wider range of new market opportunities with the potential for faster time to revenue than with 
table of contents ground start  custom designs 
we believe this ability to reuse designs makes our business and investment model more scalable 
finally  we believe a more standards based product model will allow us to provide more integrated higher value solutions to our customers than we have typically delivered under a custom design model 
these higher value solutions drive higher price points and therefore more total revenue opportunities for our products 
in  we announced our plan for the promentum tm family of atca products and in we recorded our first revenue associated with these products 
the promentum tm family of products includes universal carrier cards  switch and control modules  disk storage modules  compute modules  and a slot shelf or chassis 
the promentum tm sys integrates these individual products into a blade server platform system 
we believe the promentum tm sys system will provide customers a highly reliable managed platform on which to build their new voice and data offerings 
during the second quarter of  we announced the promentum tm atca  a packet processing module that allows the highest bandwidth available in a single atca slot 
this product is the latest addition to our family of atca compliant products featuring dual intel ixpxx network processors and is designed to address gbps wirespeed packet processing in network applications that demand high bandwidth throughput such as security gateways  ggsn s  broadband remote access servers  edge routers and session controllers 
we have significant experience in the design  delivery and deployment of carrier grade  modular platforms 
we believe the atca standard increases our opportunity to implement reusable platforms  enabling the deployment of more flexible solutions based on cost effective commercial technologies 
we believe our core atca solutions will be applicable across a wide range of customers and applications and are potentially applicable in all of our defined markets 
these integrated hardware and software platforms make extensive use of common system architectural and component designs  using carrier grade operating systems and middleware  and will reduce development time and costs  which enhances application portability 
in addition to our new atca offerings  we announced our new procelerant tm series of modular computing solutions for customers in our commercial systems markets for medical  transaction terminals and test and measurement applications 
during the second quarter of  we closed our first procelerant tm application 
during the third quarter of  we announced three new procelerant tm motherboards  including the industry s first to support the new microbtx form factor 
we believe these new modular products will represent a family of high density  flexible solutions that will enable commercial systems customers to achieve more rapid time to market with cost effective designs 
total revenue was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
backlog was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
backlog includes all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within months 
the general trend within our addressable markets is for shorter lead times and supplier managed inventory  which will generally decrease backlog over time as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in revenues from to was primarily attributable to sales volume increases and new product sales in our end markets 
the increase in revenues during compared to was due to an increase in revenues in the communications networking market of million offset by a million decrease in revenues from the commercial systems market 
the increase in revenues in compared to was due to an increase in revenues in the communication networking and commercial systems markets of million and million  respectively 
revenues in the communications networking market increased from to primarily due to strong demand within the wireless submarket as we continued to design and supply more content within our customers and g deployments 
revenues in the commercial systems market decreased in the compared to  primarily due to declines in our transaction terminal and industrial automation business  partially offset by increases within our medical and test and measurement market 
the decreases in the transaction terminal revenues was primarily due to design wins nearing the end of their life cycle 
the increase in revenues from the medical market is attributable to design wins that have ramped into production during revenue in the commercial systems market increased approximately million from levels to levels due to new product 
table of contents development projects ramping into production volumes and the economic recovery early in which buoyed demand in cyclical sub markets 
from a geographic perspective  from to the percentage of non us revenues by delivery destination increased as a percentage of total revenues 
this was primarily due to existing multinational customers requesting the delivery of products directly into the asia pacific region and increased revenues attributable to our emea region associated with our wireless infrastructure products 
for the year ended december  revenues from north america declined by million compared to the same periods in in  the declines in our north american revenues was also due to a decrease in the transaction terminal and industrial automation business 
we expect our non us revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues were  and for  and  respectively 
we experienced lower gross margin as a percentage of total revenues primarily because more of our revenues shifted to higher volume products which have lower margins due to volume based pricing 
the decrease in the gross margin as a percentage of revenues was also associated with an increase in the write downs of inventory valuation for estimated excess  obsolete or unmarketable inventories  an increase in the adverse purchase commitment liabilities associated with our outsourced manufacturing operations and higher silicon prices due to industry shortages 
we also incurred some redundant manufacturing costs as we moved forward with outsourcing our internal manufacturing to our contract manufacturing partners celestica and foxconn 
finally  we incurred additional manufacturing related costs in due to making our products rohs compliant and incurring additional warranty related costs 
based on current forecasted revenue mix and higher silicon prices  we currently anticipate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be in the high s for the next few quarters 
this margin range excludes any impact from stock based compensation expense that would result from the implementation of a new accounting standard that requires the recognition of stock based compensation expense associated with employee stock options  which became effective january  income from continuing operations was million in  million in and million in income per share from continuing operations was and  basic and diluted  respectively  for compared to and  basic and diluted  respectively  in income per share from continuing operations was and  basic and diluted  respectively  in net income was million  million and million in  and respectively 
net income per share was and  basic and diluted  respectively  in compared to and  basic and diluted  respectively  in net income per share was  basic and diluted  in during the first quarter of  we completed the sale of our savvi business which allowed us to focus on our core embedded systems business within our two primary markets 
the million loss from discontinued operations recorded in the first quarter of includes a million loss on the sale of the savvi business as well as thousand of net losses incurred by the business unit during the quarter 
income from continuing operations has increased from to  despite the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues primarily due to an increase in interest income and a decline in interest expense 
our interest income continues to increase as we continue to generate cash from operations and realize the benefit of rising interest rates 
we have decreased our interest expense by repurchasing a significant amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes through various repurchases throughout to we have increased our investment in research and development from to and  as previously discussed  we currently plan to continue to increase our spending on development of standards based solutions 
our income from continuing operations from to has been negatively impacted by restructuring charges primarily resulting from our transition to outsourced manufacturing 
we have also continued to invest in infrastructure in emerging markets such as china through the hiring of engineers for our shanghai r d center 
a significant portion of our products are currently assembled by  our china based manufacturing partner  and we expect to increase this outsourcing activity in we have hired employees in china to support the outsourcing initiative  and we have also added 
table of contents sales and marketing support personnel in china to focus on selling product into this region 
in addition we have entered into a relationship with a mexico based manufacturing partner and expect this outsourcing activity to increase in as well 
from through  we initiated multiple restructurings of our operations 
these restructurings primarily included workforce reductions 
these workforce reductions were a result of the increase in outsourced manufacturing and a result of aligning our workforce to deliver more integrated advanced embedded platforms and solutions or standards based solutions 
in november  we completed a private offering of convertible senior notes due november  to qualified institutional buyers  resulting in net proceeds of million 
we plan to use the proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes including working capital  potential acquisitions  partnership opportunities and targeted repayment of existing debt obligations 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes for million 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes for million 
on april  the board of directors approved the repurchase of the remaining principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes 
in  we repurchased million principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes for million 
in addition  on october  the board of directors authorized an increase in the repurchase of our outstanding shares of common stock from a previously approved million to million 
we currently intend to purchase the remaining balance of the convertible subordinated notes and outstanding common stock on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market conditions 
in  we began granting restricted stock to our employees 
as a result  in  we incurred thousand of stock based compensation expense associated with the vesting of restricted stock 
during  we incurred thousand of stock based compensation expense associated with shares to be issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan espp 
we incurred stock based compensation expense because the original number of espp shares approved by the shareholders was insufficient to meet employee demand for an espp offering which was consummated in february of and ended in august of we subsequently received shareholder approval for additional espp shares in may the stock based compensation expense associated with our equity instruments issued in  and was calculated using the intrinsic value method 
as of january   we are required to account for stock based compensation based on the fair value method  which replaces the intrinsic value method 
in note to the consolidated financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures of net income loss and net income loss per common share as if the fair value method had been applied in measuring stock compensation expense 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition after december  prior periods will not be restated 
we estimate income from operations will be reduced by stock based compensation expense of approximately million to million in cash and cash equivalents and investments amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily due to cash provided from operating activities 
we generated net cash from operations in excess of net income during we believe that cash flows from operations  available cash and investment balances  and short term borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs for the short term and long term 
in the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  we intend to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation allowance we record the write downs of inventory valuation for estimated excess  obsolete or unmarketable inventories e o as the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
factors influencing the write downs include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management additional write downs of the inventory valuation may be required 
our estimate for the write down is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations to us 
we provide long life support to our customers and therefore we have significant levels of customer specific inventory 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current inventory valuation allowance may be inadequate 
additionally  we may incur additional expenses associated with any non cancelable purchase obligations to our suppliers if they provide customer specific components 
during the fourth quarter of  we revised our inventory valuation allowance calculation to more accurately reflect our true exposure to losses associated with e o inventories moving forward 
we previously estimated our required inventory valuation allowance based on a forward projection of excess material beyond months demand 
this resulted in an allowance estimate that was higher than the actual e o losses for products where our demand and orders are more sporadic 
our revised process combines the historical view of demand over the prior six months with a prospective view of demand over months 
we tested the revised method against prior periods and found it to be a more accurate predictor of excess inventory 
this change resulted in a reduction to the write downs for inventory valuation of approximately thousand in the fourth quarter of adverse purchase commitments we are contractually obligated to reimburse our contract manufacturers for the cost of excess inventory used in the manufacture of our products  for which there is no alternative use 
excess inventory is defined as raw materials or assemblies components used in the manufacture of our products for which the contract manufacturers on hand and on order quantities are in excess of the requirements derived from our current product forecast of customer demand 
we are liable for excess inventory only to the extent that the contract manufacturer procures components to fulfill the manufacturing requirements as set forth in our current product forecast or agreed upon lead times and minimum order quantities 
unexpected decreases in customer demand or our inability to accurately forecast customer demand could result in increases in our adverse purchase commitment liability and have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents profitability 
factors influencing the adverse purchase commitments liability include changes in demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  and physical deterioration 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management we may incur additional expenses due to increases in our adverse purchase commitment liabilities 
our estimate for the adverse purchase commitments liabilities is based on the assumption that our customers comply with their current contractual obligations to us 
if our customers experience a financial hardship or if we experience unplanned cancellations of customer contracts  the current adverse purchase commitments liabilities may be inadequate 
as we continue to execute our strategy of increasing the level of outsourced manufacturing the liability for adverse purchase commitments will become more significant 
estimates for adverse purchase commitments are derived from reports received on a quarterly basis from our contract manufacturers 
increases to this liability are charged to cost of goods sold 
when and if we take possession of inventory reserved for in this liability  the liability is transferred from other liabilities to our inventory valuation allowance 
this liability  referred to as adverse purchase commitments  is provided for in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
adverse purchase commitments amounted to thousand and thousand at december  and december   respectively 
accrued warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our standard product warranty terms generally include post sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time  which is generally months after shipment 
the workmanship of our products produced by contract manufacturers is covered under warranties provided by the contract manufacturer for a specified period of time ranging from to months 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our estimated warranty obligation is based upon ongoing product failure rates  internal repair costs  contract manufacturing repair charges for repairs not covered by the contract manufacturer s warranty  average cost per call and current period product shipments 
if actual product failure rates  repair rates  service delivery costs  or post sales support costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
additionally  we accrue warranty costs for specific customer product repairs that are in excess of our warranty obligation calculation described above 
long lived assets our long lived assets include indefinite lived intangible assets or goodwill  definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment 
the net balance of goodwill  definite lived intangible assets and property and equipment at december  amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with prior acquisitions 
goodwill will be written down or written off when impaired 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances conditions indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september  and concluded that as of september   there was no goodwill impairment 
our annual goodwill impairment analysis consists of comparing our book value to our market capitalization 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period  a goodwill impairment test will be performed 
our book value per share was at september  compared to the closing price of radisys shares as quoted on nasdaq or the trading price on september  of 
management concluded there was no indication of material changes requiring an updated goodwill impairment analysis as of december  
table of contents intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  primarily consist of acquired patents  completed technology  technology licenses and trade names 
intangible assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  primarily consists of office equipment and software  manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements  a building and other physical assets owned by radisys 
property and equipment are being depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we assess impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment whenever changes in circumstances conditions indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
conditions that would trigger a long lived asset impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if we determine that a long lived asset impairment assessment is required  we must determine the fair value of the asset  which is determined based on the associated net present value of estimated future cash flows 
we would estimate future cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to our business operations 
impairments would be recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value exceeds this calculated fair value of the long lived assets 
historically  we have recognized impairments of long lived assets as follows as a result of the sale of the savvi business in  we recorded million in write offs of goodwill 
this impairment charge is included in the loss from discontinued operations related to the savvi business in during  we reviewed property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets for impairment due to several events  including the sale of the savvi business  the restructuring event in the first quarter  and the sale of our facility in des moines iowa 
as a result of the sale of the savvi business  we recorded an impairment of our intangible assets of million 
this impairment charge is included in the loss from discontinued operations related to the savvi business in we disposed of million of net book value associated with the building and other office equipment as a result of the sale of the des moines  iowa facility 
the write off of the net book value associated with building and office equipment is included in loss on building sale in also in  we performed a fixed asset physical inventory count  during which we evaluated whether the carrying value of the property and equipment would be recoverable 
we recorded write offs of thousand as a result of the fixed asset physical inventory 
considerable management judgment is required in determining if and when an event would trigger an impairment assessment of our long lived assets and once such a determination has been made  considerable management judgment is required to determine the fair market value of the long lived asset 
if the trading price or the average trading price of our common stock is below the book value per share for a sustained period or if and when an event has triggered an impairment analysis of our long lived assets  we may incur substantial impairment losses due to the write down or the write off of our long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in its future tax returns 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required 
the net deferred tax assets amounted to million as of december  as of december  we estimate utilization of the net deferred tax assets will require that we generate million in taxable income prior to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards which will occur between and 
table of contents we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of future taxable income are not achieved 
if we were to record a valuation allowance  the allowance could include the entire balance of net deferred tax assets as any significant departures from expected future taxable income could suggest uncertainty in our business and therefore we may determine that there is no reasonable basis to calculate a partial valuation allowance 
on the other hand  if we generate taxable income in excess of our future expectations  the valuation allowance may be reduced accordingly 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have a relatively small set of multinational customers that typically make up the majority of our accounts receivable balance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade receivables balances are not overstated 
we record reserves for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
if circumstances related to customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted 
at december   of our accounts receivable was due from our four largest customers 
if one of these large customers or a number of our smaller customers files for bankruptcy or otherwise is unable to pay us the amounts due the current allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate 
during the years ended december  and there were no significant account balances reserved for and the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by thousand as a result of the write off of previously specifically identified account balances 
we maintain a non specific bad debt reserve for all customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events and historical experience 
typically  this non specific bad debt reserve amounts to at least of quarterly revenues 
accrued restructuring and other charges for the years ended december   and expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when probable and estimable 
because we have a history of paying severance benefits  the cost of severance benefits associated with a restructuring charge is recorded when such costs are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for leased facilities that were vacated and subleased  an amount equal to the total future lease obligations from the date of vacating the premises through the expiration of the lease  net of any future sublease income  was recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in restructuring actions  which require us to make significant estimates in several areas including realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete  expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations at the amounts we have estimated  and other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
for a description of our restructuring actions  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in the results of operations section 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by the following revenue recognition criteria an agreement with the customer  fixed pricing  delivery or transfer of title and customer acceptance  if applicable  and that the collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services  and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions under which we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  infrequently we enter into agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
non standard terms and conditions can include  but are not limited to  customer acceptance criteria or other 
table of contents post delivery obligations 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
the components of total revenues were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  hardware software royalties and licenses software maintenance engineering and other services other total revenues hardware under our standard terms and conditions of sale  we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is shipped to the customer and revenue is recognized accordingly  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns for rotation rights according to agreements with our distributors 
the amount of revenues derived from these distributors as a percentage of total revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
software royalties and licenses revenue from customers for prepaid  non refundable software royalties is recorded when the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue for non prepaid royalties is recognized at the time the underlying product is shipped by the customer paying the royalty 
we recognize software license revenue at the time of shipment or upon delivery of the software master provided when the revenue recognition criteria have been met and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to all delivered and undelivered elements of the arrangement 
software maintenance software maintenance services are recognized as earned on the straight line basis over the terms of the contracts 
engineering and other services engineering services revenue is recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 
other services revenues include hardware repair services and custom software implementation projects 
hardware repair services revenues are recognized when the services are complete 
software implementation revenues are recognized upon completion of certain contractual milestones and customer acceptance of the services rendered 
stock based compensation equity instruments are granted to employees  directors and consultants in certain instances  as defined in the respective plan agreements 
in  we issued equity instruments in the form of stock options  restricted stock and stock issued to employees as a result of the employee stock purchase plan espp 
in and we issued equity instruments in the form of stock options and stock issued to employees as a result of the espp  only 
we currently account for the stock based compensation expense associated with our equity instruments using the intrinsic value method 
we provide pro forma disclosures of net income loss and net income loss per common share as if the fair value method had been applied in 
table of contents measuring compensation expense 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its final determination on the issue of stock based compensation  requiring companies to account for stock based compensation based on the fair value method  which replaces the intrinsic value method 
for periods prior to the effective date of this change  the pro forma disclosures mentioned previously were an alternative to recognition in the financial statements 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition after december  as the effective date of this change for us is january  we currently use the black scholes model to measure our stock based compensation expense for the pro forma disclosures 
we will continue to use the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of equity instruments which will then be amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we will apply the modified prospective method  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and espp shares upon the effective date of this change or january  prior periods will not be restated 
to determine the fair value of our stock based compensation plans  we currently take into consideration the following exercise price of the option or share expected life of the option or share price of our common stock on the date of grant expected volatility of our common stock over the expected life of the option or share risk free interest rate during the expected term of the option the calculation includes several assumptions that require management s judgment 
the expected life of the option or share is determined based on assumptions about patterns of employee exercises  and represents a probability weighted average time period from grant until exercise of stock options  subject to information available at time of grant 
determining expected volatility generally begins with calculating historical volatility for a similar long term period and then considering the ways in which the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past 
the pro forma disclosure for  and included in note to the consolidated financial statements are not likely to be representative of the effects on reported net income loss and net income loss per share for future years primarily due to the following factors we incurred incremental expense associated with options exchanged as a result of the stock option exchange program see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the value of this exchange was million and amortized on a straight line basis beginning on the date of exchange in august to the date of the acceleration see below  at which time the remaining entire expense was recognized  net of related tax effects 
in  the compensation and development committee of the board of directors approved an acceleration the acceleration of vesting of those non director employee stock options with an option price greater than  which was greater than the fair market value of the shares on that date 
approximately million options with varying remaining vesting schedules were subject to the acceleration and became immediately exercisable 
historically we have not accelerated the vesting of employee stock options 
as a result of the acceleration  we reduced the stock based compensation expense that it will include in net income after january  included in the pro forma stock based compensation expense for is million associated with the acceleration  net of related tax effects 
additional awards are made every year and beginning in  we changed our equity instrument compensation structure such that we are issuing more restricted shares and fewer stock options 

table of contents we estimate income from operations will be reduced by stock based compensation expense of approximately million to million in however  the actual stock based compensation expense estimated for could materially differ from this estimate 
our assessment  which includes an estimate of the timing and number of future options grants and share issuances  is based on the black scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price as well as management s assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  as previously mentioned 
as such  our actual stock option expense may differ materially from this estimate 
additionally  sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after its adoption

revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase in revenue during compared to was due to an increase in revenues in the communications networking market of million offset by a million decrease in revenues from the commercial systems market 
revenues in the communications networking market increased in compared to due to strong demand within the wireless market as our product content continues to expand with and g deployments 
revenues were also higher due to deployments of new products by one of our major customers 

table of contents revenues in the commercial systems market decreased in the compared to  primarily due to declines in our transaction terminal and industrial automation business  partially offset by increases within our medical and test and measurement market 
the decrease in revenues attributable to the transaction terminal market was primarily due to design wins nearing the end of their life cycle 
the increase in revenues from the medical market was attributable to design wins that have ramped into production during given the dynamics of these markets  we may experience general fluctuations in the percentage of revenue attributable to each market and  as a result  the quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our markets often are not indicative of overall economic trends affecting the long term performance of our markets 
we currently expect that each of our markets will continue to represent a significant portion of total revenues 
from a geographic perspective  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the overall increase in revenues was split between customers located in the emea and asia pacific regions 
for the year ended december  compared to the same period in revenues as measured by destination in the emea region increased by million while asia pacific revenues increased by million 
this increase to the asia pacific region was due to shipments of products to existing multinational customers receiving products directly into the asia pacific region 
for the year ended december  revenues from north america declined by million compared to the same periods in the decline in this region was a result of declines in our transaction terminal and industrial automation business as well as a shift of sales for our multinational customers requesting delivery of products directly into the asia pacific region 
we currently expect continued fluctuations in the percentage of revenue from each geographic region 
additionally  we expect non us revenues to remain a significant portion of our revenues 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenues for was compared to for approximately half of the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was attributable to product mix as more of our revenue came from higher volume products with volume based pricing 
the remainder of the decrease was associated with our write down of inventory valuation for excess and obsolete e o inventory  an increase in the adverse purchase commitment liabilities associated with our outsourced manufacturing operations and higher silicon prices due to industry shortages 
we also continued to incur some redundant manufacturing costs as we moved forward with outsourcing our internal manufacturing to our partners celestica and foxconn 
finally  we incurred additional manufacturing related costs in due to making our products rohs compliant and incurring additional warranty related costs 
based on current forecasted revenue mix and higher silicon prices  we currently anticipate that gross margin as a percentage of revenues will be in the high s for the next few quarters 
this margin range excludes any impact from stock based compensation expense that will result from the implementation of the new accounting standard that requires the recognition of stock based compensation expense associated with employee stock options and espp shares  effective january  research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  bonuses and benefits for product development staff  and cost of design and development supplies and equipment  net of reimbursements for non recurring engineering services 
research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in we plan on additional increases for the next couple of quarters before leveling off in the second half of our investment in the development of standards based products  such as atca  increased our research and development expense for compared during  we also continued to increase headcount at our shanghai development center and added other expenses in connection with the development of the infrastructure to support this location 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation linked to profitability

stock based compensation expense 
in  thousand shares of restricted stock were granted 
we incurred thousand of stock based compensation related to restricted stock for the year ended december  we did not incur any stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock for the year ended december  in  we incurred thousand of stock based compensation expense associated with shares issued pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan espp 
we incurred stock based compensation expense because the original number of espp shares approved by the shareholders was insufficient to meet employee demand for an espp offering which was consummated in february and ended in august we subsequently received shareholder approval for additional espp shares in may the shares issued in the february espp offering in excess of the original number of espp shares approved at the beginning of the offering the shortfall triggered recognition of stock based compensation expense under the intrinsic value method 
the shortfall amounted to thousand and thousand shares in may and august  respectively 
the expense per share was calculated as the difference between of the closing price of radisys shares as quoted on nasdaq on the date that additional espp shares were approved may and the february espp offering purchase price 
accordingly  the expense per share was calculated as the difference between and 
the shortfall of shares was dependent on the amount of contributions from participants enrolled in the february espp offering we recognized stock based compensation expense in reported net income related to restricted stock grants and the espp shortfall as follows in thousands for the years ended december  cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative intangible assets amortization 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  patents and other identifiable intangible assets 
intangible assets amortization expense was million and million in and  respectively 
intangible assets amortization decreased due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the first and second quarters of we perform reviews for impairment of the purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
restructuring and other charges 
we evaluate the adequacy of the accrued restructuring and other charges on a quarterly basis 
as a result  we record certain reclassifications and reversals to the accrued restructuring and other charges based on the results of the evaluation 
the total accrued restructuring and other charges for each restructuring event are not affected by reclassifications 
reversals are recorded in the period in which we determine that expected restructuring and other obligations are less than the amounts accrued 
tables summarizing the activity in the accrued liability for each restructuring event are 
table of contents contained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during and  we recorded restructuring and other charges and reversals as described below 
second quarter restructuring in june  we initiated a restructuring plan that included the elimination of positions primarily within our manufacturing operations as a result of the continued outsourcing of production to our primary manufacturing partners  celestica and foxconn 
in  we incurred severance and other employee related separation costs of approximately million as a result of this restructuring event 
we expect the workforce reduction to be substantially completed by june  fourth quarter restructuring in october  we announced plans to eliminate approximately to positions as a result of the increase in outsourced manufacturing as well as to continue our shift of skills required to develop  market  sell  and support more advanced embedded platforms and solutions 
in and  we incurred severance and other employee related separation costs and other charges of thousand and million  respectively  as a result of this restructuring event 
the balance in accrued restructuring liability related to this charge was zero at december  third quarter restructuring in august  we announced plans to close our birmingham uk office and eliminate approximately engineering and marketing positions 
in  we completed integrating the work done by these employees into other radisys locations 
in conjunction with this elimination of positions  r d spending was re directed to align our strategy to deliver more integrated standards based solutions

the reversals were primarily associated with employees who left radisys prior to receiving a severance payment and employees who were retained to fill new positions at radisys 
in  we recorded reversals amounting to million relating primarily to a buy out of the remaining lease obligations on the houston facility vacated as a result of previous restructuring events and various amounts originally accrued for certain non cancelable leases for facilities vacated as a result of previous restructuring events 
we entered into subleasing arrangements for a portion of these facilities and as a result we reduced the restructuring accruals 
loss on the repurchase of convertible notes

other expense  net 
other expense  net  primarily includes foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other expense  net  was thousand in compared to thousand in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net loss of thousand in compared to a net loss of thousand in the net exchange rate loss incurred for the year ended december  was primarily caused by the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen throughout income tax provision 
we recorded a tax provision of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the year ended was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the tax provision as well as the effective tax rate in versus is primarily due to a projected increase in future utilization of deferred tax assets causing the reversal of a portion of the related valuation allowance and taxes on foreign income that differs from us tax rate 
we currently estimate that our effective tax rate for will be approximately 
the estimated effective tax rate is based on current tax law and current projections of income  and assumes that we continue to receive the tax benefits associated with certain income associated with foreign jurisdictions 
the tax rate may be affected by potential acquisitions  restructuring events or divestitures  the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed  and the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
additionally  the estimated effective rate for excludes any impact from stock based compensation expense that will result from the implementation of the new accounting standard that requires the recognition of stock based compensation expense associated with employee stock options and espp shares  effective january  on october   the president of the united states of america signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
one of the key provisions of the act includes a repeal of the extraterritorial income exclusion 
in its place  the act provides a relief provision for domestic manufacturers by providing a new domestic manufacturing deduction 
the act also includes a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings and other international tax reforms designed to improve the global competitiveness of us multinationals 
we have completed our evaluation of the impact of the act and have concluded not to repatriate any foreign earnings pursuant to the provisions of the act and have determined that due to the reduction of our domestic manufacturing operations  the impact of domestic manufacturing deduction was minimal 
on october  the working families tax relief act of was enacted to extend several tax credits  including the research and development tax credit 
under the new law the research and development tax credit was retroactively reinstated to june  and is available through december  we have recorded a federal research and development credit of approximately thousand for the year ended 
table of contents at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
valuation allowances of million and million  as of december  and  respectively  have been provided for deferred income tax assets related primarily to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may not be realized 
the decrease in valuation allowance of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a projected increase in future utilization of general business tax credits and certain net operating loss carryforwards 
over the last three years we have generated significant cumulative book income 
as of december  we estimate utilization of the net deferred tax assets will require that we generate million in taxable income prior to the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards which will occur between and we cannot provide absolute assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  and accordingly  we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if our expectations of future taxable income change or are not achieved 
if we were to record a valuation allowance  the allowance could include the entire balance of net deferred tax assets as any significant departures from expected future taxable income could suggest uncertainty in our business and therefore we may determine that there is no reasonable basis to calculate a partial valuation allowance 
any tax benefit subsequently recognized from the acquired net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards of microware would be allocated to goodwill

the revised process combines the historical view of demand over the prior six months with a prospective view of demand over months 
we tested the revised method against prior periods and found it to be a better indicator of excess inventory 
additionally  the inventory valuation allowance requirements decreased due to increasing demand and consumption for some of our older products 
warranty expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from in to in due to a few unique  specifically identified warranty related issues that made up a large portion of the warranty expense in the improvement in our gross margin from to which resulted from decreases in the inventory valuation allowance and warranty reserves as a percentage of revenues was almost entirely offset by a shift in sales to higher volume products which have lower margins 
these lower margin products are primarily associated with sales to our larger customers that receive volume discounts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity trading prices  which could affect our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and those of high quality corporate issuers 
we attempt to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market  and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair 
table of contents value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decline 
due to the short duration of most of the investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not necessarily have a direct impact on our earnings or cash flows 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected  to any significant degree  by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the securities portfolio 
the estimated fair value of our debt securities that we have invested in at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the effect of an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows 
foreign currency risk 
we pay the expenses of our international operations in local currencies  namely  the euro  british pound  new shekel  japanese yen  chinese renminbi and canadian dollar 
the international operations are subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  future results could be materially and adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the balance sheets and income statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars during the consolidation process 
because exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely affect overall expected profitability 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a net loss of thousand  thousand and thousand for the years ended december    and  respectively
