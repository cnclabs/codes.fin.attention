all statements other than statements of historical information provided herein are forward looking statements and may contain information about financial results  economic conditions  trends and known uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  which include those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this report under item a 
risk factors and the risks discussed in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect management s analysis  judgment  belief or expectation only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
overview we provide our services to customers typically pursuant to agreements with a term of one to three years and monthly payment installments 
as a result  these agreements provide us with a base of recurring revenue 
our revenue increases by adding new customers or additional services to existing customers 
our overall base of recurring revenue is affected by new customers  renewals or terminations of agreements with existing customers 
a large portion of the costs to operate our data centers  such as rent  product development and general and administrative expenses  does not depend strictly on the number of customers or the amount of services we provide 
as we add new customers or new services to existing customers  we generally incur limited additional expenses relating to telecommunications  utilities  hardware and software costs  and payroll expenses 
we have substantial capacity to add customers to our data centers 
our relatively fixed cost base  sufficient capacity for expansion and limited incremental variable costs provide us with the opportunity to grow profitably 
however  these same fixed costs present us with the risk that we may incur losses if we are unable to generate sufficient revenue 
in recent years  we have grown through acquisitions of new businesses and have restructured our historical operations 
specifically  in december  we acquired clearblue technologies management  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of our majority stockholder at the time of the acquisition and therefore was accounted for as a common control merger  adding application management and development capabilities to our managed application services 
in february  we acquired avasta  inc  adding capabilities to our managed application services 
in april  we acquired conxion corporation  providing key services to our managed application services and managed infrastructure services 
in may  we acquired assets of interliant  inc  forming the core of our managed messaging services 
in august and april  we acquired assets of cbt which was our majority stockholder at that time and therefore was accounted for as a common control merger related to colocation  bandwidth  security and disaster recovery services  enhancing our managed infrastructure services 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of surebridge  inc  adding significant capabilities to our managed application and professional services 
prior to september  substantially all of our services were managed application services 
we have added managed infrastructure and managed messaging services and increased managed applications and professional services since that time 
this transformation in our business will result in our recent results being more relevant to an understanding of our business than our historical results 
we also expect to make additional acquisitions to take advantage of our available capacity  which will have significant effects on our financial results in the future 
our acquisitions of cbtm and the assets and certain liabilities of cbt were accounted for in a manner similar to a pooling of interest due to common control ownership 
the assets and the liabilities of cbt  cbtm and navisite were combined at their historical amounts beginning on september   the date on which cbt obtained a majority ownership of navisite 
our acquisitions of avasta and conxion  selected assets of interliant and our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of surebridge were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and as such  the results of operations and cash flows relating to these acquisitions were included in our consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of cash flows from their respective dates of acquisition of february   april   may  and june  
table of contents we have made significant steps to improve the results of our operations 
due to improvements we have made in our overall business  the repayment of our maturing debt and our successful financing with silver point finance and the availability to us of committed lines of credit  our audit report no longer contains the opinion of our independent registered public accounting firm  kpmg llp  that our recurring losses as well as other factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern

income tax expense the company recorded million of deferred income tax expense during fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year and no deferred income tax expense in fiscal year no income tax benefit was recorded for the losses incurred due to a valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax expense resulted from tax goodwill amortization related to the surebridge asset acquisition in june and the acquisition of certain applied theory assets by clearblue technologies management  inc prior to the pooling of interest in december accordingly  the acquired goodwill and intangible assets for both acquisitions are amortizable for income tax purposes over fifteen years 
for financial statement purposes  goodwill is not amortized for either acquisition but is tested for impairment annually 
tax amortization of goodwill results in a taxable temporary difference  which will not reverse until the goodwill is impaired or written off for book purposes 
the resulting taxable temporary difference may not be offset by deductible temporary differences currently available  such as net operating loss carryforwards  which expire within a definite period

d on february   the company entered into an assignment and assumption agreement with a las vegas based company  whereby this company purchased from us the right to use  square feet in our las vegas data center  along with the infrastructure and equipment associated with this space 
in exchange  we received an initial payment of  and were to receive  per month over two years 
on may   we received full payment for the remaining unpaid balance 
this agreement shifts the responsibility for management of the data center and its employees  along with the maintenance of the facility s infrastructure  to this las vegas based company 
pursuant to this agreement  we have subleased back  square feet of space  allowing us to continue servicing our existing customer base in this market 
commitments related to property leases include an amount related to the  square feet sublease

off balance sheet financing arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases  which are recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
table of contents of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews the estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experiences  current conditions and future expectations 
the reviews are performed regularly and adjustments are made as required by current available information 
we believe these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue consists of monthly fees for web site and internet application management  hosting  colocation and professional services 
we also derive revenue from the sale of software and related maintenance contracts 
reimbursable expenses charged to customers are included in revenue and cost of revenue 
application management  hosting and colocation revenue is billed and recognized over the term of the contract  generally one to three years  based on actual usage 
installation fees associated with application management  hosting and colocation revenue are billed at the time the installation service is provided and recognized over the term of the related contract 
payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period such services are provided 
revenue from professional services is recognized on either a time and material basis as the services are performed or under the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts 
when current contract estimates indicate that a loss is probable  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated service costs of the contract exceed the estimated revenue that will be generated by the contract 
unbilled accounts receivable represents revenue for services performed that have not been billed 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue from the sale of software is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in instances where we also provide application management and hosting services in conjunction with the sale of software  software revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the expected customer relationship period 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors 
if it is determined subsequent to our initial evaluation and at any time during the arrangement that collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized as cash is received 
due to the nature of our service arrangements  we provide written notice of termination of services  typically days in advance of disconnecting a customer 
revenue for services rendered during this notification period is generally recognized on a cash basis as collectability is not considered probable at the time the services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and generally do not require collateral or other security against trade receivables 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivables and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and consider historical bad debts  customer and industry concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for of the balance of customer accounts deemed uncollectible 
for all other customer accounts  we reserve for of the balance over days old and of all other customer balances 
changes in economic conditions or the financial viability of our customers may result in additional provisions for doubtful accounts in excess of our current estimate 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  subject to amortization and depreciation  including customer lists and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  
table of contents significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are valued at the lower of the carrying amount or their fair value less disposal costs 
property and equipment is primarily comprised of leasehold improvements  computer and office equipment and software licenses 
intangible assets consist of customer lists 
we review the valuation of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not an impairment loss has been incurred  we review the valuation of goodwill on an interim basis 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
impairment losses are recognized in operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
we have not used derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our investment portfolio or entered into hedging transactions 
however  under our senior secured term loan facility with silver point finance  we are required to have interest rate protection which shall effectively limit the unadjusted libor component of the interest costs of our loan with respect to not less than of the principal amount at a rate not more than per annum 
our exposure to market risk associated with risk sensitive instruments entered into for purposes other than trading purposes is not material to us 
we currently have no significant foreign operations and therefore face no material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our interest rate risk at july  was limited mainly to the london inter bank offered rate libor on our outstanding loan with our senior secured term loan facility with silver point finance 
at july  we had no open derivative positions with respect to our borrowing arrangements 
had our senior secured term loan facility with silver point finance been outstanding for the full fiscal year  a hypothetical basis point increase in the libor rate would have resulted in an approximate million increase in our interest expense for the fiscal year ended july
