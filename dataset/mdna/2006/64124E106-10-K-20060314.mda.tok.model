overview since its inception in september  neurogen has been engaged in the discovery and development of drugs 
the company has not derived any revenue or earnings from product sales and has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenues or earnings 
revenues to date have come from six collaborative research agreements  one license agreement and one technology transfer agreement 
during  the company incurred significant expenses in conducting three phase i clinical trials and initiating the phase ii trial for ng development costs for the insomnia program  as well as costs for the company s other programs  may continue to increase in over the last three years  drug discovery and development activities  excluding stock compensation charges  have accounted for between and of total expenses 
collaborative agreements have been and are expected to continue to be a source of funding for the company 
such arrangements not only drive current revenue through the recognition of upfront and subsequent license fees  research funding and potential milestone payments  but over the longer term these arrangements may have a significant impact on potential future product revenue and earnings in the form of royalties if the agreements result in successful drug development and commercialization 
the initiation  expiration and specific terms of such agreements have contributed to  and will continue to cause  significant fluctuations in the company s recognized revenues and losses 
the company will continue to seek early stage partnerships for some research and development programs  while it selectively retains the rights to other drug programs to more advanced stages before considering partnership arrangements 
the decision of whether and when to partner a program is based on an analysis of development risk  resources required to complete each regulatory stage  and the amount of immediate versus long term return that could be extracted at each stage of development 
in december  neurogen and merck sharp dohme limited merck entered into a collaboration agreement the merck agreement to discover and develop next generation drugs targeting the vanilloid receptor vr for the treatment of pain 
neurogen received million in january  of which million was for up front license fees and page million for the purchase of  shares of newly issued neurogen common stock 
merck is obligated to provide neurogen with research funding and license payments totaling million during the initial three year term of the contract subject to merck s right of termination in the third year 
the collaboration is entering its third year  and  as of december   neurogen has received million in research funding and two million anniversary license payments  as well as an additional million for the achievement of a preclinical milestone 
in the second quarter of  the company was informed that the connecticut department of environmental protection the dep is considering taking action against the company as a result of incidents where the company s wastewater monitoring systems indicated that the wastewater ph limits of the company s wastewater discharge permit had been exceeded 
however  no formal communication has been received from the dep as of the date of this filing 
the actions the dep could take include  but are not limited to  fines  penalties  remedial action and future additional monitoring activities 
at this time  the company does not have enough information to enable it to estimate the cost  if any  of the dep s actions and  accordingly  no amounts have been recorded in the accompanying financial statements for this matter 
the company is not aware of any negative environmental impacts resulting from these incidents but continues to carefully monitor and upgrade its wastewater neutralization systems in an effort to prevent further incidents of this kind 
critical accounting policies the preparation of neurogen s financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment  which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes estimates and exercises judgment in the valuation of marketable securities and investments  evaluation of investments and other assets for other than temporary impairment  revenue recognition  collaboration costs  income taxes  accruals and stock compensation 
actual amounts and outcomes could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of neurogen s financial statements revenue recognition neurogen s current collaboration with merck and any related agreements are significant since the terms of such arrangements may cause the company s operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
periodically  neurogen enters into collaborative research agreements that  among other things  generally provide for the funding to neurogen of specified projects and the granting to neurogen s partners of certain development and commercialization rights related to potential discoveries 
revenue under these arrangements typically includes upfront non refundable fees  ongoing payments for specified levels of staffing for research and milestone payments upon occurrence of certain events 
the company recognizes upfront license fees as revenue ratably over the period of performance under the research agreement 
the research funding is recognized as revenue as the related research effort is performed 
revenue derived from the achievement of milestones  each of which represents a substantive stage of development towards a long term goal such as the nomination of a development or clinical candidate or the start of a specific phase of clinical trials or the filing of a new drug application with the food and drug administration  is recognized when the milestone event occurs and page collectability is reasonably assured 
in december  the sec released sab  which amended sab to incorporate guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this eitf became effective for all contracts entered into after june  eitf issue no 
addresses  for arrangements with multiple deliverables  how the arrangement consideration should be measured  whether the arrangement should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
neurogen applied the guidance in eitf issue no 
in evaluating the proper accounting for the merck agreement  which became effective in late december the company identified the initial license transfer and the research and development services as the deliverables under the merck agreement and concluded that they should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting based on the determination that these deliverables were not separable 
the company believes that the achievement of specific milestones  such as the identification of a preclinical candidate or the acceptance of an nda filing  is well defined  substantive  measurable and reasonable relative to risk and effort 
accordingly  neurogen concluded that such payments should be recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved 
on the basis of the evaluation discussed above and consistent with the provisions of eitf issue no 
and sab  as amended by sab  the company recognized revenue from the upfront license payment ratably over the potential five year term of the research program under the merck agreement  subsequent anniversary license payments ratably over the remaining duration of the research program under the collaboration  and research funding as incurred with the expectation that the research funding revenue will approximate straight line revenue over the term of the contract 
milestone payments to date have been  and any future milestone payments will be recognized as earned  provided payment is reasonably assured 
the company has recognized revenue from the aventis agreement  entered into in december  in accordance with the guidance in sab an initial license fee of million received in december was recognized ratably over the then expected performance period of five years which covered the initial term of three years and possible extensions of up to another two years 
in september  as a result of the combination of aventis with sanofi synthelabo  aventis informed the company that the collaboration would terminate in december as the termination was effective december   the company made an adjustment in september to the period over which the initial license fee payment was being recognized  such that all revenues would be recognized by december consistent with the guidance in accounting principles board apb opinion that related to a change in accounting estimate  the remaining unearned license revenue as of the end of august was recognized ratably over the period from september to december revenue resulting from up front and subsequent such as anniversary license payments and non refundable fees under collaborative research agreements are recorded as license fees revenue for purposes of the financial statements 
research funding for the company s staffing on projects and milestone payments under collaborative agreements is recorded as research and development revenue 
deferred revenue arises from the payments received for research and development to be conducted in future periods or for licenses of neurogen s rights or technology where neurogen has continuing involvement 
research and development costs all research and development costs  which primarily include scientific salaries and benefits  laboratory supplies  external research studies  compound formulation and manufacturing and overhead facilities expenses  are expensed as incurred 
page stock based compensation the company accounts for grants of stock options and restricted stock utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  recognizes no compensation expense for the options when the option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant 
the company primarily grants qualified stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
the company has also issued restricted stock to key executives and records an expense over the vesting periods 
the company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the issuance of sfas no 
r will significantly change the way the company accounts for grants of stock options 
this new pronouncement and its potential impact are discussed in the section titled recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the company occasionally grants stock option awards to consultants 
such grants are accounted for pursuant to eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and  accordingly  recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of such awards and amortizes such expense over the performance period 
the fair value of each award is estimated using the black scholes model the assumptions used are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
marketable securities marketable securities at each of december   and december  consisted of us treasury obligations  direct obligations of us government agencies  investment grade asset backed securities and corporate debt securities 
at december  maturities ranged from approximately one month to approximately years and at december  from approximately one month to approximately years 
the company has classified all marketable securities as current under arb paragraph such guidance indicates that a current classification is appropriate for resources such as marketable securities representing the investment of cash available for current operations 
the fair value of these securities is subject to volatility and change 
the company considers its investment portfolio to be available for sale securities as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses reported as other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses have been determined by the specific identification method and are included in investment income 
classifications of the company s marketable securities as other than available for sale pursuant to sfas no 
would possibly result in material impacts to the valuation of the securities and investment income 
neurogen periodically reviews its marketable securities portfolio for potential other than temporary impairment and recoverability 
gross unrealized losses for all investments in an unrealized loss position on the company s investments totaled million on aggregate fair value of million as of december  the company believes that the decline in market values of these investments resulted primarily from rising interest rates and not credit quality 
based on the contractual terms and credit quality of these securities  and current market conditions  the company does not consider it probable that any of them will be settled by the issuer at a price less than the amortized cost of the investments 
since the company believes it has the ability and intends to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be at maturity  and because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  the company does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  page income taxes the liability method of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  is used to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards  research and development credit carryforwards  and differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
any subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be recorded as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations or a credit to additional paid in capital 
long lived assets in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement provides that a an impairment loss should only be recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  and b the measurement of impairment loss should be based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
it also provides that a long lived asset or asset group should be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment has occurred 
in addition  it provides for the use of probability weighted cash flow estimates in the recoverability test 
the company performs an annual review for possible impairment indicators and  if any are noted  would then perform a more substantive review for potential impairment of the relevant long lived asset or asset group 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of income earned under existing or future collaborative research agreements  the progress of the company s independent and partnered research and development projects  the size of the company s staff and the level of preclinical and clinical development spending on drug candidates in unpartnered programs 
neurogen believes its research and development costs may increase significantly over the next several years as its drug development programs progress 
in addition  general and administrative expenses would be expected to increase to support any expanded research and development activities 
years ended december  and operating revenues for were million compared to million in the million decrease in was primarily due to the termination of the company s research collaboration with aventis in september discussed below and the recognition in april of million from the achievement of a preclinical milestone in the merck agreement 
total revenue from the aventis collaboration in was million  which included million in license fees of which million was from the acceleration of all remaining previously deferred license revenue upon the termination and million in research funding 
license fees from the merck agreement were million in as compared to million in  primarily due to million recognized in from the license payment of million received in december  revenue from which is being recognized ratably over four years from initial recognition through the duration of the research program 
research revenue from the merck agreement decreased slightly to million in from million in page research and development expenses for were million compared to million in excluding non cash stock compensation charges  which was a million or increase 
spending on clinical trials and development costs increased for several of the company s programs 
outsourced expenses of million were incurred for three phase i clinical trials and the commencement of the phase ii clinical trial for ng for insomnia in  compared to expenses of million in for the completion of the company s exploratory phase iia clinical trials for both asthma and rheumatoid arthritis indications in the ca program 
outsourced development expenses for toxicology studies  chemical manufacturing and formulations related to the insomnia  obesity  and depression anxiety programs increased by million to million in compared to development spending of million in  of which million and million of the development expenses in and  respectively  were for insomnia program costs 
staff salary and benefit expense to support the company s development efforts increased by million to million  which included an average headcount increase of in utility costs increased million to million in the company expenses all research and development costs as incurred 
while the company maintains a system to record the level of staff time spent on each of its research and development projects  it does not maintain a historical cost accounting system with sufficient accuracy to reliably estimate its research and development costs on a specific project by project basis 
a significant portion of the company s research and development expenses such as laboratory supplies  travel  information systems and services and facilities costs benefit multiple projects and are not individually tracked to a specific project 
further  the company s staff timekeeping system does not account for differences in compensation costs between lower level technicians and more senior scientists 
in  general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock compensation charges  increased by to million as compared to million in the million increase was due primarily to increases in salary and benefits expense of million and in recruiting expenses of million in total stock compensation expenses were million in compared to million in since the company accounts for employee stock options using the intrinsic method  and the company grants stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair market value  the granting of employee options normally does not result in any compensation expense being recognized for those awards 
the stock compensation expenses that were recognized in and consisted of restricted stock awards granted to employees and certain grants to consultants 
the amount also included expense for certain variable option grants awarded to several officers in which were expensed over the vesting period that ended december   and the expense amounts were marked to market at each reporting date 
other income was million in compared to million in the million increase in was primarily due to an increase in interest income resulting from a higher average level of marketable securities in  offset by a slight increase in interest expense and a decline in realized gains on the sale or maturity of investments 
the company recognized and recorded connecticut income tax benefits of million and million in and  respectively  a portion of which in related to employee stock options and was recorded to additional paid in capital 
the and benefits were the result of connecticut legislation which allowed the company to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut for a portion of research and development tax credits in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of these credits into future tax years 
page years ended december  and operating revenues for were million compared to million in the million increase in operating revenues was primarily due to revenue generated in from the merck agreement  which consisted of million in license fees  million in research funding  and million for the achievement of a preclinical milestone  as compared to the recognition in of less than million in revenue from the collaboration 
revenues from the aventis agreement increased in by million  as license fees increased by million over the million recognized in  reflecting the accelerated recognition of all remaining previously deferred license revenue upon the agreement termination 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in research funding revenues to million in and the absence of milestone revenue of million in research and development expenses for of million decreased slightly from million in  excluding non cash stock compensation charges 
increases in of million in research supplies  million in outsourced drug development costs  and million in recruiting and relocation expenses were offset by a million decrease in clinical expenses from the completion of the company s exploratory phase iia clinical trials for both asthma and rheumatoid arthritis indications in its ca program 
costs incurred for the ng clinical trial for insomnia that commenced in december were approximately million 
the million increase in outsourced drug development expenses in was caused by increases in toxicology studies and formulation expenses related to the insomnia program  offsetting decreases in chemical manufacturing costs related to the vr program as these expenses are now borne by merck 
the annual average level of research and development staffing in was approximately the same as for the year end research and development staff level was about higher than at december  in  general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock compensation charges  increased by to million as compared to million in the million increase was due to a million increase in audit and consultant fees primarily related to sarbanes oxley act compliance  as well as increases in salary and benefits expense of million  other general legal and administrative expenses including travel  training and general legal and patent expense of million  and fees paid to the board of directors of million 
headcount during remained at levels comparable to the headcount 
total stock compensation expenses were million in both and since the company accounts for employee stock options using the intrinsic method  and the company grants stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair market value  the granting of employee options normally does not result in any compensation expense being recognized for those awards 
the stock compensation expenses that were recognized in and consisted of restricted stock awards granted to employees  certain variable option grants awarded to several officers in which were expensed over the vesting period that ended december   and the expense amounts were marked to market at each reporting date  and certain grants to consultants 
other income was million in compared to million in the increase in was due primarily to an increase in interest income arising from the proceeds of up front payments received under the merck agreement and stock sold in the april private placement referred to in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
interest expense decreased by approximately million during compared to  due to lower outstanding loan balances 
the company recognized and recorded connecticut income tax benefits of million in both and the and benefits were the result of connecticut legislation which allowed the company to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut for a portion of research and development tax credits in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of these credits into future tax years 
page liquidity and capital resources cash and marketable securities at december  and cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in the aggregate were million and million  respectively 
at december   million of the marketable securities had maturities beyond one year 
however  the company can and may liquidate such investments prior to maturity to meet its strategic and or investment objectives 
the company s combined cash and other short term investments decreased in due to the funding of operating expenses and payments on outstanding loans described below  partially offset by the receipt of million in research funding and million in anniversary license fees 
in the company received million from merck  which included million for the purchase of  shares of neurogen common stock and million as upfront license fees pursuant to the merck agreement  and the receipt of million before closing costs of million for the sale of  newly issued shares of neurogen common stock to warburg pincus private equity viii  lp  entities affiliated with baker brothers investments and entities affiliated with the tisch family in a private placement transaction 
the levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to do so in the future as a result of operating needs and financing events 
the company intends to use its cash to utilize the capabilities of its drug discovery platform and to enhance its capacity to pursue new drug targets  as well as fund general and corporate overhead 
the company may also use its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to selectively advance certain drug research and development programs internally to more advanced stages than it has historically done before considering partnership arrangements 
neurogen believes this may allow it to retain a greater portion of commercial rights  potentially establish more valuable partnerships  and retain greater control over the drug development process 
debt arrangements the debt agreements entered into by the company to date include a commercial term mortgage loan financing in december with webster bank  and a construction loan entered into in october with connecticut innovations  inc cii 
total proceeds received under these agreements were million  which are repayable through monthly installments over a maximum term of years 
the interest rate on the cii facility is fixed at an annual rate of  and the interest rate on the webster facility  tied to the one month libor rate  averaged and in and  respectively 
of these amounts borrowed  million and million remained outstanding as of december  under the webster bank facility and the cii facility  respectively 
an approximate aggregate amount of million in principal payments is due and payable in each of the next five years 
thereafter  the remaining aggregate balance of approximately million is payable in regular monthly installments until the scheduled maturity dates  including a balloon payment of million on the mortgage loan with webster bank upon maturity in december as of december   neurogen does not have any significant lease or capital expenditure commitments 
under the terms of the amended webster bank facility agreement  the company is required to comply with certain covenants  including a requirement that the company maintain at least million in cash and or marketable securities 
a separate loan to value covenant required that the ratio of the outstanding loan balance less any cash collateral to the appraised value of the real property not exceed 
in january  the company was notified by webster bank that an appraisal received by the bank suggested that the value of the property had declined 
in march  the company paid down the balance of the principal by million over previously scheduled payments  in exchange for amending the loan agreement to remove the loan to value covenant 
page following notification from webster bank of the lower appraised value of its property  the company reviewed the carrying value of its buildings and improvements for possible impairment and recoverability pursuant to sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
based on the company s estimated future cash flows for the remaining useful lives of the building and improvements  the company concluded that the carrying value of the assets was recoverable as defined by sfas therefore  the company determined that it was unnecessary to record an impairment loss or adjust the carrying value of the company s building and improvements 
evaluation of investments for other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb staff position fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments described below  the company reviewed its marketable securities portfolio  which consists of us treasury obligations  direct obligations of us government agencies  investment grade asset backed securities and corporate debt obligations  for potential other than temporary impairment 
gross unrealized losses related to the company s investments totaled million on aggregate fair value of million for all investments in unrealized loss positions as of december  out of a total of marketable securities held at december   securities with a market value of million have been in a continuous loss position for twelve months or more  and the related unrealized loss was million 
the company believes that the decline in market values of these investments resulted primarily from rising interest rates and not credit quality 
the company believes it has the intent and ability to hold investments that mature in the next twelve months until the fair market value is recovered 
unrealized losses related to securities that mature beyond the next twelve months  and that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more  amounted to million  or  of the total market value of such marketable securities as of december  the company has not recorded any losses for other than temporary impairment at this time  however  if interest rates rise and such unrealized losses become more significant  the company may record impairment losses 
in evaluating the unrealized losses the company considered the nature of the investments  current credit ratings  maturity dates and the company s projected cash requirements 
financing activities neurogen s cash requirements to date have been met by the proceeds of its equity financing activities  amounts received pursuant to collaborative research  licensing or technology transfer arrangements  certain debt arrangements and interest earned on invested funds 
the company s equity financing activities have included underwritten public offerings of common stock  private placement offerings of common stock and private sales of common stock in connection with collaborative research and licensing agreements 
the company s expenditures have funded research and development  general and administrative expenses  and the construction and outfitting of its research and development facilities 
the company may from time to time  as warranted by its operating and strategic requirements  augment its cash balance through financing transactions  including the issuance of debt or equity securities and further corporate alliances 
the page company filed an s registration statement that became effective in february  under which the company may issue debt  common or preferred stock or warrants of up to million in total financing 
to date  the company has issued million in common stock pursuant to this s registration statement 
no assurances can be given that adequate levels of additional funding can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
in may the company filed with the sec a registration statement on form s to enable the resale of  shares of newly issued shares of neurogen common stock acquired in a private placement transaction by warburg pincus private equity viii  lp  entities affiliated with baker brothers investments and entities affiliated with the tisch family 
the registration statement became effective in november the company is in the early stage of product development 
the company has not derived any product revenues from product sales and does not expect to derive any product revenues for at least the next several years  if at all 
prior to deriving any such product revenues  the company expects to incur significant losses and negative cash flows that in the aggregate could exceed the company s existing cash resources 
to provide cash to fund its operations until such time as it achieves sustainable revenues  the company relies extensively on its ability to develop drug discovery programs of sufficient value to either partner the programs with pharmaceutical companies or raise capital through equity or debt financings 
to the extent that drug candidates progress in the company s currently unpartnered programs  such as its proprietary insomnia program  its program for the treatment of depression and anxiety  its program to treat obesity  or earlier stage programs  such progress could lead to the opportunity to partner on terms which provide capital  revenues and cash flows to the company or the opportunity to raise capital through equity or debt offerings 
if unpartnered programs do not progress or do not progress on schedule  such opportunities would be delayed or may not materialize at all 
to the extent that drug candidates progress in the company s partnered programs  such as the company s vr program partnered with merck  such progress could result in milestone payments and additional research and development funding to the company under the respective collaboration agreements 
such progress could also provide the opportunity to raise capital through equity offerings 
if partnered programs do not progress or do not progress on schedule  such opportunities would be delayed or may not materialize at all 
the company does not have control over the progress of partnered programs 
lack of progress  scheduling delays or failures in any of the company s major programs could significantly reduce the company s levels of revenues  cash flows and cash available to fund its business 
these factors could also significantly increase the company s cost of capital and limit its ability to raise equity or debt 
all of the company s compounds in development  whether in human clinical trials or not  will require significant additional research  development and testing before they can be commercialized 
furthermore  the scope  magnitude and timing of future research and development expenses  as well as anticipated project completion dates  are a series of steps  ranging from preclinical testing to clinical studies in humans 
each step in the process is typically more expensive than the previous step  but actual timing and cost for completion depends on the specific progress of each product being tested 
while the company cannot accurately predict the time required or the cost involved in commercializing any one of its candidates  new drug development typically takes many years and tens or hundreds of millions of dollars 
in addition  page developing new drugs is an extremely uncertain process where most candidates fail and uncertain developments such as clinical or regulatory delays  side effects  undesirable drug properties or ineffectiveness of a drug candidate would slow or prevent the development of a product 
if neurogen or its partners are unable to commercialize one or more of our drug products  the company may never achieve product revenues and may eventually be unable to continue operations 
this result would cause its stockholders to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment 
neurogen anticipates that its current cash balance  as supplemented by research funding and annual license payments pursuant to its collaborative research agreement with merck  will be sufficient to fund its current and planned operations through mid however  neurogen s funding requirements may change and will depend upon numerous factors  including but not limited to the progress of the company s research and development programs  the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical studies  the timing of regulatory approvals  technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of its proposed products  the status of competitive products and the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others for the purpose of funding certain research and development programs  conducting clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  manufacturing and marketing products 
many of these factors could significantly increase the company s expenses and use of cash 
tax benefits as of december   the company has approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards and million and research and development credit carryforwards available for federal income tax purposes  which expire in the years through the company also has approximately million in connecticut state tax net operating loss carryforwards  which expire in the years through  and million of connecticut non incremental research and development credit carryforwards with an unlimited carryforward period 
the company applied to exchange  and connecticut research and development credits for cash proceeds under connecticut tax law provisions effective at that time as mentioned above  resulting in a receivable of million from the state of connecticut as of december  and the receipt of million in relating to the exchange of the research and development credits 
due to change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  the company s utilization of its net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods 
in the company reviewed its changes in ownership through a testing date of december  and determined that an ownership change occurred in this change did not result however  in reducing the net operating losses that existed through that date 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth a summary of the company s commitments as of december  in thousands page payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations total the above amounts include future interest payments 
the portion of the interest payments related to the company s mortgage loan agreement which carries a floating interest rate based on the one month libor rate was estimated based on the applicable interest rate of as of december the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
research collaborations merck in december  neurogen entered into a collaboration agreement with merck to research  develop  and commercialize small molecule medicines which work by targeting the vanilloid receptor vr  a key integrator of pain signals in the nervous system 
in january  under the terms of the merck agreement  the company received a payment of million for license fees and sold to merck  shares of newly issued neurogen common stock for an additional million 
merck has agreed  among other things  to fund a specified level of discovery and research resources for three years and to pay additional license fees aggregating million on the first three anniversary dates of the collaboration 
merck has the option to extend the discovery and research effort for up to an additional two years  merck also has the right to terminate the agreement at any time and transfer rights to the collaborative program to neurogen 
merck had not exercised the right to terminate as of the date of this filing 
as of december   the company has received million of research funding from merck 
the company is eligible to receive milestone payments if certain compound discovery  product development or regulatory objectives are achieved through the collaboration 
in april  neurogen and merck achieved a preclinical milestone that triggered a payment to neurogen and the recording of revenue in the amount of million 
the cash was received in may also under the merck agreement  merck is responsible for funding the cost of development  including clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing of collaboration products  if any
