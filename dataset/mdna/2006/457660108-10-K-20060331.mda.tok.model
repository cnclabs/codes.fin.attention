the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this form k 
overview we are an ophthalmic product development company focused on ophthalmic pharmaceutical products based on our proprietary durasite eyedrop based drug delivery technology  as well as developing genetically based technologies for the diagnosis  prognosis and management of glaucoma 
we face significant challenges related to our lack of financial resources 
we only expect our current cash to enable us to continue our operations as currently planned until approximately the end of june our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report related to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  referring to our recurring operating losses and a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
with our existing resources we are focusing our research and development and commercial efforts on the following azasite isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin  a broad spectrum antibiotic  and azasite plus isv  a durasite formulation of azithromycin and a steroid for inflammation and pain 
azasite isv 
to treat bacterial conjunctivitis and other infections of the outer eye we have developed a topical formulation azasite of the antibiotic azithromycin  an antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity that is widely used to treat respiratory and other infections in its oral and parenteral forms 
we believe that the key advantages of azasite may include a significantly reduced dosing regimen doses vs 
doses for comparable products  enabled by the high and persistent levels of azithromycin achieved by our formulation in the tissues of the eye and its wide spectrum of activity 
product safety and efficacy have been shown  respectively  in phase and phase clinical trials 
the phase study compared an azasite formulation containing azithromycin to a placebo 
the results of this study showed that the azasite formulation was significantly more effective than the placebo in clinical resolution p  which includes reduction in inflammation and redness  and bacterial eradication p in july  we initiated two pivotal phase clinical trials for azasite which were conducted both in the united states and in select latin american countries 
one of the phase clinical trials was a multi center study in which patients in one arm were dosed with a azasite formulation and the patients in the second arm were dosed with a formulation of the antibiotic tobramycin 
in november  we announced that upon completion of enrollment this study included a total of patients year or older  of which were confirmed positive for acute bacterial conjunctivitis in at least one eye 
the results of this phase study indicated that azasite demonstrated a clinical resolution rate of as compared to for tobramycin 
this result shows that the clinical resolution rate of azasite is equivalent to tobramycin  the primary efficacy endpoint of the study  according to statistical criteria which were previously agreed to by the fda 
the bacterial eradication rate was also equivalent for both groups 
the other phase clinical trial was a multi center study in which patients in one arm were dosed with a azasite formulation and the patients in the second arm were dosed with a placebo 
in january we completed enrollment in this study of approximately patients  of which approximately were confirmed positive for acute bacterial conjunctivitis in at least one eye 
in march  we announced that the results of this study showed that the azasite formulation was more effective than the placebo in clinical resolution  which includes reduction in inflammation and redness  while also being superior in bacterial eradication over placebo 
in september  we signed a manufacturing supply agreement with cardinal health for the manufacture of azasite commercial units 
cardinal health has manufactured the clinical trial supplies used in our two phase bacterial conjunctivitis clinical trials  and also the registration batches to be used for the azasite new drug application 
we anticipate that this contract manufacturing facility will be ready for inspection by the fda soon after our nda submission 
azasite plus isv 
our first effort toward the expansion of our product candidate azasite into a larger franchise is the development of a combination of azasite with an anti inflammatory steroid for the treatment of blepharitis  an infection of the eyelid and one of the most common eye problems in older adults 
this combination product candidate is currently in preclinical development and will be more actively pursued as personnel and financial resources become available and as activities to support the azasite nda are completed 
we anticipate initiating phase clinical trials in revenue 
from our inception through the end of  we did not receive any revenues from the sale of our products  other than a small amount of royalties from the sale of our aquasite product by ciba vision and global damon 
in the fourth quarter of  we commercially launched our ocugene glaucoma genetic test and early in we began to receive a small amount of revenues from the sale of this test 
with the exception of and the six month period ended june   we have been unprofitable since our inception due to continuing research and development efforts  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacturing of our product candidates 
we have financed our research and development activities and operations primarily through private and public placements of our equity securities  issuance of convertible debentures and  to a lesser extent  from collaborative agreements and bridge loans 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition 
we recognize up front fees from licensing and similar arrangements over the expected term of the related research and development services using the straight line method 
when changes in the expected term of ongoing services are identified  the amortization period for the remaining fees is appropriately modified 
revenue related to performance milestones is recognized when the milestone is achieved based on the terms set forth in the related agreements 
revenue related to contract research services is recognized when the services are provided and collectibility is reasonable assured 
during the years ended and  we recognized cost reimbursements as contract and other revenue in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursement for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we recognize the received cost sharing payments when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we receive royalties from licensees based on third party sales and the royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms  when third party results are reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue related to sales of our product  the ocugene glaucoma genetic test  is recognized when all related services have been rendered and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accordingly  revenue for sales of ocugene may be recognized in a later period than the associated recognition of costs of the services provided  especially during the initial launch of the product 
the revenue in connection with the sale of isv to b l was recognized over the contract period 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses include salaries  benefits  facility costs  services provided by outside consultants and contractors  administrative costs and materials for our research and development activities 
we also fund research at a variety of academic institutions based on agreements that are generally cancelable 
we recognize such costs as they are incurred 
cost of goods 
we recognize the cost of inventory shipped and other costs related to our ocugene glaucoma genetic test when they are incurred 
inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the inventory is based on the first in first out method 
if the cost of the inventory exceeds the expected market value a provision is recorded for the difference between cost and market 
at december  and  our inventory solely consisted of ocugene kits which are considered finished goods 
results of operations revenues 
we had total net revenues of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  from contract research activities and sales of ocugene 
the increase in revenue in was due to contract research activities conducted for bausch lomb in and under the isv asset purchase agreement 
we are no longer providing services to b l and we do not expect to derive revenue from these activities in or future years 
cost of goods 
cost of goods of   and  for  and  respectively  reflect the cost of ocugene tests performed as well as the cost of sample collection kits distributed for use 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the majority of this increase represents increases in the cost of the clinical research organizations and microbiological testing related to our azasite phase clinical trials 
the remainder of the increase mainly reflects costs related to consultants and temporary labor to assist with the preparation of the azasite new drug application nda 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the majority of this increase is due to the initiation of our azasite phase clinical trials and production of the related clinical supplies and registration batches 
the remainder of the increase reflects salary increases for our research staff to return such salaries to the same level they were prior to the voluntary salary reductions instituted in and costs related to increased research activities in support of our azasite program 
our r d activities can be separated into two major segments  research and clinical development 
research includes activities involved in evaluating a potential product  related pre clinical testing and manufacturing 
clinical development includes activities related to filings with the fda and the related human clinical testing required to obtain marketing approval for a potential product 
we estimate that the following represents the approximate cost of these activities for  and in thousands research clinical development total research and development although the majority of our personnel were focused on our azasite program in  due to our limited personnel and the number of projects that we are developing  our personnel are involved in a number of projects at the same time 
accordingly  the majority of our r d expenses are not linked to a specific project but are allocated across projects  based on personnel time expended on each project 
accordingly  the allocated costs may not reflect the actual costs of each project 
the decrease in research activities in compared to mainly reflected the decrease in manufacturing activities as expenses related to the production of clinical supplies for the phase azasite trials were incurred mainly in the increase in research activities in compared to reflected salary increases for our research staff to return such salaries to the same level they were prior to the voluntary salary reductions instituted in and costs related to increased patent and research activities in support of the azasite program 
clinical development expenses were million in  million in and million in the majority of the increase is related to our azasite phase clinical trials which were initiated in the remainder of the increase reflects increased staffing to support our azasite clinical trials and preparation for the filing of the azasite nda 
most of our projects are in the early stages of the product development cycle and may not result in commercial products 
projects in development may not proceed into clinical trials due to a number of reasons even though the project looks promising early in the process 
once a project reaches clinical trials it may be found to be ineffective or there may be harmful side effects 
additionally  during the development cycle  other companies may develop new treatments that decrease the market potential for our project or be issued patents that require us to negotiate a license or cease pursuing one of our products and we may decide not to proceed 
other factors including the cost of manufacturing at a commercial scale and the availability of quality manufacturing capabilities could negatively impact our ability to bring the project to the market 
also  our business strategy is to license projects to third parties to complete the development cycle and to market and sell the product 
if we are unable to enter into collaborative arrangements for any product candidate  our ability to commercialize the product may be slowed or we may decide not to proceed with that candidate 
these collaborative arrangements may either speed the development or they may extend the anticipated time to market 
because of these factors  as well as others  we cannot be certain if  or when  our projects in development will complete the development cycle and be commercialized 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in legal expenses increased in mainly due to costs associated with the bristol arbitration which was settled in additionally  in costs were incurred for marketing studies related to the azasite and azasite plus product candidates 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from in personnel related expenses increased in due to the payment of performance bonuses to our selling  general and administrative personnel in june and salary increases to these staff members to return such salaries to the same level they were prior to the salary reduction in this increase was partially offset by a reduction in our legal and financial service activities as expenses incurred in the second half of towards raising funds were not incurred in the second half of interest  other income expenses 
net interest  other income expense was an expense of   and  in  and  respectively 
the decreased expense in mainly reflects the lower average balance of debt outstanding during compared to as we did not close the december tranche of the senior secured notes until december  the change from to principally reflects the  of interest expense related to the debt discount of the convertible debentures recorded in  and interest expense related to the short term notes payable in and any interest earned or paid in the future will be dependent on our ability to raise additional funding and prevailing interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments from corporate collaborations 
at december   our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were million 
it is our policy to invest our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  treasury and federal agency notes and corporate debt 
our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit report referring to our recurring operating losses and a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
absent additional funding from private or public equity or debt financings  collaborative or other partnering arrangements  asset sales  or other sources  we expect that our cash on hand including cash received for warrant exercises after december  and from the january closing of our senior secured notes financing  anticipated cash flow from operations and current cash commitments to us will only be adequate to fund our operations until approximately the end of june if we are unable to secure sufficient additional funding prior to that time  we will need to cease operations and liquidate our assets  which are secured by the senior secured notes 
our financial statements were prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
even if we are able to obtain additional financing in order to continue long term operations beyond approximately the end of june  we will require and will seek additional funding through collaborative or other partnering arrangements  public or private equity or debt financings  asset sales and from other sources 
however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain interim or longer term financing or that such funding  if obtained  will be sufficient to continue our operations as currently conducted or in a manner necessary for the continued development of our products or the long term success of our company 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  such debt will be secured by a security interest or pledge of all of our assets  will require us to make principal and interest payments  would likely include the issuance of warrants and may subject us to restrictive covenants 
in addition  our stockholders may suffer substantial dilution if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities 
for the years ended december   and  cash used for operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities were  and  primarily related to cash outlays for additions to laboratory and other equipment and a change in restricted cash during and  respectively 
in proceeds received from investing activities of  were related primarily to the sale of assets 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of short term senior secured notes in december and net proceeds of million from the final closing of the sale of notes in january the notes issued in december bear interest at a rate of and are due on june   but the maturity date may be extended at our option to december  and would bear a interest rate during that period 
the notes issued in january also bear interest at a rate of and are due july   but the maturity date may be extended at our option to january  and would bear a interest rate during that period 
we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock in a may private placement 
we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of an aggregate of million shares of common stock in the initial and final closings of the march private placement 
we received million in the first quarter of from the issuance of  shares of our series a preferred stock to b l under the isv license agreement 
we issued million of short term notes payable in to directors  members of senior management and other stockholders 
these notes bear interest at rates from to and are due from january  through march  in and we repaid  and  respectively  of these notes in cash 
in the year ended december  we received  net of debt issuance costs of approximately  from the issuance of convertible debentures 
these debentures were later converted into  shares of common stock in in  we received  from the issuance of our common stock from the exercise of stock options by employees  purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and exercises of warrants to purchase common stock compared to  in and  in during we also received  in connection with private placements of our common stock 
we received payments on a note to a stockholder of   and  in  and  respectively 
we also made  of payments on capital leases for certain laboratory equipment in compared to  in assuming we are able to obtain additional financing and continue our operations  our future capital expenditures and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of our clinical testing  research and development programs and preclinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to successfully commercialize azasite  ocugene and any other products that we may launch in the future  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing collaborative and licensing relationships  acquisition of new businesses  products and technologies  the completion of commercialization activities and arrangements  and the purchase of additional property and equipment 
we anticipate no material capital expenditures to be incurred for environmental compliance in fiscal year based on our environmental compliance record to date  and our belief that we are current in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  environmental compliance is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods 
some of these amounts are based on management s estimate and assumptions about these obligations including their duration  the possibility of renewal and other factors 
because these estimates are necessarily subjective  our actual payments in the future may vary from those listed in this table 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations licensing agreement obligations notes payable   total commitments we lease our facilities under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  consulting contracts  equipment maintenance  and other significant purchase commitments 
we have entered into certain license agreements that require us to make minimum royalty payments for the life of the licensed patents 
the life of the patents which may be issued and covered by the license agreements cannot be determined at this time  but the minimum royalties due under such agreements are as noted for through and are approximately  per year

 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
among other provisions  the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight and re handling costs must be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal as stated in arb no 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of  beginning on january  we do not expect sfas to have a material financial statement impact 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for non monetary transactions  and replaces it with the exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning on january  we do not expect it to have a material financial statement impact 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r were originally effective for all reporting periods beginning after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see stock based compensation above for the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 providing supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
in april  the sec approved a rule that delayed the effective date of sfas r to the first annual reporting period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas r and sab no 
is expected to result in a material increase in expense in based on unvested options outstanding as of december  and current compensation plans 
sfas r will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter of in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle  and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
at december   we had million invested in interest bearing operating accounts 
while a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates by percent from the december  levels would cause a decrease in interest income  it would not result in a loss of the principal 
additionally  the decrease in interest income would not be material
