item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive summary our revenues declined million compared to revenues from our radio business declined in compared to was our first full year of our less is more initiative in which we reduced the number of commercial minutes broadcast on our radio stations 
the lower number of commercial minutes broadcast resulted in lower radio revenues in compared to  which was partially offset by improved yield  or revenue per commercial  on our radio advertisements in over partially offsetting this decline was revenue growth in our outdoor segments  which combined delivered revenue growth over from the americas  we experienced improved pricing on our outdoor inventory during and internationally  our street furniture inventory experienced improved yields as well 
additionally  we completed the initial public offering of of our outdoor business 
lastly  we completed the spin off of our live entertainment and sports representation businesses during the fourth quarter of  which was part of our strategic realignment of our businesses that we announced in the second quarter of strategic realignment of businesses on april   we announced a plan to strategically realign our businesses 
the plan included an initial public offering ipo of approximately of the common stock of our outdoor segment  which trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cco and a spin off of our live entertainment segment and sports representation business  which now operates under the name live nation and trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol lyv 
we completed the ipo on november  and the spin off on december  the ipo consisted of the sale of million shares of class a common stock of our indirect  wholly owned subsidiary  clear channel outdoor holdings  inc cco 
after completion of the ipo  we own all million shares of cco s outstanding class b common stock  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of cco s common stock and approximately of the total voting power of cco s common stock 
the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  were approximately million 
all of the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balances of intercompany notes owed to us by cco 
the spin off consisted of a dividend of 
share of live nation common stock for each share of our common stock held on december   the date of the distribution 
additionally  live nation repaid approximately million of intercompany notes owed to us by live nation 
we do not own any shares of live nation common stock 
our board of directors determined that the spin off was in the best interests of our shareholders because i it would enhance the success of both us and live nation by enabling each to resolve management and systemic problems that arose by the operation of the businesses within a single affiliated group  ii it would improve the competitiveness of our business by resolving inherent conflicts and the appearance of such conflicts with artists and promoters  iii it would simplify and reduce our and live nation s regulatory burdens and risks  iv it would enhance the ability of us and live nation to issue equity efficiently and effectively for acquisitions and financings  and v it would enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our and live nation s equity based compensation 
operating results of live nation through december  are reported in discontinued operations for all years presented 
after the date of the spin off  live nation is an independent company 
on august   we announced our intention to return approximately billion of capital to shareholders through either share repurchases  a special dividend or a combination of both 
since announcing our intent through march   we have returned approximately million to shareholders by repurchasing million shares of our common stock 
since announcing a share repurchase program in march  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately billion 
subject to our financial condition  market conditions  economic conditions and other factors  it remains our intention to return the remaining balance of the approximately billion in capital to our shareholders through either share repurchases  a special dividend or a combination of both 
we intend to fund any share repurchases and or a special dividend from funds generated from the repayment of intercompany debt  the proceeds of any new debt offerings  available cash balances and cash flow from operations 
the timing and amount of a special dividend  if any  is in the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on the factors described above 
format of presentation management s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
our discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
our reportable operating segments are radio broadcasting  which includes our national syndication business  americas outdoor advertising and international outdoor advertising 
included in the other segment are television broadcasting and our media representation business  katz media 

table of contents we manage our operating segments primarily focusing on their operating income  while corporate expenses  gain on disposition of assets net  interest expense  gain loss on marketable securities  equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates  other income expense net  income tax benefit expense  minority interest net of tax  discontinued operations and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle are managed on a total company basis and are  therefore  included only in our discussion of consolidated results 
radio broadcasting our local radio markets are run predominantly by local management teams who control the formats selected for their programming 
the formats are designed to reach audiences with targeted demographic characteristics that appeal to our advertisers 
our advertising rates are principally based on how many people in a targeted audience listen to our stations  as measured by an independent ratings service 
the size of the market influences rates as well  with larger markets typically receiving higher rates than smaller markets 
also  our advertising rates are influenced by the time of day the advertisement airs  with morning and evening drive time hours typically the highest 
radio advertising contracts are typically less than one year 
during the first quarter of  we completed the rollout of our less is more initiative  which lowered the amount of commercial minutes played per hour by approximately across our stations 
we believe lowering the amount of commercial minutes can improve our ratings  which will lead to an increase in the size of the audience listening to our stations 
another key component of less is more is encouraging advertisers to invest in shorter advertisements rather than the traditional second spot 
based on our research  we believe that the effectiveness of a commercial is not related to its length 
because effectiveness is not tied to the length of the advertisement  on a cost per thousand listeners reached basis  we believe we can provide our advertisers a more efficient investment with our new shorter commercials than with the traditional second commercials 
management monitors macro level indicators to assess our radio operations performance 
due to the geographic diversity and autonomy of our markets  we have a multitude of market specific advertising rates and audience demographics 
therefore  our discussion of the results of operations of our radio broadcasting segment focuses on the macro level indicators that management monitors to assess our radio segment s financial condition and results of operations 
management looks at our radio operations overall revenues as well as local advertising  which is sold predominately in a station s local market  and national advertising  which is sold across multiple markets 
local advertising is sold by our local radio stations sales staffs while national advertising is sold  for the most part  through our national representation firm 
local advertising  which is our largest source of advertising revenue  and national advertising revenues are tracked separately  because these revenue streams have different sales forces and respond differently to changes in the economic environment 
management also looks at radio revenue by market size  as defined by arbitron 
typically  larger markets can reach larger audiences with wider demographics than smaller markets 
over half of our radio revenue and divisional operating expenses comes from our largest markets 
additionally  management reviews our share of target demographics listening to the radio in an average quarter hour 
this metric gauges how well our formats are attracting and keeping listeners 
a significant portion of our radio segment s expenses vary in connection with changes in revenue 
these variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our sales department  such as salaries  commissions and bad debt 
our programming and general and administrative departments incur most of our fixed costs  such as talent costs  rights fees  utilities and office salaries 
lastly  our highly discretionary costs are in our marketing and promotions department  which we primarily incur to maintain and or increase our audience share 
outdoor advertising our revenues are derived from selling advertising space on the displays that we own or operate in key markets worldwide  consisting primarily of billboards  street furniture displays and transit displays 
we own the majority of our advertising displays  which typically are located on sites that we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements 
our advertising contracts with clients typically outline the number of displays reserved  the duration of the advertising campaign and the unit price per display 
the margins on our billboard contracts tend to be higher than those on contracts for our other displays 
generally  our advertising rates are based on the gross rating points  or total number of impressions delivered expressed as a percentage of a market population  of a display or group of displays 
the number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time and  in some 
table of contents international markets  is weighted to account for such factors as illumination  proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic 
to monitor our business  management typically reviews the average rates  average revenues per display  occupancy  and inventory levels of each of our display types by market 
in addition  because a significant portion of our advertising operations are conducted in foreign markets  principally france and the united kingdom  management reviews the operating results from our foreign operations on a constant dollar basis 
a constant dollar basis allows for comparison of operations independent of foreign exchange movements 
because revenue sharing and minimum guaranteed payment arrangements are more prevalent in our international operations  the margins in our international operations typically are less than the margins in our americas operations 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses  as well as gains and losses from translation of financial statements of subsidiaries and investees in highly inflationary countries  are included in operations 
the significant expenses associated with our operations include i direct production  maintenance and installation expenses  ii site lease expenses for land under our displays and iii revenue sharing or minimum guaranteed amounts payable under our street furniture and transit display contracts 
our direct production  maintenance and installation expenses include costs for printing  transporting and changing the advertising copy on our displays  the related labor costs  the vinyl and paper costs and the costs for cleaning and maintaining our displays 
vinyl and paper costs vary according to the complexity of the advertising copy and the quantity of displays 
our site lease expenses include lease payments for use of the land under our displays  as well as any revenue sharing arrangements we may have with the landlords 
the terms of our americas site leases generally range from to years 
internationally  the terms of our site leases generally range from to years  but may vary across our networks

discontinued operations we completed the spin off of live nation on december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we reported the results of operations of these businesses during  and in discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of operations and reclassified cash flows from these businesses to discontinued operations on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
included in discontinued operations on our statements of cash flows for is approximately million from the repayment of intercompany notes owed to us by live nation 
anticipated cash requirements we expect to fund anticipated cash requirements including payments of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and commitments  acquisitions  anticipated capital expenditures  share repurchases and dividends for the foreseeable future with cash flows from operations and various externally generated funds 

table of contents sources of capital as of december  and  we had the following debt outstanding and cash and cash equivalents in millions december  credit facilities long term bonds a other borrowings total debt less cash and cash equivalents a includes million and million in unamortized fair value purchase accounting adjustment premiums related to the merger with amfm at december  and  respectively 
also includes a negative million adjustment and a positive million adjustment related to fair value adjustments for interest rate swap agreements at december  and  respectively 
credit facility we have a multi currency revolving credit facility in the amount of billion  which can be used for general working capital purposes including commercial paper support as well as to fund capital expenditures  share repurchases  acquisitions and the refinancing of public debt securities 
at december   the outstanding balance on this facility was million and  taking into account letters of credit of million  billion was available for future borrowings  with the entire balance to be repaid on july  during the year ended december   we made principal payments totaling billion and drew down billion on the credit facility 
as of march   the credit facility s outstanding balance was billion and  taking into account outstanding letters of credit  million was available for future borrowings 
long term bonds on july   our eurobonds matured  which we redeemed for million plus accrued interest through borrowings under our credit facility 
these bonds were designated as a hedge of our euro denominated net assets 
to replace this hedge  on july   we entered into a united states dollar euro cross currency swap with a euro notional amount of million and a corresponding us dollar notional amount of million 
the cross currency swap requires the company to make fixed cash payments of on the euro notional amount while it receives fixed cash payments of on the equivalent us dollar notional amount  all on a semiannual basis 
the company designated the cross currency swap as a hedge of its net investment in euro denominated assets 
other borrowings other debt includes various borrowings and capital leases utilized for general operating purposes 
included in the million balance at december  is million that matures in less than one year  which we have historically refinanced with new twelve month notes and anticipate these refinancings to continue 
guarantees of third party obligations as of december  and  we guaranteed the debt of third parties of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily related to long term operating contracts 
the third parties associated operating assets secure a substantial portion of these obligations 
disposal of assets during  we received million of proceeds related primarily to the sale of various broadcasting operating assets 
shelf registration on april   we filed a registration statement on form s covering a combined billion of debt securities  junior subordinated debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  warrants  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 
the shelf registration statement also covers preferred securities that may be issued from time to time by our three delaware statutory business trusts and guarantees of such preferred securities by us 
the sec declared this shelf registration statement effective on april  after debt offerings on september   
table of contents november   and december   billion in securities remains available for issuance under this shelf registration statement 
debt covenants the significant covenants on our billion five year  multi currency revolving credit facility relate to leverage and interest coverage contained and defined in the credit agreement 
the leverage ratio covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to operating cash flow as defined by the credit agreement of less than x 
the interest coverage covenant requires us to maintain a minimum ratio of operating cash flow as defined by the credit agreement to interest expense of x 
in the event that we do not meet these covenants  we are considered to be in default on the credit facility at which time the credit facility may become immediately due 
at december   our leverage and interest coverage ratios were x and x  respectively 
this credit facility contains a cross default provision that would be triggered if we were to default on any other indebtedness greater than million 
our other indebtedness does not contain provisions that would make it a default if we were to default on our credit facility 
the fees we pay on our billion  five year multi currency revolving credit facility depend on our long term debt ratings 
based on our current ratings level of bbb baa  our fees on borrowings are a basis point spread to libor and are basis points on the total billion facility 
in the event our ratings improve  the fee on borrowings and facility fee decline gradually to basis points and basis points  respectively  at ratings of a a or better 
in the event that our ratings decline  the fee on borrowings and facility fee increase gradually to basis points and basis points  respectively  at ratings of bb ba or lower 
we believe there are no other agreements that contain provisions that trigger an event of default upon a change in long term debt ratings that would have a material impact to our financial statements 
additionally  our senior notes due  which were originally issued by amfm operating inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of clear channel  contain certain restrictive covenants that limit the ability of amfm operating inc to incur additional indebtedness  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends  consolidate  or effect certain asset sales 
at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance throughout uses of capital dividends our board of directors declared quarterly cash dividends as follows in millions  except per share data amount per declaration common total date share record date payment date payment october  december  january  february  march  april  april  june  july  july  september  october  october  december  january  additionally  on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of our common stock to be paid on april   to shareholders of record on march  acquisitions during we acquired radio stations for million in cash 
we also acquired americas outdoor display faces for million in cash 
our international outdoor segment acquired display faces for million and a controlling majority interest in clear media limited for million 
clear media is a chinese outdoor advertising company and as a result of consolidating its operations during the third quarter of  the acquisition resulted in an 
table of contents increase to our cash of million 
also  our national representation business acquired new contracts for a total of million and the company s television business acquired a television station for million 
capital expenditures in millions year ended december  capital expenditures americas international corporate and radio outdoor outdoor other total non revenue producing revenue producing we define non revenue producing capital expenditures as those expenditures that are required on a recurring basis 
revenue producing capital expenditures are discretionary capital investments for new revenue streams  similar to an acquisition 
company share repurchase program our board of directors approved two separate share repurchase programs during  each for billion 
on february   our board of directors approved a third billion share repurchase program 
on august   our board of directors authorized an increase in and extension of the february program  which had million remaining  by million  for a total of billion 
this increase expires on august   although the program may be discontinued or suspended at anytime prior to its expiration 
during we repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of billion  including commission and fees  under these programs 
as of march   million shares had been repurchased for an aggregate purchase price of billion  including commission and fees  under the share repurchase programs  with remaining available 
on march   our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program  permitting us to repurchase an additional million of our common stock 
this increase expires on march   although the program may be discontinued or suspended at any time 
commitments  contingencies and future obligations commitments and contingencies there are various lawsuits and claims pending against us 
we believe that any ultimate liability resulting from those actions or claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
although we have recorded accruals based on our current assumptions of the future liability for these lawsuits  it is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
see also item legal proceedings and note i commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item included elsewhere in this report 
certain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five year period 
we will continue to accrue additional amounts related to such contingent payments if and when it is determinable that the applicable financial performance targets will be met 
the aggregate of these contingent payments  if performance targets are met  would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations 
future obligations in addition to our scheduled maturities on our debt  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space  certain broadcast facilities  equipment and the majority of the land occupied by our outdoor advertising structures under long term operating leases 
some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses generally tied to the consumer price index  as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance 
we have minimum franchise payments associated with non cancelable contracts that enable us to display advertising on such media as buses  taxis  trains  bus shelters and terminals 
the majority of these contracts contain rent provisions that are calculated as the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenue or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment 
also  we have non cancelable contracts in our radio broadcasting operations related to program rights and music license fees 
in the normal course of business  our broadcasting operations have minimum future payments associated with employee and talent contracts 
these contracts typically contain cancellation provisions that allow us to cancel the contract with good cause 

table of contents the scheduled maturities of our credit facility  other long term debt outstanding  future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable lease agreements  minimum payments under other non cancelable contracts  payments under employment talent contracts  capital expenditure commitments  and other long term obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands payment due by period less than to more than contractual obligations total year years to years years long term debt credit facility other long term debt interest payments on long term debt non cancelable operating leases non cancelable contracts employment talent contracts capital expenditures other long term obligations total other long term obligations consist of million related to asset retirement obligations recorded pursuant to financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which assumes the underlying assets will be removed at some period over the next years 
also included is million related to the maturity value of loans secured by forward exchange contracts that we accrete to maturity using the effective interest method and can be settled in cash or the underlying shares 
these contracts had an accreted value of million and the underlying shares had a fair value of million recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at december  also included in the table is million related to deferred compensation and retirement plans 
excluded from the table is million related to the fair value of interest rate swap agreements  cross currency swap agreements  and secured forward exchange contracts 
also excluded is million related to various obligations with no specific contractual commitment or maturity 
market risk interest rate risk at december   approximately of our long term debt  including fixed rate debt on which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a two percentage point change in the year s average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have changed by million and that our net income would have changed by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
at december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements with a billion aggregate notional amount that effectively float interest at rates based upon libor 
these agreements expire from february to march the fair value of these agreements at december  was a liability of million 
equity price risk the carrying value of our available for sale and trading equity securities is affected by changes in their quoted market prices 
it is estimated that a change in the market prices of these securities would change their carrying value at december  by million and would change accumulated comprehensive income loss and net income by million and million  respectively 
at december   we also held million of investments that do not have a quoted market price  but are subject to fluctuations in their value 
we maintain derivative instruments on certain of our available for sale and trading equity securities to limit our exposure to and benefit from price fluctuations on those securities 

table of contents foreign currency we have operations in countries throughout the world 
foreign operations are measured in their local currencies except in hyper inflationary countries in which we operate 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have operations 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure of international currency fluctuations  we maintain a natural hedge through borrowings in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  we have us dollar euro cross currency swaps which are also designated as a hedge of our net investment in euro denominated assets 
these hedge positions are reviewed monthly 
our foreign operations reported a net loss of million for the year ended december  it is estimated that a change in the value of the us dollar to foreign currencies would change net income for the year ended december  by million 
our earnings are also affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of our investments in various countries  all of which are accounted for under the equity method 
it is estimated that the result of a fluctuation in the value of the dollar relative to these foreign currencies at december  would change our equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates by million and would change our net income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
this analysis does not consider the implications that such fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the us or the foreign countries or on the results of operations of these foreign entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement  asset retirement obligations  which was issued in june according to fin  uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement because they are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity should be factored into the measurement of the asset retirement obligation when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  retrospective application of interim financial information is permitted  but is not required 
we adopted fin on january   which did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
share based payment sab 
sab expresses the sec staff s views regarding the interaction between statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment statement r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in particular  sab provides guidance related to share based payment transactions with nonemployees  the transition from nonpublic to public entity status  valuation methods including assumptions such as expected volatility and expected term  the accounting for certain redeemable financial instruments issued under share based payment arrangements  the classification of compensation expense  non gaap financial measures  first time adoption of statement r in an interim period  capitalization of compensation cost related to share based payment arrangements  the accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements upon adoption of statement r and the modification of employee share options prior to adoption of statement r 
in april  the sec issued a press release announcing that it would provide for phased in implementation guidance for statement r 
the sec would require that registrants that are not small business issuers adopt statement r s fair value method of accounting for share based payments to employees no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  we will adopt statement r on january  we expect the impact of adopting sab and statement r to be in the range of million to million recorded as a component of operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in may   the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections statement 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt statement on january  and anticipate that adoption will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  determining the amortization period of leasehold improvements eitf 
eitf requires that assets recognized under capital leases generally be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee s normal depreciation policy except that the amortization period is limited to the lease term which includes renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
eitf also addresses the determination of the amortization period for leasehold improvements that are purchased subsequent to the inception of the lease 
leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of the lease should be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term that includes reasonably assured lease renewals as determined on the date of the acquisition of the leasehold improvement 
we adopted eitf on july  which did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued staff position fsp 
fsp requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense 
the guidance in fsp shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after december  we will adopt fsp january  and do not anticipate adoption to materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb staff issued fasb staff position fas fas 
fas replaces the impairment evaluation guidance paragraphs of eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf  with references to the existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
eitf disclosure requirements remain in effect  and are applicable for year end reporting and for interim periods if there are significant changes from the previous year end 
fas also supersedes eitf topic no 
d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value  and clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell an impaired security has not been made 
the guidance in fas is to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we will adopt fas january  and anticipate adoption will not materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such difference could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note a  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of this annual report on form k 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditor and the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following narrative describes these critical accounting estimates  the judgments and assumptions and the effect if actual results differ from these assumptions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debt based on historical experience of bad debts as a percent of revenues for each business unit  adjusted for relative improvements or deteriorations in the agings and changes in current economic conditions 
if our agings were to improve or deteriorate resulting in a change in our allowance  it is estimated that our bad debt expense would have changed by million and our net income would have changed by million 

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that depreciable and amortizable long lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
when specific assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the cost basis of the asset is reduced to reflect the current fair market value 
we use various assumptions in determining the current fair market value of these assets  including future expected cash flows and discount rates  as well as future salvage values 
our impairment loss calculations require management to apply judgment in estimating future cash flows  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
using the impairment review described  we found no impairment charge required for the year ended december  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
we review goodwill for potential impairment annually using the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
the fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit 
to the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value  an impairment charge may be required to be recorded 
the income approach we use for valuing goodwill involves estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets  discounted to their present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
terminal values were also estimated and discounted to their present value 
in accordance with statement  we performed our annual impairment tests as of october   and on goodwill 
no impairment charges resulted from these tests 
we may incur additional impairment charges in future periods under statement to the extent we do not achieve our expected cash flow growth rates  and to the extent that market values and long term interest rates in general decrease and increase  respectively indefinite lived assets indefinite lived assets such as fcc licenses are reviewed annually for possible impairment using the direct method 
under the direct method  it is assumed that rather than acquiring a radio station as a going concern business  the buyer hypothetically obtains a fcc license and builds a new station or operation with similar attributes from scratch 
thus  the buyer incurs start up costs during the build up phase which are normally associated with going concern value 
initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flow model which results in value that is directly attributable to the fcc license 
the purchase price is then allocated between tangible and identified intangible assets including the fcc license  and any residual is allocated to goodwill 
our key assumptions using the direct method are market revenue growth rates  market share  profit margin  duration and profile of the build up period  estimated start up capital costs and losses incurred during the build up period  the risk adjusted discount rate and terminal values 
this data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average station within a market 
the sec staff issued staff announcement no 
d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  at the september meeting of the emerging issues task force 
d states that the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill 
prior to adoption of d  the company recorded its acquisition of radio and television stations and outdoor permits at fair value using an industry accepted income approach and consequently applied the same approach for purposes of impairment testing 
our adoption of the direct method resulted in an aggregate fair value of our radio and television fcc licenses and outdoor permits that was less than the carrying value determined under our prior method 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of billion  net of deferred taxes of billion as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the fourth quarter of if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future 
if our assumption on market revenue growth rate decreased  our non cash charge  net of tax  would increase million 
similarly  if our assumption on market revenue growth rate increased  our non cash charge  net of tax  would decrease million 
our annual impairment test was performed as of october   which resulted in no impairment 

table of contents tax accruals the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities routinely examine our tax returns 
from time to time  the irs challenges certain of our tax positions 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the irs could require us to make additional tax payments 
we believe that we have adequately accrued for any foreseeable payments resulting from tax examinations and consequently do not anticipate any material impact upon their ultimate resolution 
the estimate of our tax accruals contains uncertainty because management uses judgment to estimate the exposure associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent there are changes in the expected outcome of tax examinations  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
litigation accruals we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
management s estimates used have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
insurance accruals we are currently self insured beyond certain retention amounts for various insurance coverages  including general liability and property and casualty 
accruals are recorded based on estimates of actual claims filed  historical payouts  existing insurance coverage and projections of future development of costs related to existing claims 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of december  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at december   would have affected net earnings by approximately million for the year ended december  inflation inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for wages  salaries and equipment 
although the exact impact of inflation is indeterminable  we believe we have offset these higher costs by increasing the effective advertising rates of most of our broadcasting stations and outdoor display faces 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the ratio of earnings to fixed charges is as follows year ended december  for the year ended december   fixed charges exceeded earnings before income taxes and fixed charges by billion 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a total enterprise basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations before income taxes less equity in undistributed net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates plus fixed charges 
fixed charges represent interest  amortization of debt discount and expense  and the estimated interest portion of rental charges 
we had no preferred stock outstanding for any period presented
