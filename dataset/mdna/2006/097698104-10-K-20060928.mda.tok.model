overview sales of the company s geophysical products are generally related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity  which is dependent  primarily  on oil and gas prices 
after an industry wide slowdown in marine seismic activity in fiscal  marine seismic exploration activity started to improve during fiscal  and this improvement has continued throughout fiscal and fiscal the high price of oil  increased worldwide energy demand and the depletion of proven oil and natural gas reserves have contributed to an increased demand for marine seismic surveys 
as a result  the company s geophysical equipment sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as customer orders increased substantially for complete energy source systems  replacement parts for energy source systems  ssms and underwater electrical connectors and cables 
the company believes that the oil services industry will continue to show increased activity in fiscal based on several factors  including the company expects seismic vessel demand to exceed supply in calendar year and beyond  and expects increased demand to resurvey tracts using improved technology to obtain better seismic data and or to survey new areas in deeper waters 
sales in the industrial products segment decreased by for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  with continuing improvement in the us economy  the company anticipates that industrial products sales should increase in fiscal due primarily to the increase in the geophysical equipment business as described above  the company s balance sheet continued to strengthen during fiscal working capital at june  was million  an increase of from the amount at june  liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company believes that current cash and cash equivalent balances and projected cash flow from operations are adequate to meet foreseeable operating needs in fiscal year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents

for fiscal  the company used  for capital expenditures funded from operating cash flow which relate to new and replacement equipment 
of this amount  approximately  relates to the purchase of new machines for the geophysical equipment segment 
the company estimates that capital expenditures for fiscal will approximate  which will be funded from operating cash flow 
these anticipated capital expenditures will relate primarily to new and replacement production machinery 
since a relatively small number of customers account for the majority of the company s geophysical segment 
table of contents sales  the consolidated accounts receivable balance at the end of any period tends to be concentrated in a small number of customers 
at june  and june   the five customers with the highest accounts receivable balances represented and  respectively  of the consolidated accounts receivable balances on those dates

higher sales in the geophysical equipment business reflect the continuing strength in marine seismic activity 
industrial products sales for the year ended june  decreased by  or compared to the year ended june  the fiscal sales decrease reflects lower electric motor sales

the adverse effect on the cost of sales percentage for geophysical equipment was offset by these price increases  resulting in an unchanged cost of sales percentage

the company implemented a price increase for industrial products effective april  research and development costs for the year ended june  increased by  or from the year ended june  the reasons for this increase relate to further improvements to the apg guns and ssms 
ssms is utilized to measure air gun depth  air pressure  near field energy output for each gun array and to provide high pressure air flow control  thereby enhancing the accuracy and therefore the usefulness of marine seismic survey data 
the company continues working on more advanced stages of ssms that will deliver further benefits to customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended june  from the year ended june  primarily due to higher compensation expense 
the increase in compensation expense relates primarily to higher incentive compensation

higher sales in the geophysical equipment business reflect the increase in marine seismic activity in fiscal industrial products sales for the year ended june  increased by  or compared to the year ended june   reflecting higher volume associated with improvement in the domestic economy 
consolidated cost of sales as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the year ended june  versus for the year ended june  cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the geophysical segment decreased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june   due primarily to higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase  a smaller addition to the inventory valuation reserve in fiscal and the implementation of a price increase in january cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the industrial products segment was for the year ended june   unchanged from the year ended june  although manufacturing costs increased in the industrial products segment  such increase was offset by a price increase effective january and higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the sales increase in fiscal research and development costs for the year ended june  increased by  or from the year ended june  the major portion of the research and development cost increase relates to the company s ssms

the above mentioned factors resulted in a net income for the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying the accounting policies most critical to its financial statements have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  the company s most critical policies include revenue recognition  recording of inventory reserves  deferred taxes  and the potential impairment of goodwill 
these policies are discussed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies  including the establishment of bad debt reserves 
the company believes that these other policies either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or that it is less likely that they would have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
although the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  these are based on information available at the end of each reporting period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and its estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales revenue when it is realized and earned 
the company s reported sales revenue is based on meeting the following criteria manufacturing products based on customer specifications 
delivering product to the customer before the close of the reporting period  whereby delivery results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer 
establishing a set sales price with the customer 
collecting the sales revenue from the customer is reasonably assured 
no significant contingencies exist 
inventory reserves a significant source of the company s revenue arises from the sale of replacement parts required by customers who have previously purchased products 
as a result  the company maintains a large quantity of parts on hand 
table of contents that may not be sold or used in final assemblies for an extended period of time 
in order to recognize that certain inventory may become obsolete or have supplies in excess of reasonably supportable sales forecasts  an inventory valuation reserve has been established 
the inventory valuation reserve is a significant estimate made by management 
actual results may differ from this estimate  and the difference could be material 
management establishes the inventory valuation reserve by reviewing the inventory for items that should be reserved in full based on a lack of usage for a specified period of time and for which future demand is not forecasted and establishes an additional reserve for slow moving inventory based on varying percentages of the cost of the items 
at june  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the raw materials and sub assemblies inventory were considered slow moving and subject to a reserve provision equal to all or a portion of the cost  less an estimate for scrap value 
in certain instances  this inventory has been unsold for more than five years from date of manufacture or purchase  and in other instances the company has more than a five year supply of inventory on hand based on recent sales volume 
at june   the cost of inventory which has more than a five year supply on hand and the cost of inventory which has had no sales during the last five years amounted to approximately  management believes that this inventory is properly valued and appropriately reserved 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  that would not result in a current cash charge since the cash required to manufacture or purchase the older inventory was expended in prior years 
the inventory valuation reserve is adjusted at the close of each accounting period  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the valuation reserve required 
this estimate is calculated on a consistent basis as determined by the company s inventory valuation policy 
increases to the inventory valuation reserve result in a charge to cost of sales  and decreases to the reserve result in a credit to cost of sales 
the inventory valuation reserve is also decreased when items are scrapped or disposed of 
during the fiscal year ended june   the inventory valuation reserve was increased by  and disposals totaled  deferred taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
the company reviews its internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make its assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment changes  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has concluded that no deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at june  and june  because future taxable income is believed to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset 
net deferred tax accounts decreased by  from a net deferred asset of  at june  to a net deferred liability of  at june   reflecting principally the utilization of the alternative minimum tax credit carry forward  amortization of goodwill for tax purposes  and reduction of the inventory valuation reserve 
goodwill impairment testing as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
goodwill was tested for impairment as of july  and and the tests indicated no impairment 
the tests were conducted by management with the assistance of an independent valuation company 
the company s goodwill carrying amounts relate solely to the acquisition of custom products and a g  which are two sfas no 
reporting units 
bolt  the parent of custom products and a g  is a third reporting unit and has no goodwill 
both bolt and a g are in the geophysical equipment segment  and custom products is in the industrial products segment 

table of contents goodwill represents approximately of the company s total assets at june  and is thus a significant estimate by management 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  that would not result in a current cash charge because the company s goodwill amounts reflected on its balance sheet arose out of acquisition accounting several years ago
