results of operations overview the company develops  manufactures  distributes and markets specialty performance ingredients and products for the food  pharmaceutical  feed and medical sterilization industries 
the company s reportable segments are strategic businesses that offer products and services to different markets 
the company presently has three reportable segments specialty products  encapsulated nutritional products  and bcp ingredients 
specialty products the specialty products segment repackages and distributes the following specialty gases ethylene oxide  blends of ethylene oxide  propylene oxide and methyl chloride 
ethylene oxide  at the level  is sold as a chemical sterilant gas  primarily for use in the health care industry and is used to sterilize medical devices 
contract sterilizers  medical device manufacturers and medical gas distributors are the company s principal customers for this product 
blends of ethylene oxide are sold as fumigants and are highly effective in killing bacteria  fungi  and insects in spices and other seasoning type materials 
in addition  the company also sells single use canisters with ethylene oxide for use in medical device sterilization 
propylene oxide and methyl chloride are sold principally to customers seeking smaller as opposed to bulk quantities 
management believes that future success in this segment is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent quality  safety and customer service 
encapsulated nutritional products the encapsulated nutritional products segment provides microencapsulation and agglomeration solutions to a variety of applications in food  pharmaceutical and nutritional ingredients to enhance performance of nutritional fortification  processing  mixing  packaging applications and shelf life 
major end product applications are baked goods  refrigerated and frozen dough systems  processed meats  seasoning blends  confections  nutritional supplementations and animal nutrition 
we also market human grade choline nutrient products through this industry segment for wellness applications 
choline is recognized to play a key role in the structural integrity of cell membranes  processing dietary fat  reproductive development and neural functions  such as memory and muscle function 
balchem s portfolio of granulated calcium carbonate products are primarily used in novel over the counter and prescription pharmaceuticals for the treatment of osteoporosis  gastric disorders and calcium deficiencies in the united states 
management believes this segment s key strengths are its proprietary technology and end product application capabilities 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue in this segment is highly dependent on the timing of marketing launches of new products in the us and international food and nutrition markets by the company s customers and prospects 
the company  through its innovative proprietary technology and applications expertise  continues to develop new products designed to solve and respond to customer problems and needs 
sales of products for the animal nutrition and health industry are highly dependent on dairy industry economics as well as the ability of the company to leverage the results of existing successful university research on the animal health benefits of the company s products 
bcp ingredients bcp ingredients manufactures and supplies choline chloride  an essential nutrient for animal health  to the poultry and swine industries 
in addition  certain derivatives of choline chloride are also marketed into industrial applications 
management believes that success in this commodity oriented marketplace is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent product quality and customer service 
in addition  the company must continue to increase production efficiencies in order to maintain its low cost position to effectively compete for market share in a highly competitive marketplace 
the company sells products for all three segments through its own sales force  independent distributors  and sales agents

critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following policies to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon product shipment  passage of title and risk of loss  and when collection is reasonably assured 
the company reports amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities 
in addition  the company follows the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
revenue related to a process and product license agreement is recognized using the percentage of completion method and the progress to completion is measured using the efforts expended method 
the company follows the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue is recognized as work is performed and costs are incurred 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess or obsolete inventories 
inventory reserves are generally recorded when the inventory for a product exceeds twelve months of demand for that product and or when individual products have been in inventory for greater than six months 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if an indicator of impairment exists  the company determines the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of its goodwill to its carrying value 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  europe  mexico and japan 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
post employment benefits the company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions as to general economic conditions and health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduced a plan sponsor subsidy based on a percentage of a beneficiary s annual prescription drug benefits  within defined limits  and the opportunity for a retiree to obtain prescription drug benefits under medicare 
there was no impact of the subsidy on the postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic cost in or as medicare eligible retirees are not covered under the company s plan 
intangible assets with finite lives the useful life of an intangible asset is based on the company s assumptions regarding expected use of the asset  the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset s useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed  it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  shared based payment which supersedes accounting principle board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
the requirements of sfas r are effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company will be required to adopt the provisions of sfas r as of january  under fas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost  and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the permitted transition methods include either modified retrospective or modified prospective adoption 
under the modified retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas r  while the modified retrospective methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options beginning with the first period presented 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
adoption of sfas r will have no impact on the historical financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would not have been materially different from the impact of sfas no 
r as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market accounts 
accordingly  we believe we have limited exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
however  interest payable under the company s term loan and credit line is based on libor plus  and thus exposes the company to some interest rate risk in connection with its bank financing 
the company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments  nor does the company have any financial instruments entered into for trading or hedging purposes 
foreign sales are generally billed in us dollars 
the company believes that its business operations are not exposed in any material respect to market risk relating to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk
