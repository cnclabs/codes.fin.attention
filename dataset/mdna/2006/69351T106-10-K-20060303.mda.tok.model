item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ppl is an energy and utility holding company with headquarters in allentown  pa 
see item business background  for descriptions of ppl s reportable segments  which are supply  international delivery and pennsylvania delivery 
see exhibit a in item for a listing of the current corporate organization 
through its subsidiaries  ppl is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets the northeastern and western us and in the delivery of electricity in pennsylvania  the uk and latin america 
ppl s overall strategy is to achieve disciplined growth in energy supply margins while limiting volatility in both cash flows and earnings and to achieve stable  long term growth in regulated delivery businesses through efficient operations and strong customer and regulatory relations 
more specifically  ppl s strategy for its electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply with load  or customer demand  under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing exposure to movements in energy and fuel prices and counterparty credit risk 
ppl s strategy for its electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate these businesses at the most efficient cost while maintaining the highest level of customer service and reliability 
ppl faces several risks in its generation business 
the principal risks are electricity wholesale price risk  fuel supply and price risk  power plant performance and counterparty credit risk 
ppl attempts to manage these risks through various means 
for instance  ppl operates a portfolio of generation assets that is diversified as to geography  fuel source  cost structure and operating characteristics 
ppl is focused on the operating efficiency of these power plants and maintaining their availability 
in addition  ppl has in place and continues to pursue contracts of varying lengths for energy sales and fuel supply  and other means  to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes in the difference  or margin  between the cost to produce electricity and the price at which ppl sells it 
whether ppl decides to  or is able to  continue to enter into long term or intermediate term power sales and fuel purchase agreements or renew its existing agreements and the market conditions at that time will affect its future profitability 
currently  ppl s commitments for energy sales are substantially satisfied through its own generation assets ie  ppl primarily markets and trades around its physical portfolio of generating assets through integrated generation  marketing and trading functions 
ppl has in place risk management programs that  among other things  are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of earnings and cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  counterparty credit quality and the operational performance of its generating units 
ppl s electricity delivery businesses are rate regulated 
accordingly  these businesses are subject to regulatory risk in terms of the costs that they may recover and the investment returns that they may collect in customer rates 
the principal challenge that ppl faces in its electricity delivery businesses is to maintain high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost effective manner 
ppl faces additional financial risks in conducting international operations  such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
ppl attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management programs 
a key challenge for ppl s business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile 
investors  analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry continue to be focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of these companies 
ppl continually focuses on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position  thereby improving its credit profile 
see item a 
risk factors for more information concerning the material risks that ppl faces in its businesses 
the purpose of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is to provide information concerning ppl s past and expected future performance in implementing the strategies and managing the risks and challenges mentioned above 
specifically results of operations provides an overview of ppl s operating results in and  including a review of earnings  with details of results by reportable segment

this subsection also includes a listing and discussion of ppl s current credit ratings 
financial condition risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other provides an explanation of ppl s risk management programs relating to market risk and credit risk 
application of critical accounting policies provides an overview of the accounting policies that are particularly important to the results of operations and financial condition of ppl and that require its management to make significant estimates  assumptions and other judgments 
although ppl s management believes that these estimates  assumptions and other judgments are appropriate  they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  changes in the estimates  assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on ppl s results of operations and financial condition as reflected in ppl s financial statements

higher operation and maintenance expenses in compared with were primarily due to more planned power plant outages in higher operation and maintenance expenses in compared with were primarily due to gains in on the settlement of various property and environmental insurance claims and the higher cost of forced outages in at the montour facility 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in lease expense due to the consolidation of the sundance and university park generation facilities in accordance with fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
depreciation expense increased in compared with primarily due to the consolidation of the sundance and university park generation facilities in accordance with fin  and depreciation on the lower mt 
bethel plant  which began commercial operation in may interest expense increased in compared with primarily due to consolidation of the lessors of the sundance  university park and lower mt 
bethel generation facilities  in accordance with fin the improved earnings contribution from synfuel projects for both periods resulted primarily from higher synthetic fuel tax credits due to higher output at the tyrone facility  which went into commercial operation in august also contributing to the synthetic fuel earnings increase were unrealized gains on options purchased to hedge the risk associated with synthetic fuel tax credits for and outlook based on current forward energy prices  ppl is projecting higher energy margins for its supply segment in compared with  primarily driven by the increase in the generation prices under the plr contracts 
higher generation output  higher priced wholesale energy contracts that replace expiring contracts  and lower purchased power costs also are expected to improve energy margins 
these benefits are expected to be partially offset by increased fuel and fuel transportation expenses  higher operation and maintenance expenses and reduced earnings from synfuel projects

pjm billing dispute note acceleration of stock based compensation expense for periods prior to note workforce reduction note total in december  the puc approved an increase in ppl electric s distribution rates of approximately million based on a return on equity of  and approved ppl electric s proposed mechanism for collecting an additional million in transmission related charges  for a total annual increase of approximately million  effective january  delivery revenues also increased in compared with due to a increase in electricity delivery sales volumes 
in january  severe ice storms hit ppl electric s service territory 
as a result  ppl electric had to restore service to approximately  customers 
the total cost of restoring service  excluding capitalized costs and regular payroll expenses  was approximately million or per share 
on february   ppl electric filed a petition with the puc for authority to defer and amortize for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes these storm costs 
on august   the puc issued an order granting ppl electric s petition subject to certain conditions  including i the puc s authorization of deferred accounting is not an assurance of future rate recovery of the storm costs  ii ppl electric must request recovery of the deferred storm costs in its next distribution base rate case  and iii ppl electric must begin immediately to expense the deferred storm costs on a ten year amortization schedule for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes 
as a result of the puc order and in accordance with sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  in the third quarter of  ppl electric deferred approximately million or per share of its previously expensed storm costs 
the deferral was based on its assessment of the timing and likelihood of recovering the deferred costs in ppl electric s next distribution base rate case 
at this time  ppl electric cannot be certain that it will recover the storm costs  nor can it predict whether future incidents of severe weather will cause significant facility damage and service disruptions that would also result in significant costs 
ppl electric recognized an after tax charge of million or per share in the first quarter of for a loss contingency related to the pjm billing dispute 
see note for information concerning the proposed settlement agreement reached by ppl electric and exelon corporation  which is subject to approval by the ferc 
ppl cannot be certain of the outcome of this matter or the impact on ppl and its subsidiaries 
operation and maintenance expense increased in compared with  primarily due to increased system reliability work and tree trimming costs 
operation and maintenance expenses increased in compared with primarily due to the write off of certain hurricane isabel costs not approved for recovery by the puc  and higher pension costs 
outlook ppl projects the pennsylvania delivery segment will have flat delivery revenues in compared with due to projected modest load growth in and because of higher sales in as a result of unusually warm weather

eastern us non trading margins were lower in compared with  primarily due to higher fuel costs 
average coal prices increased by over last year  while average gas and oil prices increased by 
despite record high generation in  the increased use of higher cost oil and gas units to cover retail volumes  which were up over  and generation output lost during coal and nuclear plant outages contributed to lower margins 
due to market price increases and changes in fuel mix  average fuel prices increased over partially offsetting the effects of higher supply costs was a increase in retail energy prices  in accordance with the schedule established by the puc final order 
eastern us non trading margins were higher in compared with  primarily due to higher generation  as well as higher prices and slightly higher sales volumes 
in pjm  where the majority of ppl s eastern wholesale activity occurs  average spot prices rose in over ppl also benefited from favorable transmission congestion positions 
in addition  retail energy prices increased by approximately in in accordance with the schedule established by the puc 
the higher sales volumes reflect the return of customers who had previously shopped for electricity  as well as new load obligations in connecticut and new jersey  partially offset by lower wholesale sales 
partially offsetting these improvements were increased supply costs driven by increased fossil fuel and purchased power prices 
southwestern us southwestern us non trading margins were lower in compared with  primarily due to the sale of ppl s sundance plant in may and the cost to terminate a tolling arrangement on the griffith plant during the second quarter of southwestern us non trading margins were lower in compared with  primarily due to a decrease in wholesale volumes 
also contributing to the decrease in margins was a million positive impact to margins related to a partial reversal of a reserve against enron receivables 
net energy trading ppl enters into certain energy contracts that meet the criteria of trading derivatives as defined by eitf issue  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
these physical and financial contracts cover trading activity associated with electricity  gas and oil 
net energy trading margins increased by million in compared with  primarily due to the inclusion of ftrs 
as of july   ftrs were deemed to meet the definition of a derivative and were accounted for as such prospectively 
therefore  the forward and realized value for ftrs entered into for speculative purposes is accounted for as part of net energy trading margins on the statement of income 
from july  through december   gains on speculative ftrs totaled million

operating activities net cash from operating activities decreased by  or million  in compared with  primarily as a result of increased income tax payments and fuel expenditures  partially offset by favorable margin impacts attributable to the increase in distribution rates and transmission cost recoveries effective january  income tax payments increased primarily due to favorable impacts of tax credits and refunds realized in fuel expenditures increased million due to increased prices and inventory build up in anticipation of price increases in net cash from operating activities increased by  or million  in compared with  reflecting higher energy margins and other improvements in cash adjusted net income 
ppl expects to continue to maintain stable cash provided by operating activities as a result of its long term and intermediate term power sales commitments from wholesale and retail customers and long term fuel purchase contracts 
ppl estimates that  on average  approximately of its expected annual generation output for the period through is committed under long term and intermediate term power sales contracts 
ppl currently estimates that approximately of its expected generation output for is committed under power sales contracts  due to the expiration of the plr contracts at the end of consistent with its business strategy  ppl expects that the capacity and energy currently committed to long term power sales contracts will be contracted in the wholesale markets during the next few years 
based on the way in which the wholesale markets have developed to this point  new contracts may be of a shorter duration than the plr supply contracts with ppl electric  which at inception had terms of approximately nine years 
ppl s contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel often require cash collateral or other credit enhancement  or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement  in the event of a downgrade of ppl s or its subsidiaries credit ratings or adverse changes in market prices 
for example  in addition to limiting its trading ability  if ppl s or its subsidiaries ratings were lowered to below investment grade and energy prices increased by  ppl estimates that  based on its december  positions  it would have had to post additional collateral of approximately million  compared with million at december  ppl has in place risk management programs that are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of cash flows related to changes in energy prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  counterparty credit quality and the operational performance of its generating units

for compared with  ppl received million of proceeds from the sale of ppl s minority interest in cge in  which was partially offset by a net increase of million in restricted cash  an increase of million in net purchases of auction rate securities and an increase of million in net purchases of emission allowances 
the primary use of cash in investing activities is capital expenditures

in february  ppl announced its expectation that the growth rate of its dividends over the next few years will continue to exceed the growth rate in the company s earnings per share and  therefore  result in a dividend payout ratio above percent after any future dividends are subject to the board of directors quarterly dividend declarations  based on the company s financial position and other relevant considerations at the time

based on their respective reviews  the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions 
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit worthiness associated with particular securities issued by ppl and its subsidiaries based on information provided by ppl and other sources 
the ratings of moody s  s amp  p and fitch are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any securities of ppl or its subsidiaries 
such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to their securities 
a downgrade in ppl s or its subsidiaries credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets

the rating agencies took the following actions on the debt and preferred securities of ppl and its subsidiaries in and through february moody s in june  moody s revised its outlooks to stable from negative on the senior unsecured debt and issuer ratings of wpdh limited  the senior unsecured debt ratings of wpd llp and the subordinated unsecured debt ratings of wpd llp s unconsolidated subsidiary siuk capital trust i 
moody s indicated that this positive change to the financial profiles resulted from a reduction in consolidated adjusted leverage at the wpd companies as a result of the redeployment to wpd of surplus cash from latin american subsidiaries of ppl and from ppl s commitment to suspend its dividend from wpdh limited in at the same time  moody s affirmed the wpd companies long term and short term credit rating 
the outlook on the debt ratings of wpd south wales and wpd south west was already stable 
s amp  p in january  s amp  p affirmed ppl electric s a a corporate credit ratings and favorably revised its outlook on the company to stable from negative following the authorization of a million rate increase by the puc 
s amp  p indicated that the outlook revision reflects its expectations that the rate increase  effective january   will allow for material improvement in ppl electric s financial profile  which had lagged s amp  p s expectations in recent years 
s amp  p indicated that the stable outlook reflects its expectations that ppl electric will rapidly improve and then maintain financial metrics more consistent with its ratings 
s amp  p indicated that it expects ppl electric s operations to remain stable through the expiration of the plr agreement 
additionally  in january  s amp  p revised its outlooks on the wpd companies to stable from negative 
s amp  p attributed this positive change to financial profile improvements resulting from the final regulatory outcome published by ofgem in november at the same time  s amp  p affirmed the wpd companies long term and short term credit ratings 
in october  s amp  p affirmed its bbb corporate credit rating of ppl and also affirmed its ratings of ppl energy supply  ppl electric and ppl montana 
the ratings affirmation is the result of s amp  p s annual review of ppl  including its business and financial risk profiles 
fitch in january  fitch announced that it downgraded the wpd companies senior unsecured credit ratings by one notch wpdh limited to bbb from bbb  wpd llp to bbb from bbb  and wpd south wales and wpd south west to bbb f from a f fitch stated that its downgrade was prompted by the high level of pension adjusted leverage at wpd 
fitch acknowledged that wpd s funding plan should reduce its pension deficit over time  and it expects wpd to proceed with its de leveraging program 
however  fitch indicated that it is not certain enough  due to the unpredictability in future pension valuations  that pension adjusted leverage will support a bbb rating at wpdh limited 
fitch indicated that wpd south wales and wpd south west have been downgraded to maintain a two notch differential with wpdh limited because fitch does not believe that wpd s financial ring fencing is restrictive enough to support a three notch differential 
in december  fitch affirmed ppl montana s amortizing pass through certificates  the last of which are due  at bbb 
fitch indicated that the rating reflects ppl montana s credit quality on a stand alone basis 
in december  fitch assigned issuer default ratings idrs for its north american global power portfolio of issuers with ratings of bb or higher 
the idr reflects fitch s assessment of an issuer s ability to meet all of its financial commitments on a timely basis  effectively becoming its benchmark probability of default 
fitch rates securities in an issuer s capital structure higher  lower or the same as the idr based on fitch s assessment of a particular security s relative recovery prospects 
there were no changes in fitch s securities ratings at ppl  ppl capital funding  ppl energy supply or ppl electric as a result of fitch s assignment of an idr 
in february  fitch s europe  middle east and africa group implemented idrs based on its new idr methodology 
this implementation led to fitch s assignment of the following idrs and fitch s revision of its ratings on the following securities currently outstanding at wpd and its affiliates 
wpdh limited idr of bbb and senior unsecured rating to bbb from bbb  wpd llp idr of bbb  senior unsecured rating to bbb from bbb and preferred stock rating to bbb from bbb  and wpd south wales and wpd south west idr of bbb and senior unsecured debt rating to a from bbb 
fitch s outlook for wpd and its affiliates remains stable 
ratings triggers ppl energy supply s million of convertible senior notes due are convertible upon the occurrence of certain events  including if the long term credit ratings assigned to the notes by moody s and s amp  p are lower than bb and ba  or either moody s or s amp  p no longer rates the notes 
the terms of the notes require cash settlement of the principal amount upon conversion of the notes 
see note to the financial statements for more information concerning the convertible senior notes 
ppl and its subsidiaries do not have additional material liquidity exposures caused by a ratings downgrade below investment grade that would accelerate the due dates of borrowings 
however  if ppl s and ppl energy supply s debt ratings had been below investment grade at december   ppl and ppl energy supply would have had to post an additional million of collateral to counterparties 
off balance sheet arrangements ppl provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements that enable certain transactions 
some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that  if not met  would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates access to funds under these financing arrangements  require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates ability to enter into certain transactions 
at this time  ppl believes that these covenants will not limit access to the relevant funding sources 
ppl has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the scope of fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no

risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other market risk background market risk is the potential loss ppl may incur as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument 
ppl is exposed to market risk from commodity price risk associated with the sale and purchase of energy and energy related products  and the purchase of fuel for the generating assets and energy trading activities  interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt and the fair value of fixed rate debt used to finance operations  as well as the fair value of debt securities invested in by ppl s nuclear decommissioning trust funds  foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with investments in affiliates in latin america and europe  as well as purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars  and equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of equity securities invested in by ppl s nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
ppl has a risk management policy approved by its board of directors to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk 
credit risk is discussed below 
the rmc  comprised of senior management and chaired by the vice president risk management  oversees the risk management function 
key risk control activities designed to monitor compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include  but are not limited to  credit review and approval  validation of transactions and market prices  verification of risk and transaction limits  sensitivity analyses  daily portfolio reporting  including open positions  mark to market valuations and other risk measurement metrics 
the forward looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future  assuming certain adverse market conditions  due to reliance on model assumptions 
actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
contract valuation ppl utilizes forward contracts  futures contracts  options  swaps and tolling agreements as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency volatility  when available  quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial instrument 
this may include exchange prices  the average mid point bid ask spreads obtained from brokers  or an independent valuation by an external source  such as a bank 
however  market prices for energy or energy related contracts may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity 
if no active trading market exists  contracts are valued using internally developed models  which are then reviewed by an independent  internal group 
although ppl believes that its valuation methods are reasonable  changes in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different values and realization in future periods 
to record energy derivatives at their fair value  ppl discounts the forward values using the us utility bbb curve 
additionally  ppl adjusts derivative carrying values to recognize differences in counterparty credit quality and potential illiquidity in the market the credit adjustment takes into account the probability of default  as calculated by an independent service  for each counterparty that has an out of the money position with ppl 
the liquidity adjustment takes into account the fact that it may not be appropriate to value contracts at the midpoint of the bid ask spread 
ppl might have to accept the bid price if ppl wants to close an open sales position or ppl might have to accept the ask price if ppl wants to close an open purchase position 
the modeling adjustment takes into account market value for certain contracts when there is no external market to value the contract or when ppl is unable to find independent confirmation of the true market value of the contract 
accounting and reporting to account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk  ppl follows the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  and interpreted by dig issues together  sfas  eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  and eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability unless they meet sfas s criteria for exclusion and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  which amends and clarifies sfas to improve financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are accounted for similarly  sfas clarified the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative  clarified when a derivative contains a financing component  amended the definition of an underlying and amended certain other existing pronouncements 
additionally  sfas placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or normal sale exception 
sfas was effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june   except certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that did not yet exist  ppl adopted sfas as of july  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on ppl 
in accordance with eitf  ppl reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in the net energy trading margins line on the statement of income 
non derivative contracts that met the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  unrealized gains and losses are not reflected in the financial statements 
ppl adopted the final provisions of eitf prospectively as of october  as a result of this adoption  non trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points 
a major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available 
see note to the financial statements for the impact of the adoption of eitf ppl s short term derivative contracts are recorded as price risk management assets and price risk management liabilities on the balance sheet 
long term derivative contracts are included in regulatory and other noncurrent assets other and deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities other 
accounting designation energy contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting treatment 
for energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative  the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine their accounting designation 
in addition to energy related transactions  ppl enters into financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances 
ppl also enters into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations 
as with energy transactions  the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the transaction determine a contract s accounting designation 
these designations are verified by a separate internal group on a daily basis 
see note to the financial statements for a summary of the guidelines that have been provided to the traders who are responsible for the designation of derivative energy contracts 
commodity price risk non trading commodity price risk is one of ppl s most significant risks due to the level of investment that ppl maintains in its generation assets  coupled with the volatility of prices for energy and energy related products 
several factors influence price levels and volatilities 
these factors include  but are not limited to  seasonal changes in demand  weather conditions  available generating assets within regions  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  market liquidity  and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations 
to hedge the impact of market price fluctuations on ppl s energy related assets  liabilities and other contractual arrangements  ppl energyplus sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under ferc market based tariffs throughout the us and enters into financial exchange traded and over the counter contracts 
because ppl owns or controls generating assets  the majority of ppl s energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge accounting 
additionally  the non trading portfolio includes the fair value of options that are economic hedges of ppl s synthetic fuel tax credits 
although they do not receive hedge accounting treatment  these options are considered non trading 
within ppl s non trading portfolio  the decision to enter into energy contracts hinges on the expected value of ppl s generation 
to address this risk  ppl takes a conservative approach in determining the number of mwhs that are available to be sold forward 
in this regard  ppl reduces the maximum potential output that a plant may produce by three factors planned maintenance  unplanned outages and economic conditions 
the potential output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a particular unit 
another reduction  representing the unplanned outage rate  is the amount of mwhs that historically is not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment breakage 
finally  the potential output of certain plants such as peaking units is reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow them to economically run during all hours 
ppl s non trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy contracts 
the net obligation to serve these contracts changes minute by minute 
ppl analyzes historical on peak and off peak usage patterns  as well as spot prices and weather patterns  to determine a monthly level of a block of electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings volatility 
on a forward basis  ppl reserves a block amount of generation for full requirements energy contracts that is expected to be the best match with their anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks 
anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks are affected by expected load changes  regional economic drivers and seasonality

the fair value of electricity positions recorded above use the midpoint of the bid ask spreads obtained through otc brokers 
on average  otc quotes for forwards and swaps of natural gas and power extend one and two years into the future 
the prices based on models and other valuation methods category includes the value of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as a result of the long dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the market point  or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or otc broker 
because of ppl s efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its generation assets  ppl sells electricity and buys fuel on a forward basis  resulting in open contractual positions 
if ppl were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements  under certain circumstances it could be required to pay damages 
these damages would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price of the commodity 
depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets  such damages could be significant 
extreme weather conditions  unplanned power plant outages  transmission disruptions  non performance by counterparties or their own counterparties with which it has energy contracts and other factors could affect ppl s ability to meet its obligations  or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement energy 
although ppl attempts to mitigate these risks  there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations  that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform  or that it will not experience counterparty non performance in the future 
as of december   ppl estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its non trading portfolio by approximately million  compared with a decrease of million at december  for purposes of this calculation  an increase in the market price for electricity is considered an adverse movement because ppl s electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position  and the decrease in the market price for fuel is considered an adverse movement because ppl s commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net purchase position 
ppl enters into those commodity contracts to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity 
in accordance with its marketing strategy  ppl does not completely hedge its generation output or fuel requirements 
ppl estimates that for its entire portfolio  including all generation  emissions and physical and financial energy positions  a adverse change in power prices across all geographic zones and time periods would decrease expected gross margins by million 
similarly  a adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices would decrease gross margins by million 
commodity price risk trading ppl also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market opportunities 
as a result  ppl may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated 
the margins from these trading activities are shown in the statement of income as net energy trading margins

ppl utilizes various financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio  adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in us treasury rates and interest rate spreads over treasuries in anticipation of future financing  when appropriate 
risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of ppl s debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   ppl s potential annual exposure to increased interest expense  based on a increase in interest rates  was estimated at million  compared with a million exposure at december  ppl is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international debt portfolios 
at december   ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared with million at december  ppl utilizes various risk management instruments to reduce its exposure to the expected future cash flow variability of its debt instruments 
these risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financing

at december   ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared with a million exposure at december  foreign currency risk ppl is exposed to foreign currency risk  primarily through investments in affiliates in the uk and latin america 
in addition  ppl may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars 
ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures  including firm commitments  recognized assets or liabilities and net investments 
in addition  ppl enters into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk 
to protect expected income in chilean pesos  ppl entered into an average rate forward for billion chilean pesos 
the settlement date of this forward is november at december   the market value of this position  representing the amount ppl would pay upon its termination  was insignificant 
ppl estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the market value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in foreign exchange rates  was insignificant at december  wpdh limited holds a net position in cross currency swaps totaling billion to hedge the interest payments and value of its us dollar denominated bonds with maturity dates ranging from december to december the estimated value of this position at december   being the amount ppl would pay to terminate it  including accrued interest  was approximately million

as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed rate  fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on ppl s balance sheet 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund susquehanna s decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs 
however  the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets  and the values of fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ppl susquehanna actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement 
at december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates and a decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets  compared with a million reduction at december  see note to the financial statements for more information regarding the nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
synthetic fuel tax credit risk recent increases in and the volatility of crude oil prices threaten to reduce the amount of synthetic fuel tax credits that ppl expects to receive through its synthetic fuel production 
the tax credits are reduced if the annual average wellhead price of domestic crude oil falls within a phase out range 
the tax credits are eliminated if this reference price exceeds the phase out range 
see regulatory issues irs synthetic fuels tax credits in note to the financial statements for more information regarding the phase out of the tax credits 
ppl implemented a risk management objective to hedge a portion of the variability of cash flows associated with its and synthetic fuel tax credits by hedging the risk that the and annual average wellhead price for domestic crude oil will be within the phase out range 
ppl purchased options in to mitigate some of the reductions in synthetic fuel tax credits if the annual average wellhead price for and falls within the applicable phase out range 
these positions did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
the mark to market value of these positions as of december   was a gain of million  and is reflected in energy related businesses revenues on the statement of income 
as of december   ppl estimated that a adverse movement in market prices of crude oil would have decreased the value of the synthetic fuel hedges by million 
for purposes of this calculation  a decrease in the market price for crude oil is considered an adverse movement 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that ppl would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
ppl maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparties including requirements that counterparties maintain certain credit ratings criteria and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk 
however  ppl has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities  natural gas distribution companies and other energy marketing and trading companies 
these concentrations of counterparties may impact ppl s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic  regulatory or other conditions 
as discussed above in contract valuation  ppl records certain non performance reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out of the money from the counterparty s standpoint will default in its performance 
in this case  ppl would have to sell into a lower priced market or purchase from a higher priced market 
these reserves are reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in price risk management assets on the balance sheet 
ppl also records reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries ppl has made but not yet billed 
these reserves are reflected in unbilled revenues on the balance sheet 
ppl also has established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the california iso for which ppl has not yet been paid  as well as a reserve related to ppl s exposure as a result of the enron bankruptcy  which are reflected in accounts receivable on the balance sheet

changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements 
these accounting policies are also discussed in note to the financial statements

 pension and other postretirement benefits ppl follows the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these pension and other postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
the objective  in selecting the  discount rate is to measure the single amount that  if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs ppl records currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting a discount rate for its domestic pension and other postretirement plans  ppl starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans 
this information is first matched against a spot rate yield curve 
a portfolio of nearly moody s aa graded non callable corporate bonds  with a total outstanding float in excess of billion  serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve 
the results of this analysis are considered in conjunction with other economic data and consideration of movements in the moody s aa bond index to determine the discount rate assumption 
at december   ppl decreased the discount rate for its domestic plans from to as a result of this assessment 
the selection of a discount rate for the international pension plans of wpd again starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment streams 
this information is analyzed against yields on long term high quality corporate bonds within the iboxx index 
due to the flatness of uk yield curves  the duration weighted discount rate is approximately the same 
at december  ppl decreased the discount rate for its international pension plans from to as a result of this assessment 
in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl considers tax implications  past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans 
at december   ppl s expected return on plan assets was decreased from to for its domestic pension plans and increased to from for its other postretirement benefit plans 
for its international plans  ppl s expected return on plan assets was reduced from to at december  both ppl s domestic and international pension plans have significantly exceeded the expected return on plan assets for and however  the expected return on plan assets assumption was decreased to reflect a long term view of equity markets and an expected increase in long term bond yields 
in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl s rate of compensation increase was changed to from for its domestic plans 
for its international plans  ppl s rate of compensation increase remained at at december  in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl considers past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december   ppl s health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on projected benefit obligations  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and other comprehensive income oci 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities in the financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions 
while the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and oci by a similar amount in the opposite direction 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
increase decrease actuarial assumption change in assumption impact on obligation impact on liabilities a impact on cost impact on oci discount rate expected return on plan assets n a rate of compensation increase health care cost trend rate b n a a excludes the impact of additional minimum liability 
b only impacts other postretirement benefits 
ppl s total net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation as of december  was million 
ppl recognized an aggregate net accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liability of million on its balance sheet as of december  the total obligation is not fully reflected in the current financial statements due to the delayed recognition criteria of the accounting standards for these obligations 
in ppl recognized net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged to operating expenses of million 
this amount represents a million increase from this increase in expense was primarily attributable to ppl s international plans and was the result of the decrease in the discount rate at december   and recognition of prior losses 
the pension plans of wpd have accumulated deferred losses of million as of december   as a result of changes in the discount rate assumption  expected compared with actual asset returns and changes in demographic assumptions and experience 
the losses  to the extent not offset by future gains  will be amortized in accordance with ppl s policy regarding recognition of gains and losses as detailed in note to the financial statements 
strong asset returns and falling foreign currency conversion rates offset the impact of the decrease in the discount rate  allowing ppl to reduce its additional minimum pension liability for its international pension plans  offset by a modest increase for ppl s domestic pension plans 
recording the change in the additional minimum liability resulted in a million decrease to the pension related charge to oci  net of taxes  translation adjustment and unrecognized prior service costs  with no effect on net income 
the pension related balance in oci  which is a reduction to shareowners equity  was reduced from million at december   to million at december the charges to oci will reverse in future periods if the fair value of trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation 
refer to note to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits 
asset impairment ppl performs impairment analyses for long lived assets  including intangibles  that are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
ppl tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long lived asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances are a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for a long lived asset  an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the asset is impaired  an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset s carrying value to its estimated fair value 
in determining asset impairments  management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows  the useful lives of long lived assets  the fair value of the assets and management s intent to use the assets 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
for determining fair value  the fasb has indicated that quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value 
however  when market prices are unavailable  other valuation techniques may be used 
ppl has generally used a present value technique ie  discounted cash flow 
discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the cash flow streams 
ppl has determined that  when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset are being considered  it uses estimated cash flows from the most likely approach to assess impairment whenever one scenario is clearly the most likely outcome 
if no scenario is clearly most likely  then a probability weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternative scenarios 
for assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet date  the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date  including the assessment of the likelihood of the future sale of the assets 
that assessment made as of the balance sheet date is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date 
during  ppl and its subsidiaries evaluated certain gas fired generation assets for impairment  as events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
ppl did not record an impairment of these gas fired generation assets in for these impairment analyses  the most significant assumption was the estimate of future cash flows 
ppl estimates future cash flows using information from its corporate business plan adjusted for any recent sale or purchase commitments 
key factors that impact cash flows include projected prices for electricity and gas as well as firm sale and purchase commitments 
a decrease in estimated future cash flows for the gas fired generation assets would not have resulted in an impairment charge 
ppl performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
ppl performs an annual impairment test for goodwill  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
ppl has determined its reporting units to be one level below its operating segments 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination 
that is  the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
ppl completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of this test did not require any second step assessments and did not result in any impairments 
ppl s most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values 
ppl estimated fair values primarily based upon discounted cash flows 
although a full two step evaluation was not completed  a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of or an increase of the discount rates by basis points would have resulted in the carrying value of certain reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values  indicating a potential impairment of goodwill 
leasing ppl applies the provisions of sfas  accounting for leases  to all leasing transactions 
in addition  ppl applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb and the eitf that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing arrangements 
in general  there are two types of leases from a lessee s perspective operating leases leases accounted for off balance sheet  and capital leases leases capitalized on the balance sheet 
in accounting for leases  management makes various assumptions  including the discount rate  the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated useful life  in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or capital 
changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease  thus significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition to uncertainty inherent in management s assumptions  leasing transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when they involve real estate and or related integral equipment  sale leaseback accounting leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased assets  synthetic leases leases that qualify for operating lease treatment for book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes  and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets 
at december   ppl continued to participate in a significant sale leaseback transaction 
in july  ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four year operating leases 
this transaction is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with current rules related to sale leaseback arrangements 
if for any reason this transaction did not meet the requirements for off balance sheet operating lease treatment as a sale leaseback  ppl would have recorded approximately million of additional assets and approximately million of additional liabilities on its balance sheet at december   and would have recorded additional expenses currently estimated at million  after tax  in see note to the financial statements for additional information related to operating leases 
loss accruals ppl periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies  and other related accounting guidance 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
ppl continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  income taxes  regulatory penalties and other events 
ppl also has accrued estimated losses on long term purchase commitments when significant events have occurred 
for example  estimated losses were accrued when long term purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements and when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
under regulatory accounting  ppl electric recorded the above market cost of energy purchases from nugs as part of its purchased power costs on an as incurred basis  since these costs were recovered in regulated rates 
when the generation business was deregulated  the estimated loss associated with these long term purchase commitments to make above market nug purchases was recorded because ppl electric was committed to purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover these costs in regulated rates 
the accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include the initial identification and recording of the loss  the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual  and the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient 
all three of these aspects of accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by ppl s management 
initial identification and recording of the loss accrual ppl uses its internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
two significant loss accruals were recorded in the first was the loss accrual related to the pjm billing dispute 
the second involved the accrual of remediation expenses in connection with the ash basin leak at the martins creek generating station 
significant judgment was required by ppl s management to perform the initial assessment of these contingencies 
in december  exelon corporation  on behalf of its subsidiary  peco energy  inc peco  filed a complaint against pjm and ppl electric with the ferc  alleging that pjm had overcharged peco from april through may as a result of an error by pjm 
the complaint requested the ferc  among other things  to direct ppl electric to refund to pjm million  plus interest of approximately million  and for pjm to refund these same amounts to peco 
in april  the ferc issued an order establishing hearing and settlement judge proceedings the order 
in the order  the ferc determined that peco was entitled to reimbursement for the transmission congestion charges that peco asserted pjm erroneously billed 
the ferc ordered settlement discussions  before a judge  to determine the amount of the overcharge to peco and the parties responsible for reimbursement to peco 
based on an evaluation of ferc s order  ppl s management concluded that it was probable that a loss had been incurred in connection with the pjm billing dispute 
ppl electric recorded a loss accrual of million  the amount of peco s claim  in the first quarter of in august  a leak from a disposal basin containing fly ash and water at the martins creek generating station caused a discharge from the basin onto adjacent roadways and fields  and into a nearby creek and the delaware river 
ppl immediately began to work with the pennsylvania dep and appropriate agencies and consultants to assess the extent of environmental damage caused by the discharge and to remediate the damage 
at that time  ppl had  and still has  no reason to believe that the martins creek leak has caused any danger to human health or any adverse biological impact on the river aquatic life 
however  at that time  ppl expected that it would be subject to an enforcement action by the pennsylvania dep and that claims may be brought against it by several state agencies and private litigants 
ppl s management assessed the contingency in the third quarter of the ultimate cost of the remediation effort was difficult to estimate due to a number of uncertainties  such as the scope of the project  the impact of weather conditions on the ash recovery effort  and the ultimate outcome of enforcement actions and private litigation 
ppl s management concluded  at the time  that million was the best estimate of the cost of the remediation effort 
ppl recorded this loss accrual in the third quarter of see note to the financial statements for additional information on both of these contingencies and see ongoing assessment of recorded loss accruals for a discussion of the year end assessments of these contingencies 
ppl has identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss  but that do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas  sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
the fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas reducing recorded loss accruals when an estimated loss is accrued  ppl identifies  where applicable  the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred  or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals certain loss accruals are systematically reduced based on the expiration of contract terms 
an example of this is the loss accrual for above market nug purchase commitments  which is described below 
this loss accrual is being reduced over the lives of the nug purchase contracts 
allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted or when underlying amounts are ultimately collected 
environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and ppl makes actual payments or the loss is no longer considered probable 
the largest loss accrual on ppl s balance sheet  and the loss accrual that changed most significantly in  was for an impairment of above market nug purchase commitments 
this loss accrual reflects the estimated difference between the above market contract terms  under the purchase commitments  and the fair value of the electricity to be purchased 
this loss accrual was originally recorded at million in  when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
when the loss accrual related to nug purchases was recorded in  ppl electric established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be reduced 
a schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases over the lives of the nug contracts 
this loss accrual was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july   corporate realignment 
ppl energyplus continues to reduce the above market nug liability based on the aforementioned schedule 
as ppl energyplus reduces the liability for the above market nug purchases  it offsets the actual cost of nug purchases  thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in line with expected market prices 
the above market loss accrual was million at december  this loss accrual will be significantly reduced by  when all but one of the nug contracts expires 
the then remaining nug contract will expire in ongoing assessment of recorded loss accruals ppl reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient 
this involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  operation management and other parties 
significant management judgment is required in developing ppl s contingencies  or reserves  for income taxes and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the ongoing assessment of tax contingencies is intended to result in management s best estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for each tax year 
annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities 
however  the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised by such authorities may differ from the amount accrued 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  ppl accounts for changes in probable exposures based on management s best estimate of the amount that should be recognized 
an allowance is maintained for the tax contingencies  the balance of which management believes to be adequate 
the ongoing assessment of valuation allowances is based on an assessment of whether deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized 
management considers a number of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets  including forecasts of taxable income in future periods 
as part of the year end preparation of its financial statements  ppl s management re assessed the loss accruals recorded earlier in the year for the two contingencies described above under initial identification and recording of the loss accrual 
see note to the financial statements for additional information 
in re assessing the pjm billing dispute  ppl s management considered the proposed settlement agreement that was filed with ferc in september under the settlement agreement  ppl electric would pay million plus interest over a four year period to pjm through a new transmission charge that  under applicable law  is recoverable from ppl electric s retail customers 
also  all pjm market participants would pay approximately million plus interest over a four year period to pjm through a new market adjustment charge 
pjm would forward amounts collected under the two new charges to peco 
numerous parties filed comments with the ferc opposing the settlement agreement  and the ferc has not yet acted on the proposed settlement agreement 
accordingly  ppl s management had no basis to revise the loss accrual that was recorded in the first quarter of ppl s management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency in future periods 
ppl also re assessed the contingency for the martins creek ash basin remediation 
based on the ongoing remediation efforts and communications with the pennsylvania dep and other appropriate agencies  ppl s management concluded that million was currently the best estimate of the cost of the remediation effort 
therefore  ppl revised the loss accrual in the fourth quarter of ppl cannot predict the final cost of assessment and remediation of the leak  the outcome of the action initiated by the pennsylvania dep or the action initiated by the delaware riverside conservancy and several citizens  the outcome of the natural resource damage assessment  the exact nature of any other regulatory or other legal actions that may be initiated against ppl as a result of the disposal basin leak  the extent of the fines or damages that may be sought in connection with any such actions or the ultimate financial impact on ppl 
ppl s management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency in future periods 
asset retirement obligations sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized as a liability in the financial statements 
the initial obligation should be measured at the estimated fair value 
an equivalent amount should be recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
until the obligation is settled  the liability should be increased  through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement  for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time 
fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which was issued in march  and adopted by ppl effective december   clarified the term conditional aro as used in sfas fin specified that a conditional aro must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the aro can be reasonably estimated 
see note for further discussion of the impact of fin on ppl 
in determining aros  management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value 
fair value is developed through consideration of estimated retirement costs in today s dollars  inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the aro was incurred 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of aros could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
at december   ppl had aros totaling million recorded on the balance sheet 
ppl s most significant assumptions surrounding aros are the forecasted retirement costs  the discount rates and the inflation rates 
a variance in the forecasted retirement costs  the discount rates or the inflation rates could have a significant impact on the aro liabilities 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the aro liabilities as of december   associated with a change in these assumptions at the time of initial recognition 
there is no significant change to the aro asset values  depreciation expense of the aro assets or accretion expense of the aro liabilities as a result of changing the assumptions 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption

see item business background  for descriptions of ppl energy supply s domestic and international businesses 
ppl energy supply s reportable segments are supply and international delivery 
see exhibit a in item for a listing of its principal subsidiaries 
through its subsidiaries  ppl energy supply is primarily engaged in the generation and marketing of electricity in two key markets the northeastern and western us and in the delivery of electricity in the us and latin america 
ppl energy supply s overall strategy is to achieve disciplined growth in energy supply margins while limiting volatility in both cash flows and earnings and to achieve stable  long term growth in regulated international delivery businesses through efficient operations and strong customer and regulatory relations 
more specifically  ppl energy supply s strategy for its electricity generation and marketing business is to match energy supply with load  or customer demand  under contracts of varying lengths with creditworthy counterparties to capture profits while effectively managing exposure to movements in energy and fuel prices and counterparty credit risk 
ppl energy supply s strategy for its international electricity delivery businesses is to own and operate these businesses at the most efficient cost while maintaining the highest level of customer service and reliability 
ppl energy supply faces several risks in its generation business 
the principal risks are electricity wholesale price risk  fuel supply and price risk  power plant performance and counterparty credit risk 
ppl energy supply attempts to manage these risks through various means 
for instance  ppl energy supply operates a portfolio of generation assets that is diversified as to geography  fuel source  cost structure and operating characteristics 
ppl energy supply is focused on the operating efficiency of these power plants and maintaining their availability 
in addition  ppl energy supply has in place and continues to pursue contracts of varying lengths for energy sales and fuel supply  and other means  to mitigate the risks associated with adverse changes in the difference  or margin  between the cost to produce electricity and the price at which ppl energy supply sells it 
whether ppl energy supply decides to  or is able to  continue to enter into long term or intermediate term power sales and fuel purchase agreements or renew its existing agreements and the market conditions at that time will affect its future profitability 
currently  ppl energy supply s commitments for energy sales are substantially satisfied through its own generation assets ie  ppl energy supply primarily markets and trades around its physical portfolio of generating assets through integrated generation  marketing and trading functions 
ppl energy supply has in place risk management programs that  among other things  are designed to monitor and manage its exposure to volatility of earnings and cash flows related to changes in energy and fuel prices  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  counterparty credit quality and the operational performance of its generating units 
ppl energy supply s international electricity delivery businesses are rate regulated 
accordingly  these businesses are subject to regulatory risk in terms of the costs that they may recover and the investment returns that they may collect in customer rates 
the principal challenge that ppl energy supply faces in its international electricity delivery businesses is to maintain high standards of customer service and reliability in a cost effective manner 
ppl energy supply faces additional financial risks in conducting international operations  such as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
ppl energy supply attempts to manage these financial risks through its risk management programs 
a key challenge for ppl energy supply s business as a whole is to maintain a strong credit profile 
investors  analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry continue to be focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of these companies 
ppl energy supply continually focuses on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position  thereby improving its credit profile 
see item a

bethel generation facilities  in accordance with fin and higher long term interest expense 
the improved earnings contribution from synfuel projects for both periods resulted primarily from higher synthetic fuel tax credits due to higher output at the tyrone facility  which went into commercial operation in august also contributing to the synthetic fuel earnings increase were unrealized gains on options purchased to hedge the risk associated with synthetic fuel tax credits for and outlook based on current forward energy prices  ppl energy supply is projecting higher energy margins for the supply segment in compared with  primarily driven by the increase in the generation prices under the plr contracts 
higher generation output  higher priced wholesale energy contracts that replace expiring contracts  and lower purchased power costs also are expected to improve energy margins 
these benefits are expected to be partially offset by increased fuel and fuel transportation expenses  higher operation and maintenance expenses and reduced earnings from synfuel projects

average coal prices increased by over last year  while average gas and oil prices increased by 
despite record high generation in  the increased use of higher cost oil and gas units to cover retail volumes  which were up over  and generation output lost during coal and nuclear plant outages contributed to lower margins 
due to market price increases and changes in fuel mix  average fuel prices increased over partially offsetting the effects of higher supply costs was a increase in retail energy prices  in accordance with the schedule established by the puc final order 
eastern us non trading margins were higher in compared with  primarily due to higher generation  as well as higher prices and slightly higher sales volumes 
in pjm  where the majority of ppl energy supply s eastern wholesale activity occurs  average spot prices rose in over ppl energy supply also benefited from favorable transmission congestion positions 
in addition  retail energy prices increased by approximately in in accordance with the schedule established by the puc 
the higher sales volumes reflect the return of customers who had previously shopped for electricity  as well as new load obligations in connecticut and new jersey  partially offset by lower wholesale sales 
partially offsetting these improvements were increased supply costs driven by increased fossil fuel and purchased power prices 
southwestern us southwestern us non trading margins were lower in compared with  primarily due to the sale of ppl energy supply s sundance plant in may and the cost to terminate a tolling arrangement on the griffith plant during the second quarter of southwestern us non trading margins were lower in compared with  primarily due to a decrease in wholesale sales volumes 
also contributing to the decrease in margins was a million positive impact to margins related to a partial reversal of a reserve against enron receivables

the following table summarizes the credit ratings of ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries at december  moody s s amp  p fitch a ppl energy supply issuer rating bbb bbb senior unsecured notes baa bbb bbb commercial paper p a f outlook stable stable stable ppl montana pass through certificates baa bbb bbb outlook stable stable wpdh limited issuer rating baa bbb senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb short term debt a outlook stable stable stable wpd llp issuer rating bbb senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb short term debt a preferred stock baa bb bbb outlook stable stable stable wpd south wales issuer rating bbb senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb short term debt a f outlook stable stable stable wpd south west issuer rating baa bbb senior unsecured debt baa bbb bbb short term debt p a f outlook stable stable stable a all issuer ratings for fitch are issuer default ratings 
the rating agencies took the following actions on the debt and preferred securities of ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries in and through february moody s in june  moody s revised its outlooks to stable from negative on the senior unsecured debt and issuer ratings of wpdh limited  the senior unsecured debt ratings of wpd llp and the subordinated unsecured debt ratings of wpd llp s unconsolidated subsidiary siuk capital trust i 
moody s indicated that this positive change to the financial profiles resulted from a reduction in consolidated adjusted leverage at the wpd companies as a result of the redeployment to wpd of surplus cash from latin american subsidiaries of ppl energy supply and from ppl energy supply s commitment to suspend its dividend from wpdh limited in at the same time  moody s affirmed the wpd companies long term and short term credit rating 
the outlook on the debt ratings of wpd south wales and wpd south west was already stable 
s amp  p in january  s amp  p revised its outlooks on the wpd companies to stable from negative 
s amp  p attributes this positive change to financial profile improvements resulting from the final regulatory outcome published by ofgem in november at the same time  s amp  p affirmed the wpd companies long term and short term credit ratings 
in october  s amp  p affirmed its ratings of ppl energy supply and ppl montana 
the ratings affirmation is the result of s amp  p s annual review of ppl energy supply  including its business and financial risk profiles 
fitch in january  fitch announced that it downgraded the wpd companies senior unsecured credit ratings by one notch wpdh limited to bbb from bbb  wpd llp to bbb from bbb  and wpd south wales and wpd south west to bbb f from a f fitch stated that its downgrade was prompted by the high level of pension adjusted leverage at wpd 
fitch acknowledged that wpd s funding plan should reduce its pension deficit over time  and it expects wpd to proceed with its de leveraging program 
however  fitch indicated that it is not certain enough  due to the unpredictability in future pension valuations  that pension adjusted leverage will support a bbb rating at wpdh limited 
fitch indicated that wpd south wales and wpd south west have been downgraded to maintain a two notch differential with wpdh limited because fitch does not believe that wpd s financial ring fencing is restrictive enough to support a three notch differential 
in december  fitch affirmed ppl montana s amortizing pass through certificates  the last of which are due  at bbb 
fitch indicated that the rating reflects ppl montana s credit quality on a stand alone basis 
in december  fitch assigned issuer default ratings idrs for its north american global power portfolio of issuers with ratings of bb or higher 
the idr reflects fitch s assessment of an issuer s ability to meet all of its financial commitments on a timely basis  effectively becoming its benchmark probability of default 
fitch rates securities in an issuer s capital structure higher  lower or the same as the idr based on fitch s assessment of a particular security s relative recovery prospects 
there were no changes in fitch s securities ratings at ppl energy supply as a result of fitch s assignment of an idr 
in february  fitch s europe  middle east and africa group implemented idrs based on its new idr methodology 
this implementation led to fitch s assignment of the following idrs and fitch s revision of its ratings on the following securities currently outstanding at wpd and its affiliates 
wpdh limited idr of bbb and senior unsecured rating to bbb from bbb  wpd llp idr of bbb  senior unsecured rating to bbb from bbb and preferred stock rating to bbb from bbb  and wpd south wales and wpd south west idr of bbb and senior unsecured debt rating to a from bbb 
fitch s outlook for wpd and its affiliates remains stable 
ratings triggers ppl energy supply s million of convertible senior notes due are convertible upon the occurrence of certain events  including if the long term credit ratings assigned to the notes by moody s and s amp  p are lower than bb and ba  or either moody s or s amp  p no longer rates the notes 
the terms of the notes require cash settlement of the principal amount upon conversion of the notes 
see note to the financial statements for more information concerning the convertible senior notes 
ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries do not have additional material liquidity exposures caused by a ratings downgrade below investment grade that would accelerate the due dates of borrowings 
however  if ppl energy supply s debt ratings had been below investment grade at december   ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries would have had to post an additional million of collateral to counterparties 
off balance sheet arrangements ppl energy supply provides guarantees for certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements that enable certain transactions 
some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that  if not met  would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates access to funds under these financing arrangements  require early maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates ability to enter into certain transactions 
at this time  ppl energy supply believes that these covenants will not limit access to the relevant funding sources 
ppl energy supply has entered into certain guarantee agreements that are within the scope of fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no

risk management energy marketing amp  trading and other market risk background market risk is the potential loss ppl energy supply may incur as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument 
ppl energy supply is exposed to market risk from commodity price risk associated with the sale and purchase of energy and energy related products  and the purchase of fuel for the generating assets and energy trading activities  interest rate risk associated with variable rate debt and the fair value of fixed rate debt used to finance operations  as well as the fair value of debt securities invested in by ppl energy supply s nuclear decommissioning trust funds  foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with investments in affiliates in latin america and europe  as well as purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars  and equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of equity securities invested in by ppl energy supply s nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
ppl energy supply has a risk management policy approved by ppl s board of directors to manage market risk and counterparty credit risk 
credit risk is discussed below 
the rmc  comprised of senior management and chaired by the vice president risk management  oversees the risk management function 
key risk control activities designed to monitor compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include  but are not limited to  credit review and approval  validation of transactions and market prices  verification of risk and transaction limits  sensitivity analyses  daily portfolio reporting  including open positions  mark to market valuations and other risk measurement metrics 
the forward looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future  assuming certain adverse market conditions  due to reliance on model assumptions 
actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
contract valuation ppl energy supply utilizes forward contracts  futures contracts  options  swaps and tolling agreements as part of its risk management strategy to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by commodity price  interest rate and foreign currency volatility  when available  quoted market prices are used to determine the fair value of a commodity or financial instrument 
this may include exchange prices  the average mid point bid ask spreads obtained from brokers  or an independent valuation by an external source  such as a bank 
however  market prices for energy or energy related contracts may not be readily determinable because of market illiquidity 
if no active trading market exists  contracts are valued using internally developed models  which are then reviewed by an independent  internal group 
although ppl energy supply believes that its valuation methods are reasonable  changes in the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different values and realization in future periods 
to record energy derivatives at their fair value  ppl energy supply discounts the forward values using the us utility bbb curve 
additionally  ppl energy supply adjusts derivative carrying values to recognize differences in counterparty credit quality and potential illiquidity in the market the credit adjustment takes into account the probability of default  as calculated by an independent service  for each counterparty that has an out of the money position with ppl energy supply 
the liquidity adjustment takes into account the fact that it may not be appropriate to value contracts at the midpoint of the bid ask spread 
ppl energy supply might have to accept the bid price if ppl energy supply wants to close an open sales position or ppl energy supply might have to accept the ask price if ppl energy supply wants to close an open purchase position 
the modeling adjustment takes into account market value for certain contracts when there is no external market to value the contract or when ppl energy supply is unable to find independent confirmation of the true market value of the contract 
accounting and reporting to account for and report on contracts entered into to manage market risk  ppl energy supply follows the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  and interpreted by dig issues together  sfas  eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  and eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to fasb statement no 
and not held for trading purposes as defined in issue no 
sfas requires that all derivative instruments be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as an asset or liability unless they meet sfas s criteria for exclusion and that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  which amends and clarifies sfas to improve financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to ensure that contracts with comparable characteristics are accounted for similarly  sfas clarified the circumstances under which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative  clarified when a derivative contains a financing component  amended the definition of an underlying and amended certain other existing pronouncements 
additionally  sfas placed additional limitations on the use of the normal purchase or normal sale exception 
sfas was effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june   except certain provisions relating to forward purchases or sales of when issued securities or other securities that did not yet exist  ppl energy supply adopted sfas as of july  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on ppl energy supply 
in accordance with eitf  ppl energy supply reflects its net realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with all derivatives that are held for trading purposes in the net energy trading margins line on the statement of income 
non derivative contracts that met the definition of energy trading activities as defined by eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities are reflected in the financial statements using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  unrealized gains and losses are not reflected in the financial statements 
ppl energy supply adopted the final provisions of eitf prospectively as of october  as a result of this adoption  non trading bilateral sales of electricity at major market delivery points are netted with purchases that offset the sales at those same delivery points 
a major market delivery point is any delivery point with liquid pricing available 
see note to the financial statements for the impact of the adoption of eitf ppl energy supply s short term derivative contracts are recorded as price risk management assets and price risk management liabilities on the balance sheet 
long term derivative contracts are included in other noncurrent assets other and deferred credits and other noncurrent liabilities other 
accounting designation energy contracts that do not qualify as derivatives receive accrual accounting treatment 
for energy contracts that meet the definition of a derivative  the circumstances and intent existing at the time that energy transactions are entered into determine their accounting designation 
in addition to energy related transactions  ppl energy supply enters into financial interest rate and foreign currency swap contracts to hedge interest expense associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances 
ppl energy supply also enters into foreign currency swap contracts to hedge the fair value of firm commitments denominated in foreign currency and net investments in foreign operations 
as with energy transactions  the circumstances and intent existing at the time of the transaction determine the contract s accounting designation 
these designations are verified by a separate internal group on a daily basis 
see note to the financial statements for a summary of the guidelines that have been provided to the traders who are responsible for the designation of derivative energy contracts 
commodity price risk non trading commodity price risk is one of ppl energy supply s most significant risks due to the level of investment that ppl energy supply maintains in its generation assets  coupled with the volatility of prices for energy and energy related products 
several factors influence price levels and volatilities 
these factors include  but are not limited to  seasonal changes in demand  weather conditions  available generating assets within regions  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  market liquidity  and the nature and extent of current and potential federal and state regulations 
to hedge the impact of market price fluctuations on ppl energy supply s energy related assets  liabilities and other contractual arrangements  ppl energyplus sells and purchases physical energy at the wholesale level under ferc market based tariffs throughout the us and enters into financial exchange traded and over the counter contracts 
because ppl energy supply owns or controls generating assets  the majority of ppl energy supply s energy transactions qualify for accrual or hedge accounting 
additionally  the non trading portfolio includes the fair value of options that are economic hedges of ppl energy supply s synthetic fuel tax credits 
although they do not receive hedge accounting treatment  these options are considered non trading 
within ppl energy supply s non trading portfolio  the decision to enter into energy contracts hinges on the expected value of ppl energy supply s generation 
to address this risk  ppl energy supply takes a conservative approach in determining the number of mwhs that are available to be sold forward 
in this regard  ppl energy supply reduces the maximum potential output that a plant may produce by three factors planned maintenance  unplanned outages and economic conditions 
the potential output of a plant is first reduced by the amount of unavailable generation due to planned maintenance on a particular unit 
another reduction  representing the unplanned outage rate  is the amount of mwhs that historically are not produced by a plant due to such factors as equipment breakage 
finally  the potential output of certain plants such as peaking units is reduced because their higher cost of production will not allow them to economically run during all hours 
ppl energy supply s non trading portfolio also includes full requirements energy contracts 
the net obligation to serve these contracts changes minute by minute 
ppl energy supply analyzes historical on peak and off peak usage patterns  as well as spot prices and weather patterns  to determine a monthly level of a block of electricity that best fits the usage patterns in order to minimize earnings volatility 
on a forward basis  ppl energy supply reserves a block amount of generation for full requirements energy contracts that is expected to be the best match with their anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks 
anticipated usage patterns and energy peaks are affected by expected load changes  regional economic drivers and seasonality 
ppl energy supply s non trading commodity derivative contracts mature at various times through the following chart sets forth ppl energy supply s net fair market value of these contracts as of december  gains losses fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period fair value of new contracts at inception other changes in fair values fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period the following chart segregates estimated fair values of ppl energy supply s non trading commodity derivative contracts at december   based on whether the fair values are determined by quoted market prices or other more subjective means 
fair value of contracts at period end gains losses maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total fair value source of fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period the prices actively quoted category includes the fair value of exchange traded natural gas futures contracts quoted on the nymex  which has currently quoted prices through the prices provided by other external sources category includes ppl energy supply s forward positions and options in natural gas and power and natural gas basis swaps at points for which over the counter otc broker quotes are available 
the fair value of electricity positions recorded above use the midpoint of the bid ask spreads obtained through otc brokers 
on average  otc quotes for forwards and swaps of natural gas and power extend one and two years into the future 
the prices based on models and other valuation methods category includes the value of transactions for which an internally developed price curve was constructed as a result of the long dated nature of the transaction or the illiquidity of the market point  or the value of options not quoted by an exchange or otc broker 
because of ppl energy supply s efforts to hedge the value of the energy from its generation assets  ppl energy supply sells electricity and buys fuel on a forward basis  resulting in open contractual positions 
if ppl energy supply were unable to deliver firm capacity and energy or to accept the delivery of fuel under its agreements  under certain circumstances it could be required to pay damages 
these damages would be based on the difference between the market price and the contract price of the commodity 
depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets  such damages could be significant 
extreme weather conditions  unplanned power plant outages  transmission disruptions  non performance by counterparties or their own counterparties with which it has energy contracts and other factors could affect ppl energy supply s ability to meet its obligations  or cause significant increases in the market price of replacement energy 
although ppl energy supply attempts to mitigate these risks  there can be no assurance that it will be able to fully meet its firm obligations  that it will not be required to pay damages for failure to perform  or that it will not experience counterparty non performance in the future 
as of december   ppl energy supply estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its non trading portfolio by approximately million  compared with a decrease of million at december  for purposes of this calculation  an increase in the market price for electricity is considered an adverse movement because ppl energy supply s electricity portfolio is generally in a net sales position  and a decrease in the market price for fuel is considered an adverse movement because ppl energy supply s commodity fuels portfolio is generally in a net purchase position 
ppl energy supply enters into those commodity contracts to reduce the market risk inherent in the generation of electricity 
in accordance with its marketing strategy  ppl energy supply does not completely hedge its generation output or fuel requirements 
ppl energy supply estimates that for its entire portfolio  including all generation  emissions and physical and financial energy positions  a adverse change in power prices across all geographic zones and time periods would decrease expected gross margins by million 
similarly  a adverse movement in all fossil fuel prices would decrease gross margins by million 
commodity price risk trading ppl energy supply also executes energy contracts to take advantage of market opportunities 
as a result  ppl energy supply may at times create a net open position in its portfolio that could result in significant losses if prices do not move in the manner or direction anticipated 
the margins from these trading activities are shown in the statement of income as net energy trading margins

as of december   ppl energy supply estimated that a adverse movement in market prices across all geographic areas and time periods would have decreased the value of the commodity contracts in its trading portfolio by million  compared with a decrease of million at december  interest rate risk ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries have issued debt to finance their operations 
ppl manages interest rate risk for ppl energy supply by using various financial derivative products to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in its debt portfolio  adjust the duration of its debt portfolio and lock in us treasury rates and interest rate spreads over treasuries in anticipation of future financing  when appropriate 
risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of ppl energy supply s debt portfolio due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   ppl energy supply s potential annual exposure to increased interest expense  based on a increase in interest rates  was estimated at million  compared with million at december  ppl energy supply is also exposed to changes in the fair value of its domestic and international debt portfolios 
at december   ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of its debt portfolio  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared with million at december  ppl and ppl energy supply utilize various risk management instruments to reduce ppl energy supply s exposure to the expected future cash flow variability of its debt instruments 
these risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financing 
while ppl energy supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments  any changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in equity and then reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings 
at december   the market value of these instruments  representing the amount ppl energy supply would receive upon their termination  was approximately million 
at december   ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in the hedged exposure  was million 
at december   ppl energy supply had none of these instruments outstanding 
ppl and ppl energy supply also utilize various risk management instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in ppl energy supply s debt portfolio 
while ppl energy supply is exposed to changes in the fair value of these instruments  any change in market value is recorded with an equal and offsetting change in the value of the debt being hedged 
at december   ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the fair value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in interest rates  was approximately million  compared with an exposure of million at december foreign currency risk ppl energy supply is exposed to foreign currency risk  primarily through investments in affiliates in the uk and latin america 
in addition  ppl energy supply may make purchases of equipment in currencies other than us dollars 
ppl has adopted a foreign currency risk management program designed to hedge certain foreign currency exposures  including firm commitments  recognized assets or liabilities and net investments 
in addition  ppl and ppl energy supply enter into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency translation risk 
to protect expected income in chilean pesos  ppl entered into an average rate forward for billion chilean pesos 
the settlement date of this forward is november at december   the market value of this position  representing the amount ppl would pay upon its termination  was insignificant 
ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the market value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in foreign exchange rates  was insignificant at december  wpdh limited holds a net position in cross currency swaps totaling billion to hedge the interest payments and value of its us dollar denominated bonds with maturity dates ranging from december to december the estimated value of this position at december   being the amount ppl would pay to terminate it  including accrued interest  was approximately million 
ppl energy supply estimated that its potential exposure to a change in the market value of these instruments  through a adverse movement in foreign exchange rates  was million at december  on the statement of income  gains and losses associated with hedges of interest payments denominated in foreign currencies are reflected in interest expense 
gains and losses associated with the purchase of equipment are reflected in depreciation 
gains and losses associated with net investment hedges remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss  a component of member s equity on the balance sheet  until the investment is disposed 
nuclear decommissioning trust funds securities price risk in connection with certain nrc requirements  ppl susquehanna maintains trust funds to fund certain costs of decommissioning the susquehanna station 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed rate  fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on ppl energy supply s balance sheet 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund susquehanna s decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs 
however  the equity securities included in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuation in equity markets  and the values of fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ppl susquehanna actively monitors the investment performance and periodically reviews asset allocation in accordance with its nuclear decommissioning trust policy statement 
at december   a hypothetical increase in interest rates and a decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an estimated million reduction in the fair value of the trust assets  compared with a million reduction at december see note to the financial statements for more information regarding the nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
synthetic fuel tax credit risk recent increases in and the volatility of crude oil prices threaten to reduce the amount of synthetic fuel tax credits that ppl energy supply expects to receive through its synthetic fuel production 
the tax credits are reduced if the annual average wellhead price of domestic crude oil falls within a phase out range 
the tax credits are eliminated if this reference price exceeds the phase out range 
see regulatory issues irs synthetic fuels tax credits in note to the financial statements for more information regarding the phase out of the tax credits 
ppl energy supply implemented a risk management objective to hedge a portion of the variability of cash flows associated with its and synthetic fuel tax credits by hedging the risk that the and annual average wellhead price for domestic crude oil will be within the phase out range 
ppl energy supply purchased options in to mitigate some of the reductions in synthetic fuel tax credits if the annual average wellhead price for and falls within the applicable phase out range 
these positions did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
the mark to market value of these positions as of december   was a gain of million  and is reflected in energy related businesses revenues on the statement of income 
as of december   ppl energy supply estimated that a adverse movement in market prices of crude oil would have decreased the value of the synthetic fuel hedges by million 
for purposes of this calculation  a decrease in the market price for crude oil is considered an adverse movement 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that ppl energy supply would incur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
ppl energy supply maintains credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparties including requirements that counterparties maintain certain credit ratings criteria and requires other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk 
however  ppl energy supply has concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities  natural gas distribution companies and other energy marketing and trading companies 
these concentrations of counterparties may impact ppl energy supply s overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic  regulatory or other conditions 
as discussed above in contract valuation  ppl energy supply records certain non performance reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty with contracts that are out of the money from the counterparty s standpoint will default in its performance 
in this case  ppl energy supply would have to sell into a lower priced market or purchase from a higher priced market 
these reserves are reflected in the fair value of assets recorded in price risk management assets on the balance sheet 
ppl energy supply also records reserves to reflect the probability that a counterparty will not make payments for deliveries ppl energy supply has made but not yet billed 
these reserves are reflected in unbilled revenues on the balance sheet 
ppl energy supply also has established a reserve with respect to certain sales to the california iso for which ppl energy supply has not yet been paid  as well as a reserve related to ppl energy supply s exposure as a result of the enron bankruptcy  which are reflected in accounts receivable on the balance sheet

 pension and other postretirement benefits as described in note to the financial statements  ppl energy supply subsidiaries sponsor various pension and other postretirement plans and participate in  and are allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic pension cost of the ppl retirement plan and the ppl postretirement benefit plan 
ppl and ppl energy supply follow the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these pension and other postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
the objective  in selecting the  discount rate is to measure the single amount that  if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs ppl energy supply records currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting a discount rate for its domestic pension and other postretirement plans  ppl energy supply starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans 
this information is first matched against a spot rate yield curve 
a portfolio of nearly moody s aa graded non callable corporate bonds  with a total outstanding float in excess of billion  serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve 
the results of this analysis are considered in conjunction with other economic data and consideration of movements in the moody s aa bond index to determine the discount rate assumption 
at december   ppl energy supply decreased the discount rate for its domestic plans from to as a result of this assessment 
the selection of a discount rate for the international pension plans of wpd again starts with an analysis of the expected benefit payment streams 
this information is analyzed against yields on long term high quality corporate bonds within the iboxx index 
due to the flatness of uk yield curves  the duration weighted discount rate is approximately the same 
at december  ppl energy supply decreased the discount rate for its international pension plans from to as a result of this assessment 
in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl and ppl energy supply consider tax implications  past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans 
at december   ppl s and ppl energy supply s expected return on plan assets was decreased from to for their domestic pension plans 
for its international plans  ppl energy supply s expected return on plan assets was reduced from to at december both ppl s and ppl energy supply s domestic and international pension plans have significantly exceeded the expected return on plan assets for and however  the expected return on plan assets assumption was decreased to reflect a long term view of equity markets and an expected increase in long term bond yields 
in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl and ppl energy supply consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl s and ppl energy supply s rate of compensation increase was changed to from for their domestic plans 
for the international plans  the rate of compensation increase remained at at december  in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl and ppl energy supply consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december   the health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on projected benefit obligations  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and other comprehensive income oci 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities in the financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions 
while the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  the inverse of this change would impact the projected benefit obligation  accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities  reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost and oci by a similar amount in the opposite direction 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
increase decrease actuarial assumption change in assumption impact on obligation impact on liabilities a impact on cost impact on oci discount rate expected return on plan assets n a rate of compensation increase health care cost trend rate b n a a excludes the impact of additional minimum liability 
b only impacts other postretirement benefits 
the total net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation for ppl energy supply s plans was million as of december  ppl energy supply recognized an aggregate net accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liability of million on its balance sheet as of december   for its plans 
the total obligation is not fully reflected in the current financial statements due to the delayed recognition criteria of the accounting standards for these obligations 
at december   ppl energy supply also reflected a net liability of million on its balance sheet for pension liabilities and prepaid other postretirement benefit costs allocated from plans sponsored by ppl services 
in ppl energy supply was allocated and recognized net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged to operating expenses of million 
this amount represents a million increase compared with the credit recognized during this increase in expense was primarily attributable to ppl s international plans and was the result of the decrease in the discount rate at december   and recognition of prior losses 
the pension plans of wpd have accumulated deferred losses of million as of december   as a result of changes in the discount rate assumption  expected compared with actual asset returns and changes in demographic assumptions and experience  the losses  to the extent not offset by future gains  will be amortized in accordance with ppl energy supply s policy regarding recognition of gains and losses as detailed in note to the financial statements 
strong asset returns and falling foreign currency conversion rates offset the impact of the decrease in the discount rate  allowing ppl energy supply to reduce its additional minimum pension liability for its international pension plans  offset by a modest increase for it s domestic pension plans 
recording the change in the additional minimum liability resulted in a million decrease to the pension related charge to oci  net of taxes  translation adjustment and unrecognized prior service costs  with no effect on net income 
the pension related balance in oci  which is a reduction to shareowners equity  was reduced from million at december   to million at december the charges to oci will reverse in future periods if the fair value of trust assets exceeds the accumulated benefit obligation

 asset impairment ppl energy supply performs impairment analyses for long lived assets  including intangibles  that are subject to depreciation or amortization in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
ppl energy supply tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long lived asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances are a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for a long lived asset  an impairment exists when the carrying value exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the asset is impaired  an impairment loss is recorded to adjust the asset s carrying value to its estimated fair value 
in determining asset impairments  management must make significant judgments to estimate future cash flows  the useful lives of long lived assets  the fair value of the assets and management s intent to use the assets 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the impairment reviews could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
for determining fair value  the fasb has indicated that quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value 
however  when market prices are unavailable  other valuation techniques may be used 
ppl energy supply has generally used a present value technique ie  discounted cash flow 
discounted cash flow is calculated by estimating future cash flow streams and applying appropriate discount rates to determine the present value of the cash flow streams 
ppl energy supply has determined that  when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying value of a long lived asset are being considered  it uses estimated cash flows from the most likely approach to assess impairment whenever one scenario is clearly the most likely outcome 
if no scenario is clearly most likely  then a probability weighted approach is used taking into consideration estimated cash flows from the alternative scenarios 
for assets tested for impairment as of the balance sheet date  the estimates of future cash flows used in that test consider the likelihood of possible outcomes that existed at the balance sheet date  including the assessment of the likelihood of the future sale of the assets 
that assessment made as of the balance sheet date is not revised based on events that occur after the balance sheet date 
during  ppl energy supply and its subsidiaries evaluated certain gas fired generation assets for impairment  as events and circumstances indicated that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
ppl energy supply did not record an impairment of these gas fired generation assets in for these impairment analyses  the most significant assumption was the estimate of future cash flows 
ppl energy supply estimates future cash flows using information from its corporate business plan adjusted for any recent sale or purchase commitments 
key factors that impact cash flows include projected prices for electricity and gas as well as firm sale and purchase commitments 
a decrease in estimated future cash flows for the gas fired generation assets would not have resulted in an impairment charge 
ppl energy supply performs impairment analyses for goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
ppl energy supply performs an annual impairment test for goodwill  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
sfas requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level 
ppl energy supply has determined its reporting units to be one level below its operating segments 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill in a business combination 
that is  the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared with the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
ppl energy supply completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of this test did not require any second step assessments and did not result in any impairments 
ppl energy supply s most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values 
ppl energy supply estimated fair values primarily based upon discounted cash flows 
although a full two step evaluation was not completed  a decrease in the forecasted cash flows of or an increase of the discount rates by basis points would have resulted in the carrying value of certain reporting units exceeding their estimated fair values  indicating a potential impairment of goodwill 
 leasing ppl energy supply applies the provisions of sfas  accounting for leases  to all leasing transactions 
in addition  ppl energy supply applies the provisions of numerous other accounting pronouncements issued by the fasb and the eitf that provide specific guidance and additional requirements related to accounting for various leasing arrangements 
in general  there are two types of leases from a lessee s perspective operating leases leases accounted for off balance sheet  and capital leases leases capitalized on the balance sheet 
in accounting for leases  management makes various assumptions  including the discount rate  the fair market value of the leased assets and the estimated useful life  in determining whether a lease should be classified as operating or capital 
changes in these assumptions could result in the difference between whether a lease is determined to be an operating lease or a capital lease  thus significantly impacting the amounts to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition to uncertainty inherent in management s assumptions  leasing transactions and the related accounting rules become increasingly complex when they involve real estate and or related integral equipment  sale leaseback accounting leasing transactions where the lessee previously owned the leased assets  synthetic leases leases that qualify for operating lease treatment for book accounting purposes and financing treatment for tax accounting purposes  and lessee involvement in the construction of leased assets 
at december   ppl energy supply continued to participate in a significant sale leaseback transaction 
in july  ppl montana sold its interest in the colstrip generating plant to owner lessors who are leasing the assets back to ppl montana under four year operating leases 
this transaction is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with current rules related to sale leaseback arrangements 
if for any reason this transaction did not meet the requirements for off balance sheet operating lease treatment as a sale leaseback  ppl energy supply would have recorded approximately million of additional assets and approximately million of additional liabilities on its balance sheet at december   and would have recorded additional expenses currently estimated at million  after tax  in see note to the financial statements for additional information related to operating leases 
 loss accruals ppl energy supply periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl energy supply s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies  and other related accounting guidance 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
ppl energy supply continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  income taxes  regulatory penalties and other events 
ppl energy supply also has accrued estimated losses on long term purchase commitments when significant events have occurred 
for example  estimated losses were accrued when long term purchase commitments were assumed under asset acquisition agreements and when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
under regulatory accounting  ppl electric recorded the above market cost of energy purchases from nugs as part of its purchased power costs on an as incurred basis  since these costs were recovered in regulated rates 
when the generation business was deregulated  the estimated loss associated with these long term purchase commitments to make above market nug purchases was recorded because ppl electric was committed to purchase electricity at above market prices but it could no longer recover these costs in regulated rates 
as described below  this loss accrual was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july  corporate realignment 
the accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include the initial identification and recording of the loss  the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual  and the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient 
all three of these aspects of accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by ppl energy supply s management 
initial identification and recording of the loss accrual ppl energy supply uses its internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
in a loss accrual was recorded for the remediation expenses in connection with the ash basin leak at the martins creek generating station 
significant judgment was required by ppl energy supply s management to perform the initial assessment of this contingency 
in august  a leak from a disposal basin containing fly ash and water at the martins creek generating station caused a discharge from the basin onto adjacent roadways and fields  and into a nearby creek and the delaware river 
ppl energy supply immediately began to work with the pennsylvania dep and appropriate agencies and consultants to assess the extent of environmental damage caused by the discharge and to remediate the damage 
at that time  ppl energy supply had  and still has  no reason to believe that the martins creek leak has caused any danger to human health or any adverse biological impact on the river aquatic life 
however  at that time  ppl energy supply expected that it would be subject to an enforcement action by the pennsylvania dep and that claims may be brought against it by several state agencies and private litigants 
see note to the financial statements for additional information 
ppl energy supply s management assessed the contingency in the third quarter of the ultimate cost of the remediation effort was difficult to estimate due to a number of uncertainties  such as the scope of the project  the impact of weather conditions on the ash recovery effort  and the ultimate outcome of enforcement actions and private litigation 
ppl energy supply s management concluded  at the time  that million was the best estimate of the cost of the remediation effort 
ppl energy supply recorded this loss accrual in the third quarter of see ongoing assessment of recorded loss accruals for a discussion of the year end assessment of this contingency 
ppl energy supply has identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss  but that do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
the fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas reducing recorded loss accruals when an estimated loss is accrued  ppl energy supply identifies  where applicable  the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred  or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals certain loss accruals are systematically reduced based on the expiration of contract terms 
an example of this is the loss accrual for above market nug purchase commitments  which is described below 
this loss accrual is being reduced over the lives of the nug purchase contracts 
allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted or when underlying amounts are ultimately collected 
environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and ppl energy supply makes actual payments or the loss is no longer considered probable 
the largest loss accrual on ppl energy supply s balance sheet  and the loss accrual that changed most significantly in  was for an impairment of above market nug purchase commitments 
this loss accrual reflects the estimated difference between the above market contract terms  under the purchase commitments  and the fair value of the electricity to be purchased 
this loss accrual was originally recorded at million in  when ppl electric s generation business was deregulated 
when the loss accrual related to nug purchases was recorded in  ppl electric established the triggering events for when the loss accrual would be reduced 
a schedule was established to reduce the liability based on projected purchases over the lives of the nug contracts 
this loss accrual was transferred to ppl energyplus in the july  corporate realignment 
ppl energyplus continues to reduce the above market nug liability based on the aforementioned schedule 
as ppl energyplus reduces the liability for the above market nug purchases  it offsets the actual cost of nug purchases  thereby bringing the net power purchase expense more in line with expected market prices 
the above market loss accrual was million at december  this loss accrual will be significantly reduced by  when all but one of the nug contracts expires 
the then remaining nug contract will expire in ongoing assessment of recorded loss accruals ppl energy supply reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient 
this involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  operation management and other parties 
significant management judgment is required in developing ppl energy supply s contingencies  or reserves  for income taxes and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the ongoing assessment of tax contingencies is intended to result in management s best estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for each tax year 
annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities 
however  the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised by such authorities may differ from the amount accrued 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  ppl energy supply accounts for changes in probable exposures based on management s best estimate of the amount that should be recognized 
an allowance is maintained for the tax contingencies  the balance of which management believes to be adequate 
the ongoing assessment of valuation allowances is based on an assessment of whether deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized 
management considers a number of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets  including forecasts of taxable income in future periods 
as part of the year end preparation of its financial statements  ppl energy supply s management re assessed the loss accrual related to the ash basin leak at martins creek  described above under initial identification and recording of the loss accrual 
based on the ongoing remediation efforts and communications with the pennsylvania dep and other appropriate agencies  ppl energy supply s management concluded that million was currently the best estimate of the cost of the remediation effort 
therefore  ppl energy supply revised the loss accrual in the fourth quarter of see note to the financial statements for additional information 
ppl energy supply cannot predict the final cost of assessment and remediation of the leak  the outcome of the action initiated by the pennsylvania dep or the action initiated by the delaware riverside conservancy and several citizens  the outcome of the natural resource damage assessment  the exact nature of any other regulatory or other legal actions that may be initiated against ppl energy supply as a result of the disposal basin leak  the extent of the fines or damages that may be sought in connection with any such actions or the ultimate financial impact on ppl energy supply 
ppl energy supply s management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency in future periods 
 asset retirement obligations sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized as a liability in the financial statements 
the initial obligation should be measured at the estimated fair value 
an equivalent amount should be recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
until the obligation is settled  the liability should be increased  through the recognition of accretion expense in the income statement  for changes in the obligation due to the passage of time 
fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which was issued in march  and adopted by ppl effective december   clarified the term conditional aro as used in sfas fin specified that a conditional aro must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the aro can be reasonably estimated 
see note for further discussion of the impact of fin on ppl energy supply 
in determining aros  management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value 
fair value is developed through consideration of estimated retirement costs in today s dollars  inflated to the anticipated retirement date and then discounted back to the date the aro was incurred 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of aros could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements 
at december   ppl energy supply had aros totaling million recorded on the balance sheet 
ppl energy supply s most significant assumptions surrounding aros are the forecasted retirement costs  the discount rates and the inflation rates 
a variance in the forecasted retirement costs  the discount rates or the inflation rates could have a significant impact on the aro liabilities 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities related to the aro liabilities as of december   associated with a change in these assumptions at the time of initial recognition 
there is no significant change to the aro asset values  depreciation expense of the aro assets or accretion expense of the aro liabilities as a result of changing the assumptions 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
change in assumption impact on aro liabilities retirement cost discount rate inflation rate other information ppl s audit committee has approved the independent auditor to provide audit and audit related services and other services permitted by the sarbanes oxley act of and sec rules

ppl electric utilities corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ppl electric provides electricity delivery service in eastern and central pennsylvania 
its headquarters are in allentown  pa 
see item business background  for a description of ppl electric s business 
ppl electric s strategy and principal challenge is to own and operate its electricity delivery business at the highest level of customer service and reliability and at the most efficient cost 
ppl electric s electricity delivery business is rate regulated 
accordingly  ppl electric is subject to regulatory risks in terms of the costs that it may recover and the investment returns that it may collect in customer rates 
a key challenge for ppl electric is to maintain a strong credit profile 
investors  analysts and rating agencies that follow companies in the energy industry continue to be focused on the credit quality and liquidity position of these companies 
ppl electric continually focuses on strengthening its balance sheet and improving its liquidity position  thereby improving its credit profile 
see item a 
risk factors for more information concerning material risks ppl electric faces in its business 
the purpose of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is to provide information concerning ppl electric s past and expected future performance in implementing the strategy and challenges mentioned above 
specifically results of operations provides an overview of ppl electric s operating results in  and  including a review of earnings 
it also provides a brief outlook for financial condition liquidity and capital resources provides an analysis of ppl electric s liquidity position and credit profile  including its sources of cash including bank credit facilities and sources of operating cash flow and uses of cash including contractual commitments and capital expenditure requirements and the key risks and uncertainties that impact ppl electric s past and future liquidity position and financial condition

ppl electric s earnings were impacted by a number of key factors  including in december  the puc approved an increase in ppl electric s distribution rates of approximately million based on a return on equity of  and approved ppl electric s proposed mechanism for collecting an additional million in transmission related charges  for a total annual increase of approximately million  effective january  delivery revenues also increased in compared with due to a increase in electricity delivery sales volumes 
in january  severe ice storms hit ppl electric s service territory 
as a result  ppl electric had to restore service to approximately  customers 
the total cost of restoring service  excluding capitalized costs and regular payroll expenses  was approximately million 
on february   ppl electric filed a petition with the puc for authority to defer and amortize for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes these storm costs 
on august   the puc issued an order granting ppl electric s petition subject to certain conditions  including i the puc s authorization of deferred accounting is not an assurance of future rate recovery of the storm costs  ii ppl electric must request recovery of the deferred storm costs in its next distribution base rate case  and iii ppl electric must begin immediately to expense the deferred storm costs on a ten year amortization schedule for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes 
as a result of the puc order and in accordance with sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  in the third quarter of  ppl electric deferred approximately million of its previously expensed storm costs 
the deferral was based on its assessment of the timing and likelihood of recovering the deferred costs in ppl electric s next distribution base rate case 
at this time  ppl electric cannot be certain that it will recover the storm costs  nor can it predict whether future incidents of severe weather will cause significant facility damage and service disruptions that would also result in significant costs 
operation and maintenance expense increased in compared with  primarily due to increased system reliability work and tree trimming costs

ppl electric is also expecting to experience increased operation and maintenance expenses in statement of income analysis operating revenues retail electric the increases in revenues from retail electric operations were attributable to vs 
vs 
plr electric generation supply electric delivery delivery and plr supply to ppl generation other the increase in revenues from retail electric operations for compared with was primarily due to higher plr revenues due to higher energy and capacity rates and a increase in volume  in part due to the return of customers previously served by alternate suppliers  and higher electric delivery revenues resulting from higher transmission and distribution customer rates effective january   and a increase in volume 
the increase in revenues from retail electric operations for compared with was primarily due to higher plr revenues due to higher energy and capacity rates and a increase in volume  in part due to the return of customers previously served by alternate suppliers  partially offset by lower electric delivery revenues due to a decrease in itc and ctc revenue as a result of lower itc rates  and several rate groups reaching their cap  and lower sales to ppl generation 
ppl generation s power plants began self supplying their station use in april  rather than taking supply from ppl electric 
wholesale electric ppl electric wholesale revenues were previously derived primarily from sales to municipalities 
the million decrease in wholesale electric revenues in compared with was due to the expiration of all municipal purchase power agreements at the end of january wholesale electric to affiliate ppl electric has a contract to sell to ppl energyplus the electricity that ppl electric purchases under contracts with nugs 
the million decrease in wholesale revenue to affiliate in compared with was primarily due to an unplanned outage at a nug facility during the second quarter of ppl electric therefore had less electricity to sell to ppl energyplus 
energy purchases energy purchases increased by million in compared with primarily due to the million accrual for the pjm billing dispute 
see note to the financial statements for additional information regarding the loss accrual recorded for the pjm billing dispute 
also  the increase reflects a million charge to load serving entities which began in may  retroactive to december this charge minimizes the revenue impacts to transmission owners that result from the integration of the midwest iso and pjm markets and will continue until march these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to an unplanned nug outage in the second quarter of energy purchases from affiliate energy purchases from affiliate increased by million in compared with and by million in compared with the increases reflect an increase in plr load  as well as higher prices for energy purchased under the power supply contracts with ppl energyplus that was needed to support the plr load

taxes  other than income in ppl electric reversed a million accrued liability for and purta taxes that had been accrued based on potential exposure in the proceedings regarding the susquehanna nuclear station tax assessment 
the rights of third party intervenors to further appeal expired in the reversal and a million increase in domestic gross receipts tax expense in are the primary reasons for the million increase in taxes  other than income  compared with the reversal of the purta tax liability is the primary reason for the million decrease in taxes  other than income in  compared with also contributing to the decrease was lower capital stock tax expense 
these decreases were partially offset by higher gross receipts tax expense 
workforce reduction see note to the financial statements for information on the million charge recorded in other income net see note to the financial statements for details of other income and deductions 
interest expense interest expense  including interest expense with affiliate  decreased by million in compared with and by million in compared with these decreases primarily reflect the net impact of long term debt retirements and new issuances 
over the past two years  million of long term debt retirements have occurred  while new issuances over the same period totaled million 
the decrease in was partially offset by million of interest accrued for the pjm billing dispute and million of additional interest paid on collateral held by ppl electric relating to the plr contract 
see note to the financial statements for further discussion of collateral held under the plr contract 
income taxes income tax expense increased by million in compared with this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in income tax expense related to higher pre tax book income  and a million reduction in tax benefits in related to federal and state income tax reserves that included a million decrease in tax benefits associated with stranded costs securitization  offset by a million increase in tax benefits associated with other income tax reserves  predicated upon management s reassessment of its best estimate of probable tax exposure relative to income tax expense decreased by million in compared with this decrease was primarily attributable to a million tax benefit recognized in related to a reduction in tax reserves associated with stranded costs securitization predicated upon management s reassessment of its best estimate of probable tax exposure relative to  offset by a million increase in income tax expense related to higher pre tax book income 
annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities 
however  the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised by such authorities may differ materially from the amount accrued 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  ppl electric accounts for changes in probable exposures based on management s best estimate of the amount that should be recognized 
an allowance is maintained for the tax contingencies  the balance of which management believes to be adequate 
during  ppl electric reached partial settlement with the irs with respect to the tax years through and received a cash refund in the amount of million 
as a result of this settlement  the net tax impact recorded in was not significant 
see note to the financial statements for details on effective income tax rates and other income tax related matters 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources ppl electric is focused on maintaining an appropriate liquidity position and strengthening its balance sheet  thereby continuing to improve its credit profile 
ppl electric believes that its cash on hand  short term investments  operating cash flows  access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity  taken as a whole  provide sufficient resources to fund its ongoing operating requirements  future security maturities and estimated future capital expenditures 
ppl electric currently expects cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at the end of to be approximately million  while maintaining approximately million in credit facilities and up to million in short term debt capacity related to an asset backed commercial paper program 
however  ppl electric s cash flows from operations and its access to cost effective bank and capital markets are subject to risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to unusual or extreme weather that may damage ppl electric s transmission and distribution facilities or affect energy sales to customers  ability to recover and the timeliness and adequacy of recovery of costs associated with regulated utility businesses  any adverse outcome of legal proceedings and investigations currently being conducted with respect to ppl electric s current and past business activities  and a downgrade in ppl electric s or its subsidiary s credit ratings that could negatively affect their ability to access capital and increase the cost of maintaining credit facilities and any new debt 
at december   ppl electric had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in short term debt  compared with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of short term debt at december   and million in cash and cash equivalents and no short term investments or short term debt at december  the million of short term debt at december  and  is entirely from loan proceeds attributable to the asset backed commercial paper program  of which the full amount was used to cash collateralize letters of credit 
the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulted from net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million in compared with and increased by million in compared with  primarily as a result of receipts in of million in cash collateral related to the plr energy supply agreements and a federal income tax refund in the decrease for compared with was partially mitigated by the increase in distribution rates and transmission cost recoveries effective january  an important element supporting the stability of ppl electric s cash from operations is its long term purchase contracts with ppl energyplus 
these contracts provide sufficient energy for ppl electric to meet its plr obligation through  at the predetermined capped rates it is entitled to charge its customers over this period 
these contracts require cash collateral or other credit enhancement  or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement  in the event of adverse changes in market prices 
also under the contracts  ppl energy supply may request cash collateral or other credit enhancement  or reductions or terminations of a portion of the entire contract through cash settlement  in the event of a downgrade of ppl electric s credit ratings 
the maximum amount that ppl electric would have to post under these contracts is million  and ppl electric estimates that it would not have had to post any collateral if energy prices decreased by from year end or levels 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased by million in compared with  and increased by million in compared with  primarily as a result of initiating a million demand loan to an affiliate in the primary use of cash in investing activities is capital expenditures 
see forecasted uses of cash for detail regarding capital expenditures in and projected expenditures for the years through financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased by million in compared with  primarily due to a decrease of million in net debt retirements  partially offset by an increase of million in dividends paid to ppl corporation

new accounting standards see note to the financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards recently adopted or pending adoption 
application of critical accounting policies ppl electric s financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods  assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies 
the following accounting policies are particularly important to the financial condition or results of operations of ppl electric  and require estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain 
changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the financial statements 
these accounting policies are also discussed in note to the financial statements 
ppl s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions regarding them  with its audit committee 
in addition  ppl s senior management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 
 pension and other postretirement benefits as described in note to the financial statements  ppl electric participates in  and is allocated a significant portion of the liability and net periodic pension cost of the ppl retirement plan and the ppl postretirement benefit plan 
ppl follows the guidance of sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for a smoothed recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
the objective  in selecting the  discount rate is to measure the single amount that  if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of high quality debt instruments  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due 
expected return on plan assets management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance  but primarily based upon the plans mix of assets and expectations for the long term returns on those asset classes 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs ppl electric records currently 
rate of compensation increase management projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
health care cost trend rate management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 
in selecting discount rates  ppl considers the expected cash outflows of its plans matched against appropriate fixed income security yield rates 
this information is first matched against a spot rate yield curve 
a portfolio of nearly moody s aa graded non callable corporate bonds  with a total outstanding float in excess of billion  serves as the base from which those with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop the ultimate yield curve 
the results of this analysis are considered in conjunction with other economic data and consideration of movements in the moody s aa bond index to determine the discount rate assumption 
at december   ppl decreased the discount rate for its domestic plans from to as a result of decreased long duration fixed income security returns 
in selecting an expected return on plan assets  ppl considers tax implications  past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans 
at december   ppl s expected return on plan assets was decreased from to for its domestic pension plans and increased to from for its other postretirement benefit plans 
ppl s domestic pension plans have significantly exceeded the expected return on plan assets for and however  the expected return on plan assets assumption was decreased to reflect a long term view of equity markets and an expected increase in long term bond yields 
in selecting a rate of compensation increase  ppl considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december   ppl s rate of compensation increase was moved to from for its domestic plans 
in selecting health care cost trend rates  ppl considers past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
at december   ppl s health care cost trend rates were for  gradually declining to for a variance in the assumptions listed above could have a significant impact on the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost allocated to ppl electric 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities in the financial statements associated with a change in certain assumptions 
while the chart below reflects either an increase or decrease in each assumption  the inverse of this change would impact the accrued pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost by a similar amount in the opposite direction 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
increase decrease actuarial assumption change in assumption impact on liabilities impact on cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase at december   ppl electric s balance sheet reflected a net liability of million for pension liabilities and prepaid other postretirement benefit costs allocated from plans sponsored by ppl services 
in ppl electric was allocated net periodic pension and other postretirement costs charged to operating expense of million 
this amount represents a million increase compared with the charge recognized during this increase was primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate at december  refer to note to the financial statements for additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits 
 loss accruals ppl electric periodically accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and ppl electric s accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas  accounting for contingencies  and other related accounting guidance 
sfas defines a contingency as an existing condition  situation  or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to an enterprise that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
for loss contingencies  the loss must be accrued if information is available that indicates it is probable that the loss has been incurred  given the likelihood of the uncertain future events and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
fasb defines probable as cases in which the future event or events are likely to occur 
sfas does not permit the accrual of contingencies that might result in gains 
ppl electric continuously assesses potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation  litigation claims  income taxes  regulatory penalties and other events 
the accounting aspects of estimated loss accruals include the initial identification and recording of the loss  the determination of triggering events for reducing a recorded loss accrual  and the ongoing assessment as to whether a recorded loss accrual is sufficient 
all three of these aspects of accounting for loss accruals require significant judgment by ppl electric s management 
initial identification and recording of the loss accrual ppl electric uses its internal expertise and outside experts such as lawyers  tax specialists and engineers  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
in a significant loss accrual was recorded for the pjm billing dispute 
significant judgment was required by ppl electric s management to perform the initial assessment of this contingency 
in december  exelon corporation  on behalf of its subsidiary  peco energy  inc peco  filed a complaint against pjm and ppl electric with the ferc  alleging that pjm had overcharged peco from april through may as a result of an error by pjm 
the complaint requested the ferc  among other things  to direct ppl electric to refund to pjm million  plus interest of approximately million  and for pjm to refund these same amounts to peco 
in april  the ferc issued an order establishing hearing and settlement judge proceedings the order 
in the order  the ferc determined that peco was entitled to reimbursement for the transmission congestion charges that peco asserted pjm erroneously billed 
the ferc ordered settlement discussions  before a judge  to determine the amount of the overcharge to peco and the parties responsible for reimbursement to peco 
based on an evaluation of ferc s order  ppl electric s management concluded that it was probable that a loss had been incurred in connection with the pjm billing dispute 
ppl electric recorded a loss accrual of million  the amount of peco s claim  in the first quarter of see note to the financial statements for additional information 
see ongoing assessment of recorded loss accruals for a discussion of the year end assessment of this contingency 
ppl electric has identified certain other events that could give rise to a loss  but that do not meet the conditions for accrual under sfas sfas requires disclosure  but not a recording  of potential losses when it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred 
the fasb defines reasonably possible as cases in which the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely 
see note to the financial statements for disclosure of other potential loss contingencies that have not met the criteria for accrual under sfas reducing recorded loss accruals when an estimated loss is accrued  ppl electric identifies  where applicable  the triggering events for subsequently reducing the loss accrual 
the triggering events generally occur when the contingency has been resolved and the actual loss is incurred  or when the risk of loss has diminished or been eliminated 
the following are some of the triggering events that provide for the reduction of certain recorded loss accruals allowances for excess or obsolete inventory are reduced as the inventory items are pulled from the warehouse shelves and sold as scrap or otherwise disposed 
allowances for uncollectible accounts are reduced when accounts are written off after prescribed collection procedures have been exhausted or when underlying amounts are ultimately collected 
environmental and other litigation contingencies are reduced when the contingency is resolved and ppl electric makes actual payments or the loss is no longer considered probable 
ongoing assessment of recorded loss accruals ppl electric reviews its loss accruals on a regular basis to assure that the recorded potential loss exposures are sufficient 
this involves ongoing communication and analyses with internal and external legal counsel  engineers  tax specialists  operation management and other parties 
significant management judgment is required in developing ppl electric s contingencies  or reserves  for income taxes and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the ongoing assessment of tax contingencies is intended to result in management s best estimate of the ultimate settled tax position for each tax year 
annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns by taxing authorities 
however  the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of any issues raised by such authorities may differ from the amount accrued 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  ppl electric accounts for changes in probable exposures based on management s best estimate of the amount that should be recognized 
an allowance is maintained for the tax contingencies  the balance of which management believes to be adequate 
the ongoing assessment of valuation allowances is based on an assessment of whether deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized 
management considers a number of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets  including forecasts of taxable income in future periods 
as part of the year end preparation of its financial statements  ppl electric s management re assessed the loss accrual related to the pjm billing dispute  described above under initial identification and recording of the loss accrual 
in re assessing the pjm billing dispute  ppl electric s management considered the proposed settlement agreement that was filed with ferc in september under the settlement agreement  ppl electric would pay million plus interest over a four year period to pjm through a new transmission charge that  under applicable law  is recoverable from ppl electric s retail customers 
also  all pjm market participants would pay approximately million plus interest over a four year period to pjm through a new market adjustment charge 
pjm would forward amounts collected under the two new charges to peco 
see note to the financial statements for additional information 
numerous parties filed comments with the ferc opposing the settlement agreement  and the ferc has not yet acted on the proposed settlement agreement 
accordingly  ppl electric s management had no basis to revise the loss accrual that was recorded in the first quarter of ppl electric s management will continue to assess the loss accrual for this contingency for future periods
