the company reports operating segments based on the company s legal entities  which are organized by line of business property casualty insurance life insurance noninsurance consumer financing commercial leasing agency operations employee benefits administration corporate and eliminations property casualty insurance operations accounted for of revenues and of net income in life insurance operations generated of revenues and of net income during the same period 
noninsurance net income  combined with corporate expenses for  resulted in a net loss of million or of net income 
future results of operations will depend in part on the company s ability to predict and control benefit and settlement expenses through underwriting criteria  product design and negotiation of favorable vendor contracts 
the company must also seek timely and accurate rate changes from insurance regulators in order to meet strategic business objectives 
selection of insurable risks  proper collateralization of loans and leases and continued staff development also impact the operating results of the company 
the company s inability to mitigate any or all risks mentioned above or other factors may adversely affect its profitability 
in evaluating the performance of the company s segments  management believes operating income serves as a meaningful tool for assessing the profitability of the company s ongoing operations 
operating income  a non gaap financial measure  is defined by the company as net income excluding net realized investment gains and losses  net of applicable taxes 
realized investment gains and losses are somewhat controllable by the company through the timing of decisions to sell securities 
therefore  realized investment gains and losses are not indicative of future operating performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the company s management to make significant estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time the financial statements are prepared 
in addition  management must ascertain the appropriateness and timing of any changes in these estimates and assumptions 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the company s financial statements and because of the possibility that subsequent events and available information may differ markedly from management s judgments at the time financial statements are prepared 
for the company  the areas most subject to significant management judgments include reserves for property casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses  reserves for future policy benefits  deferred policy acquisition costs  valuation of investments  and reserves for pending litigation 
the application of these critical accounting estimates impacts the values at which 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of the company s assets and of the company s liabilities are reported at december  and therefore have a direct effect on net earnings and stockholders equity 
the company s summary of significant accounting policies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the company s critical accounting policies and estimates  together with any changes therein  with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the company s audit committee has also reviewed the disclosures contained herein 
reserves for property casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses the estimated liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses include the accumulation of estimates of losses for claims reported prior to the balance sheet dates  estimates of losses for claims incurred but not reported and the development of case reserves to ultimate values  and estimates of expenses for investigating  adjusting and settling all incurred claims 
amounts reported are estimates of the ultimate costs of settlement  net of estimated salvage and subrogation 
the estimates are necessarily subject to the outcome of future events  such as changes in medical and repair costs as well as economic  political and social conditions that impact the settlement of claims 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
due to the company s current mix of exposures  the majority of claims are settled within twelve months of the date of loss 
the amount of loss reserves for reported claims is based primarily upon a case by case evaluation of the risk involved  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each claim and the insurance policy provisions related to the type of loss 
the amounts of loss reserves for unreported claims and loss adjustment expenses are determined using historical information by line of business as adjusted to current conditions 
inflation is implicitly provided for in the reserving function through analysis of costs  trends and reviews of historical reserving results 
organized by accident year and evaluation dates  historical data on paid losses  loss adjustment expenses  case reserves  earned premium  catastrophe losses and carried reserves is provided to the company s actuaries who apply standard actuarial techniques to estimate a range of reasonable reserves 
the carried reserve is then compared to these estimates to determine whether it is reasonable and whether any adjustments need to be recorded 
the company s appointed actuary conducts his own analysis and renders an opinion as to the adequacy of the reserves 
reserve estimates are closely monitored and are rolled forward quarterly using the most recent information on reported claims 
each quarter  after the rolled forward analysis has been completed  a meeting is held to discuss the actuarial data 
management evaluates reserve level estimates across various segments and adjustments are made as deemed necessary 
it is expected that such estimates will be more or less than the amounts ultimately paid when the claims are settled 
changes in these estimates are reflected in current operating results 
an increase in the ending reserve for incurred but not reported losses of would have negatively impacted income before income taxes by  at december  similarly  increases of in the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses would have reduced pretax earnings by  and  respectively 
due to the company s geographically concentrated operations  it is possible that changes in assumptions based on regional data could cause fluctuations in reported results 
however  the company s exposure to large adjustments in these reserves created by these assumption changes is partially limited by its participation in alfa s catastrophe protection program 
historically  the company s reserves  in the aggregate  have been adequate when compared to actual results 
given the inherent variability in the estimates  management believes the aggregate reserves are within a reasonable and acceptable range of adequacy

index to financial statements reserves for policyholder benefits benefit reserves for traditional life products are determined according to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
the methodology used requires that the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums that portion of the gross premium required to provide for all future benefits and expenses be determined 
such determination uses assumptions  including provision for adverse deviation  for expected investment yields  mortality  terminations and maintenance expenses applicable at the time the insurance contracts are issued 
these assumptions determine the level and the sufficiency of reserves 
the company annually tests the validity of these assumptions 
benefit reserves for universal life products are determined according to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
this standard directs that  for policies with an explicit account balance  the benefit reserve is the account balance without reduction for any applicable surrender charge 
benefit reserves for the company s annuity products  like those for universal life products  are determined using the requirements of sfas no 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and the aicpa audit and accounting guide  credit insurance reserves are held as unearned premium reserves calculated using the rule of method 
reserves for supplementary contracts with life contingencies are determined using the individual annuity mortality table and an interest rate of 
likewise  reserves for accidental death benefits are determined predominately by using the accidental death benefit mortality table and an interest rate of 
reserves for disability benefits  both active and disabled lives  are calculated primarily from the disability study and a rate of 
a small portion of the company s disabled life reserves are calculated based on the intercompany group disability study and a rate of 
reserves for all other benefits are computed in accordance with presently accepted actuarial standards 
management believes that reserve amounts reflected in the company s balance sheet related to life products are consistently applied and fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles  are based on actuarial assumptions which are in accordance with contract provisions  make a good and sufficient provision for all unmatured obligations of the company guaranteed under the terms of its contracts  are computed on the basis of assumptions consistent with those used in computing the corresponding items of the preceding year end  and include provision for all actuarial reserves and related items that ought to be established 
valuation of investments unrealized investment gains or losses on investments carried at fair value  net of applicable income taxes  are reflected directly in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
fair values for fixed maturities are based on quoted market prices 
the cost of investment securities sold is determined by using the first in  first out methodology 
in some instances  the company may use the specific identification method 
the company monitors its investment portfolio and conducts quarterly reviews of investments that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
such evaluations involve judgment and consider the magnitude and reasons for a decline and the prospects for the fair value to recover in the near term 
declines resulting from broad market conditions 
table of contents 
index to financial statements or industry related events  and for which the company has the intent to hold the investment for a period of time believed to be sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  are considered to be temporary 
future adverse investment market conditions  or poor operating results of underlying investments  could result in an impairment charge in the future 
where a decline in fair value of an investment below its cost is deemed to be other than temporary  a charge is reflected in income for the difference between the cost or amortized cost and the estimated net realizable value 
as a result  writedowns of approximately million and million were recorded in on equity securities and fixed maturities  respectively 
during  writedowns of approximately  were recorded on fixed maturities with no writedowns on equity securities 
policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  premium taxes and certain other underwriting and marketing expenses that vary with and are directly related to the production of business have been deferred 
traditional life insurance acquisition costs are being amortized over the premium payment period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policy benefit reserves 
acquisition costs for universal life type policies are being amortized over a thirty year period in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits that are determined based upon surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
investment income is considered  if necessary  in the determination of the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
acquisition costs for property casualty insurance are amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
future changes in estimates  such as the relative time certain employees spend in initial policy bookings  may require adjustment to the amounts deferred 
changes in underwriting and policy issuance processes may also give rise to changes in these deferred costs 
reserves for litigation the company is subject to lawsuits in the normal course of business related to its insurance and noninsurance products 
at the time a lawsuit becomes known  management evaluates the merits of the case and determines the need for establishing estimated reserves for potential settlements or judgments as well as reserves for potential costs of defending the company against the allegations of the complaint 
these reserves may be adjusted as the case develops 
periodically  and at least quarterly  management assesses all pending cases as a basis for evaluating reserve levels 
at that point  any necessary adjustments are made to applicable reserves as determined by management and are included in current operating results 
reserves may be adjusted based upon outside counsels advice regarding the law and facts of the case  any revisions in the law applicable to the case  the results of depositions and or other forms of discovery  general developments as the case progresses such as a favorable or an adverse trial court ruling  whether a verdict is rendered for or against the company  whether management believes an appeal will be successful  or other factors that may affect the anticipated outcome of the case 
management believes adequate reserves have been established in known cases 
however  due to the uncertainty of future events  there can be no assurance that actual outcomes will not differ from the assessments made by management

at december   the company had unrealized gains in such investments of approximately  compared to approximately million at december  the company recognized a net gain of  on the disposal of high yield debt securities in after recognizing a net loss of  on similar disposals in it is the company s policy to write down securities for which declines in value have been deemed to be other than temporary 
the amount written down represents the difference between the cost or amortized cost and the fair value at the time of determining the security was impaired 
quarterly reviews are conducted by the company to ascertain which securities  if any  have become impaired in value 
investments in securities entail general market risk as well as company specific risk 
during  the company wrote down three bond issues totaling  and five equity securities totaling  for which declines in value were deemed to be other than temporary

at december   unrealized losses of approximately million existed on equity securities directly owned by the company 
of this amount  the greatest concentrations of gross unrealized losses were in the healthcare  information technology and consumer discretionary sectors where the company had losses of approximately million   and  respectively 
in assessing each security  the company analyzes the industry and earnings trends of the underlying issuer  the length of time the security has continuously been in a loss position  and the magnitude of the loss in comparison to its cost 
generally  the company writes down securities that have been continuously in a loss position of at least for six consecutive months 
in addition  management reviews the underlying causes for any significant loss position within the debt securities to determine if the item is impaired 
due to the subjectivity of the writedown process  there are risks and uncertainties that could impact the company s future earnings and financial position 
if recoveries in the price of securities fail to materialize  the company s earnings and financial position will be negatively impacted 
the company s investment philosophy is one that generally looks for long range growth based on the company s willingness and ability to hold investments for extended periods of time 
six equity securities had experienced a reduction in value of at least in value at the end of of these equity securities in loss positions   of the losses had been in loss positions for less than three months and  of the losses had been in loss positions for longer than three months but less than six months 
no fixed maturity had experienced a reduction in value of at least at the end of the company s general practice is to re evaluate any security written down on a periodic basis in order to determine whether additional impairment has occurred 
at december   the company held below investment grade fixed maturities with a cost of  and a fair value of  while these securities represent of both the cost and fair value of the company s total fixed maturity portfolio  only three of these investments were in an unrealized loss position

the company s investment in collateral loans and commercial leases consists primarily of consumer loans and commercial leases originated by the finance subsidiary 
the majority of the commercial lease portfolio was reclassified to assets classified as held for sale at december  and subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of automobiles  equipment and other property collateralize the company s loans and leases

the company periodically invests in affordable housing tax credit partnerships 
at december   the company had legal and binding commitments to fund partnerships of this type in the amount of approximately million

impact of inflation inflation increases consumers needs for both life and property casualty insurance coverage 
inflation increases claims incurred by property casualty insurers as property repairs  replacements and medical expenses increase 
such cost increases reduce profit margins to the extent that rate increases are not maintained on an adequate and timely basis 
since inflation has remained relatively low in recent years  financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation 
liquidity and capital resources the company receives funds from its subsidiaries consisting of dividends  payments for funding federal income taxes  and reimbursement of expenses incurred at the corporate level for the subsidiaries 
these funds are used for paying dividends to stockholders  corporate interest and expenses  federal income taxes  and for funding additional investments in its subsidiaries operations 
the company s subsidiaries require cash in order to fund policy acquisition costs  claims  other policy benefits  interest expense  general operating expenses  and dividends to the company 
the major sources of the subsidiaries liquidity are operations and cash provided by maturing or liquidated investments 
a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio consists of readily marketable securities that can be sold for cash 
based on a review of the company s matching of asset and liability maturities and on the interest sensitivity of the majority of policies inforce  management believes the ultimate exposure to loss from interest rate fluctuations is not significant 
in evaluating current and potential financial performance of any corporation  investors often wish to view the contractual obligations and commitments of the entity 
the company has a limited number of contractual obligations in the form of long term debt and leases 
these leases have primarily been originated by its insurance subsidiaries and vision 
operating leases supporting the corporate operations are the responsibility of mutual 
in turn  the company reimburses mutual monthly for a portion of these and other expenses based on a management and operating agreement 
there are currently no plans to change the structure of this agreement 
the company s contractual obligations at december  are summarized below payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases capital lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations notes payable to affiliates long term debt other long term obligations total contractual obligations 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the company maintains a variety of funding agreements in the form of lines of credit with affiliated entities

events leading to the call of a guarantee  the failure of the policy administration system being developed for use by the life insurance operations to perform properly and achievement of specific metrics by vision are examples of situations that would impact the financial position and results of the company 
net cash provided by operating activities approximated million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
such net positive cash flows provide the foundation of the company s assets liability management program and are the primary drivers of the company s liquidity 
as previously discussed  the company also maintains a diversified portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities that provide a secondary source of liquidity should net cash flows from operating activities prove inadequate to fund current operating needs 
management believes that such an eventuality is unlikely given the company s product mix primarily short duration personal lines property casualty products  its ability to adjust premium rates subject to regulatory oversight to reflect emerging loss and expense trends and its catastrophe reinsurance program  amongst other factors 
assessment of credit risk is a critical factor in the company s consumer loan and commercial leasing subsidiary 
all credit decisions are made by personnel trained to limit loss exposure from unfavorable risks 
in attempting to manage risk  the company regularly reviews delinquent accounts and adjusts reserves for potential loan losses and potential lease losses 
to the extent these reserves are inadequate at the time an account is written off  income would be negatively impacted 
in addition  the company monitors interest rates relative to the portfolio duration 
rising interest rates on commercial paper issued  the primary source of funding portfolio growth  could reduce the interest rate spread if the company failed to adequately adjust interest rates charged to customers 
total borrowings increased approximately million in to million 
the majority of the short term debt is commercial paper issued by the company 
at december   the company had approximately million in commercial paper at rates ranging from to with maturities ranging from january  to january  the company intends to continue to use the commercial paper program as a major source to fund the consumer loan portfolio and other corporate short term needs

the company is using the proceeds of this note to partially fund the consumer loan and commercial lease portfolios of its finance subsidiary 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap contract in order to achieve its objective of hedging percent of its variable rate long term interest payments over the first five years of the note 
under the interest rate swap  the company receives variable interest payments and makes fixed interest rate payments  thereby fixing the rate on such debt at 
on october   the company established a stock option plan the plan  pursuant to which a maximum aggregate of  shares of common stock have been reserved for grant to key personnel 
on april   the plan was amended to increase the maximum aggregate number of shares available for grant to  shares 
under the plan  options ratably become exercisable annually over three years and may not be exercised after ten years from the date of the award 
at december   there had been  options exercised   options were exercisable and  had been forfeited or expired 
during february  the company issued  nonqualified options under this plan 
the authority to grant the remaining  shares under the plan was terminated on april  by the stockholder approval of the alfa corporation amended and restated stock incentive plan the plan

during july  the company issued  nonqualified options under the plan 
in october  the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to  shares of its outstanding common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions in such quantities and at such times and prices as management may decide 
the board increased the number of shares authorized for repurchase by  in both march and september  bringing the total number of shares authorized for repurchase to  during  the company repurchased  shares at a cost of  refer to part ii  item purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchases

all share information presented in this section has been adjusted to reflect the impact of the two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend that was paid on june  due to the sensitivity of the products offered by the life subsidiary to interest rates fluctuations  the company must assess the risk of surrenders exceeding expectations factored into its pricing program

cash surrenders paid 
table of contents 
index to financial statements to policyholders on a statutory basis totaled million in both and this level of surrenders is within the company s pricing expectations 
historical persistency rates indicate a normal pattern of surrender activity in  and the structure of the surrender charges is such that persistency is encouraged 
the majority of the policies inforce have surrender charges which grade downward over a to year period 
at december   the total amount of cash that would be required to fund all amounts subject to surrender was approximately million 
the company s business is concentrated geographically in alabama  georgia and mississippi 
accordingly  unusually severe storms or other disasters in these contiguous states might have a more significant effect on the company s financial condition and operating results than on a more geographically diversified insurance company 
however  the company s catastrophe protection program  which began november   reduced the potential adverse impact and earnings volatility caused by such catastrophe exposures 
the company s management uses estimates in determining loss reserves for inclusion in its financial statements 
internal actuaries conduct periodic reviews to determine a range of reasonable loss reserves 
in addition  the company s catastrophe protection program  which began november   was established to address the economics of catastrophe finance 
this plan limits the company s exposure to catastrophes  which might otherwise deplete the company s surplus  through the sharing of catastrophe losses within the alfa group refer to note pooling agreement in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company supplements this plan with the purchases of reinsurance coverage from external reinsurers 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the company from its obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to the company  therefore  allowances are established if amounts are determined to be uncollectible 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions  activities  or economic characteristics of the reinsurance to minimize exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
at december   the company does not believe there to be a significant concentration of credit risk related to its reinsurance program 
lawsuits brought by policyholders or third party claimants can create volatility in the company s earnings 
the company maintains in house legal staff and  as needed  secures the services of external legal firms to present and protect its position 
certain legal proceedings are in process at december  these proceedings involve alleged breaches of contract  torts  including bad faith and fraud claims  and miscellaneous other causes of action 
these lawsuits involve claims for unspecified amounts of compensatory damages  mental anguish damages and punitive damages 
costs for these and similar proceedings  including accruals for outstanding cases  are included in the financial statements of the company 
management periodically reviews reserves established to cover potential costs of litigation including legal fees and potential damage assessments and adjusts them based on their best estimates 
it should be noted that in mississippi and alabama  where the company has substantial business  the likelihood of a judgment in any given suit  including a large mental anguish and or punitive damage award by a jury  bearing little or no relation to actual damages  continues to exist  creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse financial results 
increased public interest in the availability and affordability of insurance has prompted legislative  regulatory and judicial activity in several states 
this includes efforts to contain insurance prices  restrict underwriting practices and risk classifications  mandate rate reductions and refunds  eliminate or reduce exemptions from antitrust laws and generally expand regulation 
because of alabama s low automobile rates as compared to rates in most other states  the company does not expect the type of punitive legislation and initiatives found in some states to be a factor in its primary market in the immediate future 
in  the alabama legislature passed a tort reform package that has helped to curb some of the excessive litigation experienced in the late s

generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees and non employees  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on fair value at grant date 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
sfas r originally required adoption no later than july  in april  the securities and exchange commission sec issued a release that amends the compliance dates for sfas r 
under the sec s new rule  the company will be required to apply sfas r as of january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirement using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures  either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 
and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will impact the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position 
the company will share compensation cost with mutual based on the management and operating agreement refer to note related party transactions in the notes to consolidated financial statements

investment decisions are made by management and approved by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of securities 
the market risk related to the company s fixed maturity portfolio is primarily interest rate risk and prepayment risk 
the market risk related to the company s equity portfolio is equity price risk 
interest rate risk the company s fixed maturity investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in interest rates typically result in decreases and increases in the fair value of these financial instruments

the portfolio has an average effective duration of years and an average quality rating of aa the changes in the fair value of the fixed maturity available for sale portfolio are presented as a component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
the company works to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its fixed maturity portfolio 
the effective duration of the portfolio is managed to diversify its distribution
