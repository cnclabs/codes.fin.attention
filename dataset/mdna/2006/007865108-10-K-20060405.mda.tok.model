liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  the construction of new stores  the remodeling of existing stores  and to improve and enhance our information technology systems 
due to the seasonality of our business  we have historically realized a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities during the second half of the fiscal year 
most recently  our cash requirements have been met primarily through cash and cash equivalents on hand during the first half of the year  and through cash flows from operating activities during the second half of the year 
we expect to continue to meet our cash requirements primarily through cash flows from operating activities  existing cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments

investing activities we invested million in capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for the construction of new a ropostale stores and new jimmy z stores  to remodel existing stores  and for investments in information technology and for our distribution center 
our future capital requirements will depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and the timing of these expenditures 
we are planning to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal to open approximately to new a ropostale stores and up to new jimmy z stores  to remodel approximately existing stores  to update our existing point of sale systems  and for certain other information technology investments 
we had million in short term investments as of january   consisting of auction rate debt and preferred stock securities 
auction rate securities are term securities that earn income at a rate that is periodically reset  typically within days  to reflect current market conditions through an auction process 
as of january   these securities had contractual maturities ranging from through these securities are classified as available for sale securities under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
auction rate securities  which were previously recorded in cash and cash equivalents in our interim fiscal consolidated financial statements  have been included in short term investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
financing activities we repurchase our common stock from time to time under a stock repurchase program that was initiated in in november  our board of directors approved an additional million repurchase availability  thereby increasing the total amount of repurchase availability under this program to million 
the repurchase program may be modified or terminated by the board of directors at any time  and there is no expiration date for the program 
the extent and timing of repurchases will depend upon general business and market conditions  stock prices  and liquidity and capital resource requirements going forward 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal  and we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal as of january   we had repurchased a total of million shares for million since the inception of the repurchase program and had million of repurchase availability remaining under this million stock buy back program 
in april  we amended our revolving credit facility to allow us to borrow or obtain letters of credit up to at least an aggregate of million see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
the amount of available credit can be increased to an aggregate of million if we so request 
we had no amounts outstanding under the credit facility at either january   or january   and no stand by or commercial letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
in addition  we have not had outstanding borrowings under the credit facility since november 
table of contents we have not issued any letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventory or any capital expenditures 
inflation we do not believe that our sales revenue or operating results have been materially impacted by inflation during the past three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that our sales revenue or operating results will not be impacted by inflation in the future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations employment agreements event sponsorship agreement operating leases total contractual obligations the operating leases included in the above table do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal  or variable costs such as maintenance  insurance and taxes  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal our open purchase orders are cancelable without penalty and are therefore not included in the above table 
there were no commercial commitments outstanding as of january   nor have we provided any financial guarantees as of that date 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments set forth in the table above  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events that impact amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting estimates that include significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments would be made when facts and circumstances require 
historically  we have found our application of accounting estimates to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those estimated 

table of contents merchandise inventory merchandise inventory consists of finished goods and is valued utilizing the cost method at lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
we use estimates during interim periods to record a provision for inventory shortage 
we also make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable selling price in order to assess that our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions are based on both historical experience and current information 
we believe that the carrying value of merchandise inventory is appropriate as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a difference in our estimate to value inventory at lower of cost or market as of january  would have impacted net income by million for the fiscal year ended january  defined benefit pension plan we maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan  or serp  which is a non qualified defined benefit plan for certain officers 
the plan is non contributory  is not funded and provides benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment 
pension expense is determined using various actuarial cost methods to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to officers  and this cost is allocated to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the serp liability of million is appropriately stated as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
finite lived assets we periodically evaluate the need to recognize impairment losses relating to long lived assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or under performing business trends 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would write the asset down to fair value and we would record an impairment charge  accordingly 
we recorded an asset impairment charge of million during fiscal we believe that the carrying values of finite lived assets  and their useful lives  are appropriate as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  
table of contents including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
we record liabilities for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
tax contingency liabilities are adjusted for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties  such as significant amendments to existing tax law 
liabilities for tax contingencies were estimated at million as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments see the section recent accounting developments included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and we have not had any borrowings outstanding under our credit facility since november to the extent that we may borrow pursuant to our credit facility in the future  we may be exposed to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations
