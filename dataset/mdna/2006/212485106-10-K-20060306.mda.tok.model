during the past few years  we have been focused on transforming the segment into a leading player in the growing human resource outsourcing market 
in connection with our efforts to grow the business and build a global infrastructure of human resource expertise and know how  we have incurred significant start up costs 
furthermore  despite the fact that we have had recent success winning long term outsourcing arrangements with several clients  the sales cycles for these arrangements have ranged from twelve to twenty four months  which is longer than expected 
for these reasons  coupled with the fact that we are in the early stages with many of our outsourcing arrangements  where margins tend to be lower  we have generated significant operating losses over the past few years 
we believe that employee care is becoming a leading provider of global human resource services 
we recently signed long term human resource outsourcing arrangements with a number of large global companies and expect this momentum to continue

these positive operating income factors were partially offset by approximately in higher expenses incurred at customer care due to the continued weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
customer care serves a number of its us based clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to operate these non us contact centers is denominated in canadian dollars  indian rupees or philippine pesos  which represents a foreign exchange exposure 
during and  these currencies strengthened against the us dollar 
accordingly  the expenses of operating these contact centers  once translated into us dollars  have increased 
as discussed in further detail in the section titled market risk  we hedge this exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts and options 
the company realized approximately in gains from these hedges in both and in addition  the company s operating income in was negatively impacted by approximately in increased stock compensation expense  recorded at corporate  resulting from restricted stock units awarded pursuant to the company s long term incentive plan

second  customer care should experience improved profitability from top line growth with existing clients  recent clients ramps in the retail and healthcare markets and new client contracts 
finally  we expect significant growth in revenues from employee care 
this will be driven by revenues from a contract with the state of texas  which was fully implemented in the fourth quarter of  and several client programs that were signed in and are expected to be implemented in we expect that this revenue growth  along with slower growth in operating expense  should enable employee care to reduce its operating loss in by about half from these items will be partially offset by lower img revenues from cingular  higher expenses of approximately resulting from continued impact of the exchange rate of the canadian dollar versus us dollar and approximately of incremental stock compensation expense 
with respect to the first quarter of  we expect overall revenue and earnings growth compared to the first quarter of customer care revenues should increase approximately as a result of our expanded relationship with a large global industrial client

the decrease in operating cash flows versus was driven by changes in the amounts sold under the accounts receivables securitization program and the increase in receivables 
during  there was a net decrease in accounts receivables sold under the securitization program  whereas in  there was a net increase 
receivables  excluding the impact of the securitization  increased in  compared to a increase in this change was principally due to our revenue growth as well as slightly slower collection as dso increased to days at december   from days in the prior year 
cash flows from operating activities were also negatively impacted in due to a increase in other current assets  reflecting various items including increases in prepaid maintenance and insurance

as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company expects to contribute approximately to fund its cash balance pension plan in this compares to approximately in free cash flows  defined as cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of the accounts receivable securitization less capital expenditures net of proceeds related to disposal  were  and for  and  respectively 
in summary  the change to from was driven by stronger collections of receivables during and lower spending on capital expenditures  partially offset by payments made in for restructuring initiatives 
we use free cash flows  which is a non gaap financial measure  as an alternative measure of our ability to generate cash flows 
free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and should not be considered as being more important than its comparable gaap measure  net cash provided by operating activities 
we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful in addition to its comparable gaap measure because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets and excludes the impact of accounts receivable sold under the securitization agreement 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures  since it includes cash required for debt service 
a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is provided in the table at the beginning of this section

we were in compliance with all covenants throughout we have a accounts receivable securitization agreement with falcon asset securitization corporation and fifth third bank  under which we had sold no accounts receivable at december  the securitization agreement expires december in january  we executed an amendment to the securitization that eliminated certain restrictions pertaining to our ability to repurchase the receivables 
as a result of this amendment  transfers made under this agreement will no longer impact cash flows from operating activities 
accordingly  any future amounts transferred under this agreement will be treated as debt 
this amendment has no impact on our ability to utilize this facility for the full amount

as of december   the unpaid principal balance was as discussed more fully in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we lease certain facilities and equipment used in our operations under operating leases 
this includes our office complex in orlando  florida  which is leased from wachovia development corporation lessor  a wholly owned subsidiary of wachovia corporation  under an agreement that expires in june upon termination or expiration of the lease  we must either purchase the property from the lessor for  or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party 
if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount less than the  the amount paid by the lessor for the purchase of the complex from an unrelated third party  we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount in excess of  we are entitled to collect the excess 
at the inception of the lease  we recognized a liability of approximately for the related residual value guarantee 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents the value of the guarantee was determined by computing the estimated present value of probability weighted cash flows that might be expended under the guarantee 
we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the obligation with a corresponding asset recorded as prepaid rent  which is being amortized to rental expense over the lease term 
the liability will remain on the balance sheet until the end of the lease term 
under the terms of the lease  we also provide certain indemnities to the lessor  including environmental indemnities 
due to the nature of such potential obligations  it is not possible to estimate the maximum amount of such exposure or the fair value 
we do not expect such amounts  if any  to be material

we believe that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit facilities in place 
if market conditions change and we experience a significant decline in revenues  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
this could cause rating agencies to lower our credit ratings  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and ability to raise additional equity

market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  we expose ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which we enter into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   we had in outstanding variable rate borrowings 
the carrying amount of our borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
in connection with the december issuance of in unsecured senior notes that are due december   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of  which we designated as a hedge 
the purpose of the swap was to protect the notes against changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  we received interest at a fixed rate of and paid interest at a variable rate based on libor 
based on market conditions  we terminated this swap agreement on june  in connection with the settlement of the derivative instrument  we paid the counterparty  the fair value of the swap on june  the paid on the termination has been treated as a debt discount and  hence  is being amortized as interest expense over the term of the notes 
we also use  from time to time  cash flow hedges for interest rate exposure 
these instruments are hedges of forecasted transactions or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
there were no outstanding cash flow hedges covering interest rate exposure at december  based upon our exposure to variable rate borrowings  including amounts sold under the accounts receivable securitization  a one percentage point change in the weighted average interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately foreign currency exchange rate risk our customer care segment serves a number of our us based clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars cad  indian rupees inr or philippine pesos php  which represents a foreign exchange exposure 
in order to hedge the exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated into these foreign currencies  we have entered into forward contracts with several financial institutions to acquire a total of cad  inr  and php  at a fixed price of  and  respectively  through june additionally  the company had options to purchase approximately cad for a fixed price of through december the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december  is presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the potential loss in fair value at december   for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
other foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the company periodically enters into forward exchange contracts that are not convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect the company against foreign currency exposure pertaining to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of company or the respective subsidiaries

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments in these areas based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
we have identified below the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical in compiling our statements of financial condition and operating results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
goodwill at december   we had goodwill with a net carrying value of as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the second step requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  fair value is based on actual stock price or transaction prices of comparable companies 
the market approach requires significant judgment regarding the selection of comparable companies 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant judgment including estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
as required  we completed our annual impairment tests for our reporting units during the fourth quarter of based on the results of the first step  we had no goodwill impairment related to our four reporting units 
for three of the reporting units  the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value by a substantial amount 
if the discount rates used to value these reporting units increased by basis points  the outcome would have not changed 
on the other hand  with respect to our employee care reporting unit  a basis point increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a step one failure 
also  we would have failed step one if we decreased the operating margin  reflected in the valuation of employee care by basis points 
this would have required us to perform the second step of the impairment test as described above for the of goodwill recorded by this reporting unit 
we believe we make every reasonable effort to ensure that we accurately estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
however  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the recording of an impairment loss

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued deferred charges in connection with our client contracts  we from time to time incur direct and incremental costs  consisting principally of non refundable cash payments made to clients  to acquire or extend a contractual relationship 
to the extent recovery of these costs is probable  we capitalize these costs and amortize them ratably over the life of the contract as a reduction of revenue 
in connection with our img data processing and employee care outsourcing arrangements  we often must perform a significant amount of set up activities or implementations  which include the installation and customization of our proprietary software in our centers 
under these arrangements  clients do not take possession of the software nor have the right to take possession of the software without incurring a significant penalty 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  the implementations are not treated as separate elements for revenue recognition purposes 
any proceeds collected for the implementations are deferred and recognized over the service period 
additionally  with respect to certain multiple element arrangements  we defer all revenue related to the contracts until the final element is delivered 
we capitalize all direct and incremental implementation and multiple element costs  to the extent recovery is probable  and amortize them ratably over the life of the arrangements as costs of providing service 
at inception and throughout the term of the contract  we evaluate recoverability by considering profits to be earned during the term of the contract  the creditworthiness of the client and  if applicable  contract termination penalties payable by the client in the event that the client terminates the contract early 
our estimate of profitability is dependent in large part on our estimate of costs 
although we make every reasonable effort to accurately estimate costs  revisions may be made based on actual costs incurred that could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
additionally  if the financial condition of a client were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  we may be unable to recover the costs  which would result in an impairment loss 
finally  our entitlement to termination fees may be subject to challenge if a client were to allege that we were in breach of contract 
however  based on our evaluation of the related contracts  we believe that the of deferred charges is recoverable 
revenue recognition as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  revenue recognition is relatively straightforward for the vast majority of our revenue 
however  a portion of our revenues is derived from transactions that require a significant level of judgment 
this includes percentage of completion we recognize some software license and related professional and consulting revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
during  approximately of our consolidated revenues were recognized using the percentage of completion method 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of the costs of providing services 
as work convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
license arrangements approximately of our revenue was derived from license and support and maintenance arrangements 
the accounting for these arrangements can be complex and requires a significant amount of judgment 
some of the factors that we must assess include the separate elements of the arrangement  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various undelivered elements of the arrangement  whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  whether the fees are considered collectible and whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software 
multiple element outsourcing arrangements employee care  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  often delivers multiple services under our client arrangements eg  benefits administration  staffing  payroll and learning 
in connection with these arrangements  we must assess these multiple element arrangements to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis 
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are met  each of the contractual services included in the contract is treated as a separate unit of accounting 
if these criteria are not met  which has been the case for the majority of employee care contracts entered into to date  all of the services included are accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
revenue is then recognized either using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis once employee care begins to deliver the final service 
the assessments of these areas require a significant amount of judgment to be made by us 
the judgments made in these areas could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgment and estimates 
contingencies we consider the likelihood of various loss contingencies  including tax and legal contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business  and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of such a loss 
pursuant to sfas no 
 contingent liabilities  we accrue for a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
we have filed or are in the process of filing federal  state and foreign tax returns that are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
we are currently working to resolve tax audits related to prior years and various jurisdictions and anticipate the resolution of these audits in upcoming quarters 
we believe that we are adequately reserved in regards to these audits as of december  however  to the extent that ultimate resolutions vary from the amounts reserved  such impact would be recorded to the tax provision in the period in which such resolution is reached

as evidenced by the reversal of the restructuring accrual for facility abandonment costs that was recorded in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion  we will continue to evaluate our estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future

we serve clients in industries that have experienced a significant level of consolidation in recent years 
we cannot assure that additional consolidations will not occur in which our clients acquire additional businesses or are acquired 
such consolidations may result in the termination of an existing client contract  which would result in a decrease of our revenues 
in october  cingular completed its acquisition of at t wireless 
prior to the acquisition  at t wireless was our largest client in terms of revenue and a significant client for img and customer care 
with respect to img  we are assisting cingular with its strategy to migrate subscribers off of the at t wireless billing systems which we support onto cingular s two in house systems one of which we support by december  if the migration continues as planned  it will have a negative impact on img s revenues and earnings 
however  as evidenced by a contract extension signed in december  we expect to continue to support cingular s in house system 
our customer care segment also had a long standing relationship with at t wireless 
although revenues generated from this relationship were down significantly in compared to  volumes began to stabilize in the fourth quarter of we expect cingular to remain an important client to customer care 
however  should volume from cingular continue to decline  our customer care revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted 
in september  sprint pcs  a large img data processing outsourcing client  completed its acquisition of nextel communications 
the client recently informed us that it intends to consolidate its billing systems onto a competitor s platform 
at this point  sprint nextel s plan is to migrate subscribers from our billing system during and we will support sprint nextel with their migration efforts 
if the migration proceeds as planned  it will have a negative impact on img s revenues and earnings 
a large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients  and the loss of one or more of our clients could cause a reduction in our revenues 
we rely on several clients for a large percentage of our revenues 
our three largest clients  cingular  directv and sprint nextel  collectively represented of our revenues 
our relationship with cingular is represented by separate contracts work orders with various operating units across img and customer care operating units 
we serve directv under a customer care contract 
our relationship with sprint nextel is represented by separate contracts with img and customer care 
since february  we have provided customer care services to sprint nextel  for the sprint pcs division  under a contract between sprint nextel and ibm  whereby we serve as a subcontractor to ibm 
these separate contracts work orders with the above clients have varying expiration dates  payment provisions  termination provisions and other conditions 
as a result  we do not believe that it is likely that our entire relationship with cingular  directv or sprint nextel would terminate at one time  and  therefore  we are not substantially dependent on any particular contract work order with these clients 
however  the loss of all of the contracts work orders within a particular client at the same time or the loss of one or more of the larger contracts work orders with a client would adversely convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued affect our total revenues if the revenues from such client were not replaced with revenues from that client or other clients 
a large portion of our accounts receivable are payable by a limited number of clients and the inability of any of these clients to pay its accounts receivable could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
several significant clients account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable 
as of december   our three largest clients  cingular  directv and sprint nextel  collectively accounted for of our accounts receivable 
during the past three years  each of the clients set forth above has generally paid its accounts receivable on a timely basis  and write downs that we have incurred in connection with such accounts receivable were consistent with write downs that we incurred with other clients 
we anticipate that several clients will continue to account for a large percentage of accounts receivable 
although we currently do not expect payment issues with any of these clients  if any of them were unable  for any reason  to pay its accounts receivable  our income would decrease 
if our clients are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource and the prices that they are willing to pay for such services may diminish and could result in a reduction of our revenues 
our revenues depend on the success of our clients 
if our clients are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource may be diminished 
thus  although we have signed contracts  many of which contain minimum revenue commitments  to provide services to our clients  there can be no assurance that the level of revenues generated by such contracts will meet expectations 
in addition  several clients  particularly in the communications and technology industries  have experienced substantial price competition 
as a result  we may continue to face increasing price pressure from such clients  which could negatively affect our operating performance 
our failure to keep our technology up to date may prevent us from remaining competitive 
technology is a critical component of our success  including billing software products provided to a client through a license or data processing outsourcing arrangement or technology used by customer care or employee care agents in connection with outsourcing services 
in order to remain competitive  we need to continue to invest in the development of new and enhanced technology 
although we are committed to further investment in development  there can be no assurance that our technology will adequately meet our future needs or enable us to remain competitive 
our failure to keep our technology up to date may hinder our ability to remain competitive and may lead competitors to attract business from our existing and potential clients and cause our revenues to decrease 
defects or errors within our software products could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
design defects or software errors may delay product introductions or reduce the satisfaction level of clients and may have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our billing software products are highly complex and may  from time to time  contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and or correct 
since both we and our clients use our billing software products to perform critical business functions  design defects  software errors or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise from the use of our software 
it may also result in financial or other damages to our clients  for which we may be held responsible 
although our license agreements with our clients may often contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from client problems  these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents claims and liabilities arising from client problems could result in monetary damages to us and could cause damage to our reputation  adversely affecting our business  results of operations and financial condition 
emergency interruption of data centers and customer care and employee care contact centers could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our outsourcing operations depend on our ability to protect our proprietary software and client information maintained in our data processing  customer care and employee care contact centers against damage that may be caused by fire  natural disasters  power failure  telecommunications failures  computer viruses  acts of sabotage or terror and other emergencies 
in the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our data or contact centers  through casualty  operating malfunction or other acts  we may be unable to provide the data processing  customer care and employee care services we are contractually obligated to deliver 
this could result in us being required to pay contractual damages to some clients or allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts 
notwithstanding contingency plans and precautions instituted to protect our clients and us from events that could interrupt delivery of services including property and business interruption insurance that we maintain  there can be no guarantee that such interruptions would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide support services to our clients or that such precautions would adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur as a result of such interruptions 
if the global trend toward outsourcing does not continue  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
revenue growth depends in large part on the trend toward outsourcing  particularly as it relates to our customer care and employee care outsourcing operations 
outsourcing involves companies contracting with a third party  such as convergys  to provide customer care and employee care services rather than perform such services in house 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  as organizations may elect to perform such services in house 
a significant change in this trend could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during the past few years  we have been focused on transforming the employee care segment into a leading provider in the growing human resource outsourcing market 
although we have had recent success winning long term global human resource outsourcing arrangements with several clients  the sales cycles for large global human resource outsourcing arrangements have ranged from twelve to twenty four months 
the sales cycle is long  due to complexities associated with outsourcing human resource functions  including decisions regarding what functions to outsource  locations and timing of outsourcing 
this longer sales cycle can result in delays in the execution of the contracts  increase selling costs and have a negative impact on our revenues and operating results 
if we are unable to identify and complete appropriate acquisitions as we have since  we may not be able to grow at the same rate that we have since our growth has been enhanced through acquisitions of other businesses including their products  service offerings and licenses 
we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions 
if we are unable to make appropriate acquisitions on reasonable terms  whether for cash  convergys securities or both  it may be difficult for us to achieve the same level of growth as achieved since we are susceptible to business and political risks from domestic and international operations that could result in reduced revenues or earnings 
we operate businesses in many countries outside the united states  which are located throughout north and south america  europe  the middle east and the asian pacific region 
in connection with our strategy  we plan to convergys corporation annual report

additionally  north american companies have created a demand for offshore customer care outsourcing capacity 
as a result  we expect to continue expansion through start up operations and acquisitions in foreign countries 
expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional countries will require management attention and financial resources 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including exposure to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent that we are adversely affected by these risks  our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and or earnings could be reduced 
in addition  there have been political discussions and debate related to worldwide competitive sourcing  particularly from the united states to offshore locations 
federal and state legislation has been proposed that relates to this issue 
future legislation  if enacted  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if the us dollar does not strengthen  our earnings will continue to be negatively impacted 
customer care serves an increasing number of its us based customer care clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred by customer care to render services under these contracts is denominated in canadian dollars  indian rupees or philippine pesos  which represents a foreign exchange exposure to the company 
we enter into forward exchange contracts and options to limit potential foreign currency exposure 
as the us dollar weakened during and  the operating expenses of these contact centers  once translated into us dollars  increased in comparison to prior years 
the increase in operating expenses was offset partially by gains realized through the settlement of canadian dollar forward exchange contracts 
however  if the us dollar does not strengthen  the company s earnings will continue to be negatively impacted 
if we do not effectively manage our capacity  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to profit from the global trend toward outsourcing depends largely on how effectively we manage our customer care and employee care contact center capacity 
there are several factors and trends that have intensified the challenge of contact center management 
in order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects  we must consider opening new contact centers 
the opening or expansion of a contact center may result  at least in the short term  in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program 
we periodically assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our contact centers 
as a result  we may  if necessary  consolidate  close or partially close under performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity 
as part of our effort to consolidate our facilities  we seek to sublease a portion of that surplus space  if any  and recover certain costs associated with it 
to the extent that we fail to sublease such surplus space  our expenses will increase 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel in certain areas of our business  our ability to execute our business plans in those areas could be impaired and revenues could decrease 
we employ approximately  employees worldwide 
despite recent headcount reductions  we continue to recruit and hire qualified persons in the research and development  sales  marketing and administrative and services areas of our business 
at times  we have experi convergys corporation annual report

and enced difficulties in hiring personnel with the desired levels of training or experience 
additionally  particularly in regard to the labor intensive business of customer care and employee care  quality service depends on our ability to control personnel turnover 
any increase in the employee turnover rate could increase recruiting and training costs and decrease operating effectiveness and productivity 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain sufficient number of qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects 
this is particularly critical in connection with the execution of recent contracts signed by employee care 
because a significant portion of our operating costs relate to labor costs  an increase in wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
continued war and terrorist attacks or other civil disturbances could lead to economic weakness and could disrupt our operations resulting in a decrease of our revenues and earnings 
in march  the united states went to war against iraq and  in recent years  the united states  great britain and spain and other countries were targets of terrorist attacks 
these attacks have caused uncertainty in the global financial markets and in the united states economy 
the war and any additional terrorist attacks may lead to continued armed hostilities or further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may contribute to economic instability in the united states and disrupt our operations 
such disruptions could cause service interruptions or reduce the quality level of the services that we provide  resulting in a reduction of our revenues 
in addition  these activities may cause our clients to delay or defer decisions regarding their use of our services and  thus  delay receipt of additional revenues
