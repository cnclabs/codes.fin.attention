for state customers  the americhoice personal care model means increased access to care and improved quality  in a measurable system that reduces their administrative burden and lowers their costs 
americhoice considers a variety of factors in determining in which state programs to participate  including the state s experience and consistency of support for its medicaid program in terms of service innovation and funding  the population base in the state  the willingness of the physician provider community to participate with the americhoice personal care model  and the presence of community based organizations that can partner with americhoice to meet the needs of its members

table of contents government regulation most of our health and well being services are regulated 
this regulation can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
federal and state regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
federal regulation our health care services segment  which includes unitedhealthcare  ovations and americhoice  is subject to federal regulation 
ovations medicare business is regulated by cms 
cms has the right to audit performance to determine compliance with cms contracts and regulations and the quality of care being given to medicare beneficiaries 
our health care services segment also has medicaid and state children s health insurance program contracts that are subject to federal and state regulations regarding services to be provided to medicaid enrollees  payment for those services  and other aspects of these programs 
there are many regulations surrounding medicare and medicaid compliance 
in addition  because a portion of ingenix s business includes clinical research  it is subject to regulation by the food and drug administration 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations 
state regulation all of the states in which our subsidiaries offer insurance and health maintenance organization products regulate those products and operations 
these states require periodic financial reports and establish minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirements 
health plans and insurance companies are regulated under state insurance holding company regulations 
such regulations generally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports that describe capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain inter company transactions and general business operations 
some state insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval of acquisitions and material intercompany transfers of assets  as well as transactions between the regulated companies and their parent holding companies or affiliates 
in addition  some of our business and related activities may be subject to preferred provider organization ppo  managed care organization mco or third party administrator related regulations and licensure requirements 
these regulations differ from state to state  but may contain network  contracting  product and rate  financial and reporting requirements 
there are laws and regulations that set specific standards for delivery of services  payment of claims  fraud prevention  protection of consumer health information and covered benefits and services 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the applicable laws and regulations 
as typically occurs in connection with a transaction of this size  in connection with the pacificare transaction  certain of our subsidiaries entered into various commitments with state regulatory departments  principally in california 
we believe that none of these commitments will materially affect our operations 
hipaa the administrative simplification provisions of the health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended hipaa  apply to both the group and individual health insurance markets  including self funded employee benefit plans 
federal regulations promulgated pursuant to hipaa include minimum standards for electronic transactions and code sets  and for the privacy and security of protected health information 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these regulations 
new standards for national provider and employer identifiers are currently being implemented by regulators 
we have been and intend to remain in compliance in all material respects with these regulations 
additionally  different approaches to hipaa s provisions and varying enforcement philosophies in the different states may adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines 
erisa the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  regulates how goods and services are provided to or through certain types of employer sponsored health benefit plans 
erisa is a set of laws and 
table of contents regulations subject to periodic interpretation by the united states department of labor as well as the federal courts 
erisa places controls on how our business units may do business with employers who sponsor employee benefit health plans  particularly those that maintain self funded plans 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable erisa regulations 
audits and investigations we typically have and are currently involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits  and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments  state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  the department of justice and us attorneys 
such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
we do not believe the results of any of the current investigations  audits or reviews  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
international regulation some of our business units have limited international operations 
these international operations are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions  including various tax  tariff and trade regulations  as well as employment  intellectual property and investment rules and laws 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws 
competition as a diversified health and well being services company we operate in highly competitive markets 
our competitors include managed health care companies  insurance companies  third party administrators and business services outsourcing companies  health care providers that have formed networks to directly contract with employers  specialty benefit providers  government entities  and various health information and consulting companies

our specialized care services and ingenix business segments also compete with a number of other businesses 
new entrants into the markets in which we compete  as well as consolidation within these markets  also contribute to a competitive environment 
we believe the principal competitive factors that can impact our businesses relate to the sales and pricing of our products and services  product innovation  consumer satisfaction  the level and quality of products and services  care delivery  network capabilities  market share  product distribution systems  efficiency of administration operations  financial strength and marketplace reputation

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources at december  liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining strong financial flexibility and liquidity 
we forecast  analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceed our short term obligations in longer term  investment grade  marketable debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
factors we consider in making these investment decisions include our board of directors approved investment policy  regulatory limitations  return objectives  tax implications  risk tolerance and maturity dates 
our long term investments are also available for sale to meet short term liquidity and other needs 
cash in excess of the capital needs of our regulated entities are paid to their non regulated parent companies  typically in the form of dividends  for general corporate use  when and as permitted by applicable regulations 
our non regulated businesses also generate significant cash from operations for general corporate use 
cash flows generated by these entities  combined with the issuance of commercial paper  long term debt and the availability of committed credit facilities  further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility 
we generally use these cash flows to reinvest in our businesses in the form of capital expenditures  to expand the depth and breadth of our services through business acquisitions  and to repurchase shares of our common stock  depending on market conditions 
cash flows generated from operating activities  our primary source of liquidity  are principally from net earnings  prior to depreciation and amortization 
as a result  any future decline in our profitability may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
the level of profitability of our risk based insured business depends in large part on our ability to accurately predict and price for health care and operating cost increases 
this risk is partially mitigated by the diversity of our other businesses  the geographic diversity of our risk based business and our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes  which seek to match premium rate increases with future health care costs 
in  a hypothetical unexpected increase in commercial insured medical costs would have reduced net earnings by approximately million 
the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors  including our profitability  operating cash flows  debt levels  debt ratings  debt covenants and other contractual restrictions  regulatory requirements and market conditions 
we believe that our strategies and actions toward maintaining financial flexibility mitigate much of this risk 

table of contents cash and investments cash flows from operating activities were billion in  an increase over billion in the increase in operating cash flows resulted primarily from an increase of million in net income prior to depreciation  amortization and other noncash items partially offset by a decrease of million in cash flows generated from working capital changes 
we generated operating cash flows from working capital changes of million in and  million in the year over year decrease primarily resulted from the company receiving only eleven monthly medicare premium payments during from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms rather than the twelve monthly payments received in  negatively impacting the change in reported operating cash flows by million 
additionally  there was reduced growth in medical payables during compared to due in part to an increase in electronic claim submissions and other disbursement process efficiencies 
we maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position  with cash and investments of billion at december  total cash and investments increased by billion since december   primarily due to cash and investments acquired through businesses acquired since the beginning of  strong operating cash flows and cash received from debt issuances  partially offset by common stock repurchases  cash paid for business acquisitions and capital expenditures 
as further described under regulatory capital and dividend restrictions  many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
at december   approximately million of our billion of cash and investments was held by non regulated subsidiaries and available for general corporate use  including acquisitions and share repurchases 
financing and investing activities in addition to our strong cash flows generated by operating activities  we use commercial paper and debt to maintain adequate operating and financial flexibility 
as of december  and  we had commercial paper and debt outstanding of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
our debt to total capital ratio was and as of december  and december   respectively

consistent with our intention of maintaining our senior debt ratings in the a range  we currently intend to maintain our debt to total capital ratio at approximately or less 
a significant downgrade in our debt or commercial paper ratings could adversely affect our borrowing capacity and costs 
under our board of directors authorization  we maintain a common stock repurchase program 
repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices  subject to certain restrictions on volume  pricing and timing 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares at an average price of approximately per share and an aggregate cost of approximately billion 
as of december   we had board of directors authorization to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 
our common stock repurchase program is discretionary as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares 
we repurchase shares because we believe it is a prudent use of capital 
a decision by the company to discontinue share repurchases would significantly increase our liquidity and financial flexibility 
we currently have a billion universal s shelf registration statement for common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and other securities which has been declared effective by the sec 
in addition  we are considered a well known seasoned issuer under the securities offering reform act that became effective in december we have not yet issued any securities under this shelf registration statement 
we may publicly offer securities from time to time at prices and terms to be determined at the time of offering 
we intend to issue debt securities during the first quarter of to refinance some or all of the commercial paper currently outstanding 
under our s acquisition shelf registration statement  we have remaining issuing capacity of million shares of our common stock in connection with acquisition activities 
we filed separate s registration statements for the million shares issued in connection with the february acquisition of mamsi  the million shares issued in connection with the july acquisition of oxford and the million shares issued in connection with the december acquisition of pacificare described previously 

table of contents contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements and commitments the following table summarizes future obligations due by period as of december   under our various contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements and commitments in millions to to thereafter total debt and commercial paper interest on debt and commercial paper operating leases purchase obligations future policy benefits other long term obligations total contractual obligations debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants 
we believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote 
calculated using stated rates from the debt agreements and related interest rate swap agreements and assuming amounts are outstanding through their contractual term 
for variable rate obligations  we used the rates in place as of december  to estimate all remaining contractual payments 
includes fixed or minimum commitments under existing purchase obligations for goods and services  including agreements which are cancelable with the payment of an early termination penalty 
excludes agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also excludes liabilities to the extent recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december  estimated payments required under life and annuity contracts 
under our reinsurance arrangement with oneamerica financial partners  inc oneamerica these amounts are payable by oneamerica but we remain primarily liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay see note of the consolidated financial statements 
includes obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs and minority interest purchase commitments 
currently  we do not have any other material contractual obligations  off balance sheet arrangements or commitments that require cash resources  however  we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations 
this includes internal development of new products  programs and technology applications  and may include acquisitions 
aarp in january  we entered into a year contract to provide health insurance products and services to members of aarp 
these products and services are provided to supplement benefits covered under traditional medicare 
under the terms of the contract  we are compensated for transaction processing and other services as well as for assuming underwriting risk 
we are also engaged in product development activities to complement the insurance offerings under this program 
premium revenues from our portion of the aarp insurance offerings were approximately billion in  billion in and billion in the underwriting gains or losses related to the aarp business are directly recorded as an increase or decrease to a rate stabilization fund rsf 
the primary components of the underwriting results are premium revenue  medical costs  investment income  administrative expenses  member services expenses  marketing expenses and premium taxes 
underwriting gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease to the rsf and accrue to the overall benefit of the aarp policyholders  unless cumulative net losses were to exceed the balance in the rsf 
to the extent underwriting losses exceed the balance in the rsf  we would have to fund the deficit 
any deficit we fund could be recovered by underwriting gains in future periods of the contract 
to date  we have not been required to fund any underwriting deficits 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the rsf balance is reported in other policy liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the rsf balance is sufficient to cover potential future underwriting or other risks associated with the contract 

table of contents medicare part d pharmacy benefits contract the company has contracted with the centers for medicare medicaid services to serve as a prescription drug plan sponsor offering medicare part d prescription drug insurance coverage to eligible medicare beneficiaries  beginning january  this product is either offered as a stand alone product or as an element of the medicare advantage products 
as a result of this contract and the december acquisition of pacificare  premium revenues from medicare related programs  which have historically been approximately of total premium revenues  are expected to increase to approximately in regulatory capital and dividend restrictions we conduct a significant portion of our operations through companies that are subject to standards established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
these standards  among other things  require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
the agencies that assess our creditworthiness also consider capital adequacy levels when establishing our debt ratings 
consistent with our intent to maintain our senior debt ratings in the a range  we maintain an aggregate statutory capital level for our regulated subsidiaries that is significantly higher than the minimum level regulators require 
as of december   our regulated subsidiaries had aggregate statutory capital of approximately billion  which is significantly more than the aggregate minimum regulatory requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
medical costs each reporting period  we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied  centrally controlled and automated 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  seasonal variances in medical care consumption  provider contract rate changes  medical care utilization and other medical cost trends  membership volume and demographics  benefit plan changes  and business mix changes related to products  customers and geography 
depending on the health care provider and type of service  the typical billing lag for services can range from two to days from the date of service 
substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to months from the date of service 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
each period  we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as more complete claim information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the 
table of contents period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate  we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate  we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development 
historically  the net impact of estimate developments has represented less than of annual medical costs  less than of annual earnings from operations and less than of medical costs payable 
in order to evaluate the impact of changes in medical cost estimates for any particular discrete period  one should consider both the amount of development recorded in the current period pertaining to prior periods and the amount of development recorded in subsequent periods pertaining to the current period 
the accompanying table provides a summary of the net impact of favorable development on medical costs and earnings from operations in millions 
favorable development net impact on medical costs a medical costs earnings from operations as reported as adjusted b as reported as adjusted b c  c  c a the amount of favorable development recorded in the current year pertaining to the prior year less the amount of favorable development recorded in the subsequent year pertaining to the current year 
b represents reported amounts adjusted to reflect the net impact of medical cost development 
c not yet determinable as the amount of prior period development recorded in will change as our december  medical costs payable estimate develops throughout our estimate of medical costs payable represents management s best estimate of the company s liability for unpaid medical costs as of december   developed using consistently applied actuarial methods 
management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover the company s liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments may differ from established estimates 
the increase in favorable medical cost development in was driven primarily by lower than anticipated medical costs as well as growth in the size of the medical cost base and related medical payables due to organic growth and businesses acquired since the beginning of assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of medical costs payable and actual costs payable  excluding the aarp business  earnings from operations would increase or decrease by million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by per share 
contingent liabilities because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely involved in various disputes  legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters 
our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverages  if any  for such matters 
we do not believe any matters currently threatened or pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets as of december   we had long lived assets  including goodwill  other intangible assets  property  equipment and capitalized software  of billion 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the 
table of contents reporting unit level  and we review our remaining long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate we might not recover their carrying value 
to determine the fair value of our long lived assets and assess their recoverability  we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors including estimated future utility and estimated future cash flows  which in turn are based on estimates of future revenues  expenses and operating margins 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
revenues revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums 
we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services  as recorded in our records 
employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears 
each billing includes an adjustment for prior month changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing 
we estimate and adjust the current period s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly 
our estimates are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information 
we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period  and record changes in the period they become known 
investments as of december   we had approximately billion of investments  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude unrealized gains and losses on investments available for sale from earnings and report them together  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in shareholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
if any of our investments experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary  based on analysis of relevant factors  we record a realized loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment s fair value is other than temporary 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
we revise impairment judgments when new information becomes known and record any resulting impairment charges at that time 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
inflation the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation 
these include setting commercial premiums based on anticipated health care costs and coordinating care with physicians and other health care providers 
through contracts with physicians and other health care providers  we emphasize preventive health care  appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards  education and closing gaps in care 
we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful 
however  other factors including competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from physicians and other health care providers and consumers  major epidemics  and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation 
because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products  changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 

table of contents legal matters because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings 
we record liabilities for our estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters 
these matters include  but are not limited to  claims relating to health care benefits coverage  medical malpractice actions  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
beginning in  a series of class action lawsuits were filed against both unitedhealthcare and pacificare  and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business 
in december  a multidistrict litigation panel consolidated several litigation cases involving unitedhealth group and our affiliates  including pacificare  in the southern district court of florida  miami division 
generally  the health care provider plaintiffs allege violations of erisa and the racketeer influenced corrupt organization act rico in connection with alleged undisclosed policies intended to maximize profits 
other allegations include breach of state prompt payment laws and breach of contract claims for failure to timely reimburse providers for medical services rendered 
the consolidated suits seek injunctive  compensatory and equitable relief as well as restitution  costs  fees and interest payments 
the trial court granted the health care providers motion for class certification and that order was reviewed by the eleventh circuit court of appeals 
the eleventh circuit affirmed the class action status of the rico claims  but reversed as to the breach of contract  unjust enrichment and prompt payment claims 
during the course of the litigation  there have been co defendant settlements 
through a series of motions and appeals  all direct claims against us have been compelled to arbitration 
a trial date has been set for september the trial court has ordered that the trial be split into separate liability and damage proceedings 
in august  the capitation related claims were dismissed from litigation 
on january   the trial court dismissed all remaining claims against pacificare 
a march  hearing date has been scheduled for our summary judgment motion 
on march   the american medical association filed a lawsuit against the company in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york 
on april   we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the suit alleges causes of action based on erisa  as well as breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  deceptive acts and practices  and trade libel in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers 
the suit seeks declaratory  injunctive and compensatory relief as well as costs  fees and interest payments 
an amended complaint was filed on august   which alleged two classes of plaintiffs  an erisa class and a non erisa class 
after the court dismissed certain erisa claims and the claims brought by the american medical association  a third amended complaint was filed 
on october   the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint 
on may   we filed a counterclaim complaint in this matter alleging antitrust violations against the american medical association and asserting claims based on improper billing practices against an individual provider plaintiff 
on may   we filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking the dismissal of certain claims and parties based  in part  due to lack of standing 
on july   plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint  seeking to assert rico violations 
although the results of pending litigation are always uncertain  we do not believe the results of any such actions currently threatened or pending  including those described above  will  individually or in aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks market risk represents the risk of changes in the fair value of a financial instrument caused by changes in interest rates or equity prices 
the company s primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates that could impact the fair value of our investments and long term debt 

table of contents approximately billion of our cash equivalents and investments at december  were debt securities 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our fixed income investment portfolio at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease or increase by approximately million 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or industry and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
to mitigate the financial impact of changes in interest rates  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to more closely match the interest rates of our long term debt with those of our cash equivalents and short term investments 
including the impact of our interest rate swap agreements  approximately billion of our commercial paper and debt had variable rates of interest and approximately billion had fixed rates as of december  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to the fair value of our commercial paper and debt 
at december   we had million of equity investments  a portion of which were held by our unitedhealth capital business in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies 
market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity portfolio 
concentrations of credit risk investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject unitedhealth group to concentrations of credit risk 
our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors 
this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base 
as discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have a billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our life and annuity business 
we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery 
as of december   there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 
cautionary statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k include forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of pslra 
when used in this annual report on form k and in future filings by us with the securities and exchange commission  in our news releases  presentations to securities analysts or investors  and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers  the words or phrases believes  anticipates  expects  plans  seeks  intends  will likely result  estimates  projects or similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the pslra 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion contains certain cautionary statements regarding our business that investors and others should consider 
except to the extent otherwise required by federal securities laws  we do not undertake to address or update forward looking statements in future filings or communications regarding our business or operating results  and do not undertake to address how any of these factors may have caused results to differ from discussions or information contained in previous filings or communications 
in addition  any of the matters discussed below may have affected past  as well as current  forward looking statements about future results 
any or all forward looking statements in this form k and in any other public filings or statements we make may 
table of contents turn out to be wrong 
they can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed below will be important in determining future results 
by their nature  forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify 
actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed in our prior communications 
we must effectively manage our health care costs 
under our risk based product arrangements  we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums 
premium revenues from risk based products excluding aarp have typically comprised approximately to of our total consolidated revenues 
we generally use approximately to of our premium revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to these customers 
the profitability of our risk based products depends in large part on our ability to predict  price for  and effectively manage health care costs 
total health care costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered and the cost of each service 
our premium revenue is typically fixed in price for a month period and is generally priced one to four months before the contract commences 
we base the premiums we charge on our estimate of future health care costs over the fixed premium period  however  inflation  regulations and other factors may cause actual costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased use of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments and technology  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  insured population characteristics and seasonal changes in the level of health care use 
as a measure of the impact of medical cost on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for unitedhealthcare s commercial insured products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
in addition  the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs that have been incurred for which claims are still outstanding 
if these estimates prove too high or too low  the effect of the change in estimate will be included in future results 
that change can be either positive or negative to our results 
we face competition in many of our markets and customers have flexibility in moving between competitors 
our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which they operate 
for our uniprise and health care services segments  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  humana inc  and wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas 
our specialized care services and ingenix segments also compete with a number of businesses 
the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily  and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
in particular markets  competitors may have capabilities or resources that give them a competitive advantage 
greater market share  established reputation  superior supplier or provider arrangements  existing business relationships  and other factors all can provide a competitive advantage to our businesses or to their competitors 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate  both as to our competitors and suppliers in these industries 
consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers  to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers  or to maintain or advance profitability 
our relationship with aarp is important 
under our year contract with aarp  which commenced in  we provide medicare supplement and hospital indemnity health insurance and other products to aarp members 
as of december   our portion of aarp s insurance program represented approximately billion in annual net premium revenue from approximately million aarp members 
the aarp contract may be terminated early by us or aarp under certain circumstances  including a material breach by either party  insolvency of either party  a material 
table of contents adverse change in the financial condition of either party  and by mutual agreement 
the success of our aarp arrangement depends  in part  on our ability to service aarp and its members  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
some of the favorable and unfavorable effects of changes in medicare remain uncertain 
the changes in medicare as a result of the medicare modernization act of mma are complex and wide ranging and continue to affect our businesses 
we have taken advantage of new opportunities to partner with the federal government created by the mma  including medicare part d prescription drug coverage  medicare advantage regional ppos  and special needs plans for chronically ill medicare beneficiaries 
we have invested considerable resources in creating new medicare product offerings for these initiatives and in analyzing how to best address uncertainties and risks associated with these new programs and other changes arising from the mma 
in particular  the part d program presents challenges because of the size and scope of the new program 
our ability to successfully participate in the part d program depends in part on coordination of information and information systems between us  cms and state governments 
we have been working with cms to correct systems issues that they have experienced with respect to certain low income people eligible to participate in part d 
the inability to receive correct information due to systems issues by the federal government  the applicable state government or us could adversely affect our business 
additionally  our participation in the part d program is based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  pharmaceutical costs and other factors 
in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect  either as a result of unforeseen changes to the part d program or otherwise  our results could be materially affected 
any positive or negative results of the part d program are likely to have a significant impact on us as a result of the size of our enrollment in our part d program 
we are subject to funding risks with respect to revenue received from participation in medicare and medicaid programs 
we participate as a payer in medicare advantage  part d  and medicaid programs and receive revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs to provide benefits under these programs 
revenues for these programs are dependent upon annual funding from the federal government or applicable state governments 
funding for these programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control including general economic conditions at the federal or applicable state level and general political issues and priorities 
an unexpected reduction in government funding for these programs may adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
our business is subject to routine government scrutiny  and we must respond quickly and appropriately to frequent changes in government regulations 
our business is regulated at the federal  state  local and international levels 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering those regulations 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  increase our health care and administrative costs and capital requirements  and increase our liability in federal and state courts for coverage determinations  contract interpretation and other actions 
we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market many of our products  to increase prices for certain regulated products and to complete certain acquisitions and dispositions 
delays in obtaining approvals or our failure to obtain or maintain these approvals could reduce our revenue or increase our costs 
we participate in federal  state and local government health care coverage programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
such changes have adversely affected our financial results and willingness to participate in such programs in the past  and may do so in the future 

table of contents state legislatures and congress continue to focus on health care issues 
legislative and regulatory proposals at state and federal levels may affect certain aspects of our business  including contracting with physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  physician reimbursement methods and payment rates  coverage determinations  claim payments and processing  drug utilization and patient safety efforts  use and maintenance of individually identifiable health information  medical malpractice litigation  and government sponsored programs 
we cannot predict if any of these initiatives will ultimately become binding law or regulation  or  if enacted  what their terms will be  but their enactment could increase our costs  expose us to expanded liability  require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business 
we typically are involved in various governmental investigations  audits and reviews 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and state attorneys general  the office of the inspector general  the office of personnel management  the office of civil rights  the department of justice and us attorneys 
such government actions can result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions  including restrictions or changes in the way we conduct business  loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government programs 
in addition  public perception or publicity surrounding routine governmental investigations may adversely affect our stock price  damage our reputation in various markets or make it more difficult for us to sell products and services 
relationships with physicians  hospitals and other health care providers are important to our business 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for competitive prices 
our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices 
a number of organizations are advocating for legislation that would exempt certain of these physicians and health care professionals from federal and state antitrust laws 
in any particular market  these physicians and health care professionals could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multispecialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 
in addition  we have capitation arrangements with some physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
under the typical arrangement  the provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all the medical costs provided to the capitated member 
under some capitated arrangements  the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the provider 
to the extent that a capitated provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement  we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that are the responsibility of the capitated provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement 
the nature of our business exposes us to litigation risks 
periodically  we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  shareholder suits  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings 
these matters include  among others  claims related to health care benefits coverage  medical malpractice actions  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
in  a number of class action lawsuits were filed against unitedhealthcare and pacificare and virtually all major entities in the health benefits business  although all claims against pacificare have been dismissed 
the suits are 
table of contents purported class actions on behalf of physicians for alleged breaches of federal statutes  including erisa and rico 
in march  the american medical association filed a lawsuit against us in connection with the calculation of reasonable and customary reimbursement rates for non network providers 
although the expenses we have incurred to date in defending the class action lawsuits and the american medical association lawsuit have not been material to our business  we will continue to incur expenses in the defense of these lawsuits and other matters  even if they are without merit 
the company is largely self insured with regard to litigation risks  however  we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize risks associated with catastrophic claims 
although we believe that we are adequately insured for claims in excess of our self insurance  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages  are not covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters 
although we believe the liabilities established for these risks are adequate  it is possible that the level of actual losses may exceed the liabilities recorded 
our businesses providing pharmacy benefit management pbm services face regulatory and other risks associated with the pharmacy benefits management industry that may differ from the risks of providing managed care and health insurance products 
in connection with the pacificare merger  we acquired a pharmacy benefits management business  prescription solutions 
we also provide pharmacy benefits management services through unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions 
prescription solutions and unitedhealth pharmaceutical solutions are subject to federal and state anti remuneration and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers  customers and consumers 
federal and state legislatures are considering new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices  including the receipt of rebates from pharmaceutical companies 
in addition  if a court were to determine that our pbm business acts as a fiduciary under the employee retirement income security act  or erisa  we could be subject to claims for alleged breaches of fiduciary obligations in implementation of formularies  preferred drug listings and therapeutic intervention programs  contracting network practices  speciality drug distribution and other transactions 
our pbm also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy  which subjects it to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  as well as risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose our pbm subsidiary to civil and criminal penalties 
we also face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order pharmacy 
our businesses depend on effective information systems and the integrity of the data in our information systems 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  provide effective and efficient service to our customers  and to accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of our acquisition activities  we have acquired additional systems 
we have been taking steps to reduce the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have disputes with customers  physicians and other health care providers have regulatory problems  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
the value of our intangible assets may become impaired 
due largely to our recent acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately billion as of december   representing approximately of our total assets 
if we make additional acquisitions it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible 
table of contents assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in shareholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
our knowledge and information related businesses depend on our ability to maintain proprietary rights to our databases and related products 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services 
we must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality 
the use of individually identifiable data by our businesses is regulated at the international  federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from the privacy and security provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of  hipaa 
hipaa also imposes guidelines on our business associates as this term is defined in the hipaa regulations 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our business associates  we still have limited control over their actions and practices 
compliance with these proposals  requirements  and new regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes  and the effects of potential noncompliance by our business associates 
they also may impose further restrictions on our use of patient identifiable data that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 
the anticipated benefits of acquiring pacificare may not be realized 
we acquired pacificare with the expectation that the merger will result in various benefits including  among others  benefits relating to a stronger and more diverse network of doctors and other health care providers  expanded and enhanced affordable health care services  enhanced revenues  a strengthened market position for unitedhealth group in the western united states  cross selling opportunities  technology  cost savings and operating efficiencies 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties  including whether unitedhealth group integrates pacificare in an efficient and effective manner and general competitive factors in the marketplace 
failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs  decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management s time and energy  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and operating results
