item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of february  we owned and operated restaurants located in california  oregon  colorado  arizona  texas and nevada 
in addition we have one licensed restaurant in lahaina  maui 
each of our restaurants is operated either as a bj s restaurant brewery  a bj s restaurant brewhouse  or a bj s pizza grill restaurant 
our menu features our award winning  signature deep dish pizza  our own handcrafted beers as well as a wide selection of appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads and desserts 
we have bj s restaurant brewery restaurants that feature in house brewing facilities where our handcrafted beers are produced 
the first bj s restaurant was opened in orange county  california in as a small full service restaurant focusing on chicago style deep dish pizza 
in our current co chairmen assumed the operations of the restaurants and in purchased the restaurants from the original founders 
in  the company opened its first large format and brewery restaurant in brea  california and we began to expand the menu to include appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads and desserts 
as of february   we operated bj s restaurant brewery restaurants that manufacture our beer for our restaurants  bj s restaurant brewhouse restaurants  which are identical to our brewery restaurants except that they do not manufacture their own beer and seven bj s pizza grill restaurants  which are primarily our original legacy restaurants 
our growth will focus on our bj s restaurant brewhouse  however we may continue to build additional bj s restaurant brewery locations in certain areas where we believe it may be more appropriate to brew our own beer 
we also have contract brewing arrangements in which we utilize the excess capacity of other highly qualified craft brewers to produce our hand crafted beers under our proprietary recipes in we purchased additional restaurants in oregon and washington from pietro s corp pietro s to expand our presence in the northwest 
the pietro s restaurants primarily served thin crust pizza in a very casual counter service environment 
over the next eight years we closed of the pietro s restaurants and converted three restaurants to bj s locations 
on march   we sold the remaining three pietro s restaurants to employees of those restaurants 

table of contents we intend to continue developing bj s restaurants in high profile locations within densely populated areas in both existing and new markets 
since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  and given our relatively high average sales per productive square foot  we generally do not expect to achieve increases in comparable sales other than our effective menu price increases for our mature restaurants 
therefore  we expect that the majority of our year over year revenue growth will come from new restaurant openings 
newly opened restaurants experience higher cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for approximately their first to days of operations in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our mature restaurants 
accordingly  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on pre opening expenses  cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs 
our revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales at our restaurant 
revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenues from our gift cards are recognized upon redemption in our restaurants 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  all outstanding balances on such cards are included as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
cost of sales is comprised of food and beverage supplies 
the components of cost of sales are variable and typically fluctuate with sales volumes 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses and payroll taxes and fringe benefits for restaurant employees 
direct operating and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  credit card fees  marketing costs  fixed rent  percentage rent  common area maintenance charges  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs 
direct operating and occupancy costs generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant sales 
general and administrative costs include all corporate  field supervision and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and related employee benefits  travel and relocation costs  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial work force for each new restaurant  travel  the cost of food used in training  marketing costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant 
in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of total revenues 
fiscal year consolidated statements of income data revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor and benefits occupancy operating expenses general and administrative depreciation and amortization restaurant opening expense gain on sale of pietro s restaurants recovery of restaurant closing expense total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net total other income expense income before taxes income tax expense net income 
table of contents fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of the million increase in revenues consisted of an approximate million increase in restaurant sales from the opening of new restaurants  and an approximate million or increase from comparable restaurant sales 
the comparable restaurant sales benefited from a menu price increase of approximately with the majority of the increase due to increased customer counts 
these revenue increases were partially offset by approximate million of restaurant sales related to our three pietro s restaurants and our seal beach bj s pizza grill restaurant  which were closed on march  and january   respectively 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this increase is primarily a result of increased costs for meat  produce  seafood  general grocery items and fuel surcharges from our distributors partially offset by a reduction in poultry and cheese costs and the impact of menu price increases 
additionally  in our new restaurants  our cost of sales will typically be higher during the first days of operations versus our mature restaurants  as management teams become accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing sales volumes we expect at our restaurants 
we provide our customers a large variety of menu items and therefore we are not overly dependent on a single group of commodities 
we continue to work with our suppliers to control food costs  however  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our restaurants will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
labor and benefits 
labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of this increase was primarily due to the opening of nine new restaurants  partially offset by the closing of our pietro s and seal beach restaurants 
as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs increased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this percentage increase is primarily due to higher management labor as a result of our decision to improve our management staffing levels and inefficiencies experienced with the nine new restaurants we opened in compared to the seven new restaurants we opened in the in for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes expected at our restaurants 
occupancy operating expenses 
occupancy operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of the increase reflects additional operating occupancy expenses related to the nine new restaurants we opened in  partially offset by the decrease in costs associated with our three pietro s restaurants that were sold on march  and the closure of our seal beach bj s pizza grill restaurant on january  as a percentage of revenues  occupancy operating expenses decreased to for the week period from for the prior year week period 
this decrease is primarily due to lower rent payments as a result of two land purchases in which we therefore pay no rent and a higher mix of ground leased locations versus both ground and building leased locations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of this increase was the result of planned investments in our field supervision and corporate support infrastructure to support our growth 
during  we expect to continue to add resources to the corporate support and field supervision activities in preparation for the planned openings of as many as new restaurants 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the week period from for the prior year week period 
this percentage decrease is primarily the result of our continued ability to leverage the fixed nature of many of these costs over our increased revenues and the absence of severance payments to three corporate employees which were expensed during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of restaurant equipment  furniture  leasehold improvements and brewery equipment related to new restaurant development 
restaurant opening expense 
restaurant opening expense increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of this increase is primarily due to opening costs related to nine restaurant openings and four restaurants in progress during the weeks ended january   as compared to seven restaurant openings 
table of contents and two restaurants in progress during the week period of our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period  depending upon  but not limited to  the number of restaurant openings  the size and concept of the restaurants being opened  the location of the restaurants and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
gain on sale of pietro s restaurants 
in fiscal  we sold our three pietro s restaurants resulting in a million pre tax gain 
interest income  net 
net interest income increased by  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from  during the week period of this increase is primarily due to increased investments after the completion of our private placement on march  coupled with higher interest rates 
other income  net 
net other income decreased to  during weeks ended january  from  during the week period of  a decrease of  this decrease is primarily due to the loss of gaming income from our pietro s restaurants  which we sold on march  income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  was compared to for the week period of the effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to fica tip credits 
we currently estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately at for fiscal however  the actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  pretax income and tax credits achieved during the year 
fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of the million increase in revenues consisted of an approximate million increase in restaurant sales from the opening of new restaurants  and an approximate million or from comparable restaurant sales 
the comparable restaurant sales increase is primarily due to an increase in customer counts  a menu price increase of approximately effective during may  and an additional increase of approximately effective during november and a soda and beer price increase of effective during may and october  respectively 
these revenue increases were partially offset by the loss of approximately million of restaurant sales in related to our three pietro s restaurants which we sold on march  additionally  fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks for fiscal after adjusting for million of restaurant revenues contributed by the additional operating week  restaurant revenues would have increased by or million for fiscal on a week basis cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this decrease is a result of increased menu prices and our continuing efforts to monitor costs 
during  commodity prices for meat increased while dairy products decreased in comparison to labor and benefits 
labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by million  or to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of this increase was substantially due to the opening of seven new restaurants in as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs increased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this slight increase is primarily due to inefficiencies related to new restaurants 
occupancy operating expenses 
occupancy and operating expenses increased by million  or to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of the increase reflects the seven additional restaurants we opened during  partially offset by the sale of our three pietro s restaurants on march  as a percentage of revenues  occupancy costs decreased to in from in this decrease is primarily due to the fact that five out of the restaurants opened during and were ground leases with monthly lease payments below our historical rent levels  and our ability to leverage the fixed nature of many of these costs as a result of our comparable sales increases 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this increase is primarily the result of increased compensation  severance payments of  to three corporate employees and  related to sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of restaurant equipment  furniture  leasehold improvements and brewery equipment totaling million for the seven restaurants opened in and million for the four restaurants opened in  coupled with three restaurants opened over the last year that had ground leases resulting in higher leasehold improvement costs 

table of contents restaurant opening expense 
restaurant opening expense increased by million  or to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of this increase is primarily due to opening costs related to seven restaurant openings in when compared to four restaurant openings in in addition  we incurred restaurant opening expense in both years for restaurants which were in progress of opening 
our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period  depending upon  but not limited to  the number of restaurant openings  the size and concept of the restaurants being opened and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
furthermore  approximately  of the increase is related to the correction of our holiday rent accounting 
gain on sale of pietro s restaurants 
on march   we sold our three pietro s restaurants resulting in a million pre tax gain 
interest income  net 
net interest income  increased by  or to  during the weeks ended january  from  during the week period of this increase is primarily due to the repayment of our related party debt and other long term debt at the beginning of other income  net 
net other income increased to by  or to  during the weeks ended january  from a net expense of  in the week period of the increase was primarily due to the  charge related to our meal rest periods settlement in offset by the  received in connection with another settlement  decreased license fee income from our interest in the bj s lahaina  maui  hawaii restaurant and the sale of our pietro s restaurants in which generated gaming income 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of  an increase of  the increase was primarily due to increased income before taxes of million offset by the reduction of our tax reserve and valuation allowance of  our effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  was compared to for the comparable week period of our effective rate decreased due to additional utilization of fica tip credits  and the reduction of our tax reserve and valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements are principally related to restaurant growth plans 
similar to many restaurant chains  we utilize operating lease arrangements for substantially all of our restaurant locations 
during fiscal  we opened nine new restaurants 
we currently expect to open as many as new restaurants during fiscal we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while our operating lease obligations are not required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheets  the minimum rents and related fixed asset obligations under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
our requirement for working capital is not significant  since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale 
thus  we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items 
our cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  provided million of net cash during the weeks ended january   a million increase from the million generated during the week period of the increase in cash from operating activities for the weeks ended january   in comparison to weeks ended january   is primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors included in accrued expenses  increased prepaids and other assets due to the timing of rent payments  landlord tenant improvement contributions and increased net income  partially offset by the gain on sale of pietro s restaurants 
total capital expenditures for the acquisition of our restaurant and brewery equipment and leasehold improvements to construct new restaurants were million for the weeks ended january  these expenditures were primarily related to the development of our new restaurants in moreno valley  corona  roseville  rancho cucamonga  san bruno and san mateo  california  tucson and mesa  arizona  and sugarland  texas locations all of which opened prior to january  and construction of our vacaville  california  desert ridge  arizona and westminster  colorado locations which we anticipate to open in fiscal the vacaville  california location opened subsequent to year end on february  in addition  for the weeks ended january   total capital expenditures related to the maintenance of existing restaurants were million 
on march   we completed sold million shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share for million net of approximately million in related fees and expenses 
on december   we established a million unsecured revolving line of credit the line of credit which expires on december  availability under the line of credit is reduced by outstanding letters of credit primarily for our self insurance programs 
as of january   there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit and million in letters of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit will bear interest at per annum in excess of the applicable libor rate 

table of contents prior to the march equity offering  we funded our capital requirements primarily through cash flows from operations and proceeds received from the exercise of redeemable warrants during as of february   we have entered into signed leases  of which the restaurants have not yet began operations  and we expect to enter into additional leases for new restaurant locations 
our capital requirements related to opening additional restaurants will continue to be significant 
we currently anticipate our capital expenditures for to be approximately million related to the construction of our new restaurants and a  barrel brewery in reno nevada  two land purchases  the reinvestment in some of our older restaurants as well as normal maintenance capital expenditures and the investment in our restaurant toolsets 
we expect to fund these expenditures with our current cash and investment balances and our cash flow from operations 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our current cash flow and our cash and investments balances together with anticipated cash flows from operations should be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through fiscal we may seek additional funds to finance our future growth and operations 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when required or available on terms acceptable to us 
sale of pietro s restaurants in february  we executed an agreement to sell our three pietro s restaurants effective on march   resulting in a million pre tax gain 
the buyers  formerly employees  purchased the restaurant assets and related trademarks for the pietro s brand 
the million sales price includes cash proceeds of million and two notes receivable from the buyers totaling  with terms of five and ten years 
the ten year note is in the amount of  bears interest at prime plus one percent with a minimum interest rate of and a maximum interest rate of and requires fixed monthly payments of principal and interest over the ten year term 
the five year note is in the amount of  bears interest at prime plus one percent and requires fixed monthly payments of principal and interest over the five year term 
our notes are subordinated to the buyer s sba loan 
principal payments to the company on both notes were prohibited for the first six months by the buyer s sba loan 
for these three pietro s restaurants sold  sales were  and  and pre tax income was  and  for the thirteen weeks ended march  and march   respectively 
the net book value of the assets sold as of march  was  off balance sheet arrangements as part of our on going business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated vie transactions 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect our operations 
many of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
minimum wages have been increased numerous times and remain subject to future increases 
while we have been able to react to inflation and other changes in our costs of key operating expenses by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  combined with reduced purchasing costs  and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
we cannot guarantee that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
many of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and adverse weather our results of operations have historically been impacted by seasonality  which directly impacts tourism at our coastal california locations 
the summer months june through august have traditionally been higher volume periods than other periods of the year 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated restaurant opening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management and are important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost 
property and equipment accounting requires estimates of the useful lives for the assets for depreciation purposes and selection of depreciation methods 
we believe the useful lives reflect the actual economic life of the underlying assets 
we have elected to use the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful life of an asset or the primary lease term of the respective lease  whichever is shorter 
renewals and betterments that materially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
judgment is often required in the decision to distinguish between an asset which qualifies for capitalization versus an expenditure which is for maintenance and repairs 
we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant level for indicators of impairment 
if impairment indicators were identified  then assets would be recorded at fair value 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of january   no impairment indicators have been identified 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a portion of our employee workers compensation program 
we maintain coverage with a third party insurer to limit our total exposure for this program 
the accrued liability associated with this program is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on information provided by our insurance broker and insurer  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history  case jurisdiction  related legislation  and our claims settlement practice 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be significantly impacted 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
we file our tax returns with the advice and compilation of tax consultants 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets future tax deductions and fica tax credit carryforwards 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
leases we lease the majority of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases sfas and subsequent amendments  which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases pursuant to the requirements of sfas we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and furniture fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for permanent improvements that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions also known as tenant improvement allowances pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions can take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 

table of contents impact of recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values determined at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
on april   the securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule that amends the compliance dates for statement r 
under the new rule  we adopted statement r on january  as permitted by statement  prior to january   we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the estimated impact of adopting statement r for  excluding any prospective equity award grants  is currently expected to be approximately million  net of taxes 
this estimate includes costs related to unvested stock options and our current stock compensation programs 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share above 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
on october   the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
generally  the staff position requires companies to expense rental costs incurred during a construction period 
as permitted prior to the adoption of fsp  we capitalized rental costs during construction 
we adopted fsp on january  the financial statement impact of the adoption of the staff s position is expected to range from approximately  to  in additional preopening rent expense per restaurant during which may vary based on lease terms  restaurant openings and length of construction period 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  as amendment of apb opinion no 
accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
this statement amends the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged and more broadly provides for exceptions regarding exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring during our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which changes the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the usual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractical to determine either the period specific or cumulative effects of the change 
statement no 
is effective for accounting changes made in our fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations as of january   including estimated cash payments due by period in thousands 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit for more detailed description of our operating leases  refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent non cancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and other services 

table of contents additionally  we have entered into lease agreements related to future restaurants with commencement dates subsequent to january  our aggregate future commitment relating to these leases is million and is not included in operating leases above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than twelve months as of the date of purchase 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
for the weeks ended january   the average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments was approximately we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
