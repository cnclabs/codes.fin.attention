table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the consolidated financial statements and other portions of this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   including item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  reflect the effects of presenting sequoia insurance company and two businesses sold by hyperfeed technologies  inc as discontinued operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations  and presenting hyperfeed technologies  inc as a separate segment beginning may  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  consolidation of hyperfeed technologies  inc company summary  recent developments  and future outlook water resources and water storage operations vidler water company  inc 
background we believe that continuing trends in nevada and arizona indicate strong future demand for vidler s water rights and water storage assets 
based on figures published by the nevada state demographer  in the five years from to  the population of clark county  nevada  which includes metropolitan las vegas  increased to almost million residents 
around  people are moving to the area annually 
currently las vegas takes most of its water supply from lake mead  which is primarily fed by water flows from the colorado river 
due to the continued growth in demand for water and a prolonged drought  the level of lake mead is close to year lows 
accordingly  las vegas is aggressively seeking to conserve water eg  rules have been introduced restricting water use in new homes and to diversify its sources of water supply 
at the same time  the increasing cost of housing in las vegas is leading to more rapid growth in outlying areas within commuting distance 
over time  we believe that these factors will lead to demand for water in parts of southern nevada where vidler owns or has an interest in water rights  including southern lincoln county  sandy valley  and moapa valley muddy river in clark county 
if growth management initiatives are introduced in las vegas  this will lead to even more rapid growth in the areas surrounding metropolitan las vegas 
due to the low level of lake mead  the states of arizona  california  and nevada may be required to take no more than their current allotments of water from the colorado river 
this is likely to increase demand for the net recharge credits owned by vidler  representing water which vidler has in storage in its arizona recharge facility 
we also anticipate demand from developers and other entities to store water for various purposes  including back up water supply for dry years by developers  and assured water supply for new development projects 
the central arizona water conservation district cawcd is a three county water district servicing the most populous parts of the state  including maricopa county 
a cawcd study predicted that cawcd will be able to use million acre feet of water from arizona s colorado river supplies in the years from through  assuming average annual precipitation 
the cawcd also estimated that million acre feet will be required over the same period by the central arizona groundwater replenishment district  the authority responsible for protecting groundwater supplies in the cawcd three county service area 
the cawcd also estimated demand of million acre feet from the arizona water bank for various purposes eg  use in nevada  and a further million acre feet to replenish groundwater reserves 
based on these forecasts  arizona appears to be faced with a shortfall of million acre feet of water in the period through  which will require cawcd to purchase additional supplies 
the southern nevada water authority has released an updated water resource plan which can be viewed at www 
snwa 
com to develop and deliver water supplies to meet regional growth demands 
this plan consists of the storage of water  including up to million acre feet in arizona  combined with the development of further water resources in nevada 
we believe that vidler s assets are favorably positioned to contribute to the water resource solutions required in nevada 
water resources arizona during  vidler closed on the sale of its holdings of approximately  acre feet of groundwater rights and the related land in the harquahala valley irrigation district to a real estate developer 
the sales price of million represented approximately  per acre foot of transferable harquahala valley irrigation district groundwater 
this transaction added approximately million to pre tax income in any new residential development in arizona must obtain a permit from the arizona department of water resources certifying a designated assured water supply sufficient to sustain the development for at least years 
harquahala valley ground water meets the designation of assured water supply  but in order to be used by municipalities in the heavily populated parts of arizona  the water must be transported from the harquahala valley to the end users 
arizona state legislation allows harquahala valley ground water to be made available as assured water supply to cities and communities in arizona through agreements with the central arizona groundwater replenishment district 
at december   vidler owned approximately  acre feet of ground water and the related land in the harquahala valley 
the harquahala valley is located in la paz county and maricopa county  approximately miles northwest of metropolitan phoenix  arizona 
according to census data  the population of maricopa county increased from to  with the addition of more than  people per year 
vidler anticipates that as the boundaries of the greater phoenix metropolitan area push out  this is likely to lead to demand for water to support growth within the harquahala valley itself 
the remaining water can also be transferred for municipal use outside of the harquahala valley 
nevada vidler has acquired water rights in northern nevada through the purchase of ranch properties  filing applications for new water rights  and entering into partnering arrangements with parties owning water rights  which they wish to maximize the value of 
nevada is the state experiencing the most rapid population growth and new home construction in the united states 
the population is concentrated in southern nevada  which includes the las vegas metropolitan area 
lincoln county vidler is working jointly with the lincoln county water district to locate and develop water resources in lincoln county  nevada 
lincoln county water district and vidler lincoln vidler have filed applications for more than  acre feet of water rights with the intention of supplying water for residential  commercial  and industrial use  as contemplated by the county s approved master plan 
we believe that this is the only known new source of water for lincoln county 
vidler anticipates that up to  acre feet of water rights will ultimately be permitted from these applications  and put to use in lincoln county and northern clark county 
under the lincoln county land act  more than  acres of federal land in southern lincoln county near the fast growing city of mesquite was offered for sale in february according to press reports  the eight parcels offered sold to various developers for approximately million 
the land was sold without environmental approvals  water  and city services  which will be required before development can proceed 
additional water supply will be required in lincoln county if this land is to be developed 
tule desert groundwater basin in  lincoln vidler filed for  acre feet of water rights for industrial use from the tule desert groundwater basin 
in november  the nevada state engineer granted an application for  acre feet of water rights  and ruled that another  acre feet could be granted  but would be held in abeyance while lincoln vidler pursues additional studies in october  lincoln vidler closed on the sale of  acre feet of water to a developer in lincoln county for approximately million  which represents a price of  per acre foot 
under the agreement between the lincoln county water district and vidler  the proceeds from the sale of water will be shared equally after vidler is reimbursed for the expenses incurred in developing water resources in lincoln county 
consequently  the net cash proceeds to vidler were approximately million  and the transaction added million to revenues and million to pre tax income in  and the developer has up to years to purchase an additional  acre feet of water  as and when supplies are permitted from the applications 
we anticipate that the hearings to permit these applications will commence in during  vidler successfully drilled a series of production and monitoring wells to provide evidence to support the applications 
the initial price of  per acre foot will increase at each year 
in addition  the developer will pay a commitment fee equal to of the outstanding balance of unpurchased water each year  beginning august   which will be applied to the purchase of water 
the lincoln county undertaking is an example of a transaction where vidler can partner with an entity  in this case a government entity  to provide the necessary capital and skills to commercially develop water assets  thereby providing a significant economic benefit to the partner 

table of contents coyote springs coyote springs is a planned mixed use development to be located approximately miles north of las vegas  at the junction of us highway and state highway  partially within lincoln county  nevada  and partially within clark county  nevada 
coyote springs is the largest privately held property for development in southern nevada 
the developer  coyote springs investment  llc csil  has received entitlements for approximately  residential units  golf courses  and  acres of retail and commercial development on  acres in clark county 
csil expects to receive additional entitlements for its  acres in lincoln county 
based on the entitlements obtained so far  it is estimated that the community will require approximately  acre feet of permanent water 
additional water will be required as further entitlements are obtained 
it is expected that full absorption of the residential units will take years or more 
pardee homes has agreed to be the master residential developer on the first phase of the development 
construction of a golf course has begun  and csil has stated that the first houses should start going up in lincoln vidler have agreed to sell approximately acre feet of water rights at meadow valley  located in lincoln and clark counties  to csil for approximately million  or  per acre foot 
the water rights are the subject of an existing protest  and escrow will close within days of the protest being successfully resolved 
we anticipate that lincoln county vidler could provide the majority of the water required for the coyote springs project from the jointly filed applications for water rights in various basins in lincoln county 
lincoln vidler have agreed to sell additional water to csil  as and when supplies are permitted from existing applications in kane springs  nevada 
the applications are for up to  acre feet of water  although the actual permits received may be for a lesser quantity  which cannot be accurately predicted 
it is anticipated that the applications will be heard in  and that it could take up to months after the hearing for the application to be permitted and the sale closed 
the initial purchase price for the water will be  per acre foot for the first year of the agreement 
the price of unpurchased water will increase each year on the anniversary of the agreement 
lincoln county power plant project vidler has entered into an option agreement to sell its interest in a project to construct a new electricity generating plant in southern lincoln county  for million 
it is anticipated that the new plant will supply electricity to the new communities to be developed near mesquite  and surrounding areas  which are expected to be fast growing 
if the purchaser exercises the option to purchase the interest in the power project  the agreement is scheduled to close in the purchaser has made all of the scheduled option exercise payments to date 
this project is owned by vidler  and does not form part of the lincoln vidler undertaking 
sandy valley  nevada in june  the nevada state engineer awarded vidler acre feet of water rights near sandy valley  nevada 
vidler has filed another application for  acre feet 
the award of the permit for the acre feet of water rights has been appealed  and is currently in the nevada supreme court  which we believe is the final court of appeal for the matter 
once the appeal has been concluded  we anticipate utilizing the water rights to support future growth in sandy valley or surrounding areas in southwestern nevada 
muddy river water rights the muddy river is a perennial river fed by the muddy springs in southern nevada  originating in nevada and flowing into lake mead 
currently  muddy river water rights are utilized for agriculture and electricity generation  however  in the future  we anticipate that muddy river water rights may be utilized to support development in southern nevada 
the southern nevada water authority water resource plan identifies muddy river water rights as a water resource to support future growth in clark county  nevada 
at december   vidler owned approximately acre feet of muddy river water rights  and had the right to acquire an additional acre feet 
fish springs ranch in  vidler purchased a interest in fish springs ranch  llc fish springs and a interest in v b  llc 
these companies own the fish springs ranch and other properties totaling approximately  acres in honey lake valley in washoe county  miles north of reno  nevada  and permitted water rights related to the properties  which are transferable to the reno sparks area 
the fish springs ranch water rights have been identified as the most economical and proven new source of supply to support new growth in the north valley communities of washoe county 
according to census data  from to  the population of washoe county including reno sparks increased by to approximately  people 
residential property developers have publicly stated that reno is constrained for land 
if additional water can be supplied to reno and the surrounding areas  this will allow the development of additional land 
indicative market prices for new water delivered to reno have appreciated strongly  commensurate with increases in the value of raw land and finished homes 
given these market conditions  fish springs has determined that it would be advantageous to construct  at its own expense  a pipeline approximately miles long  to convey  acre feet of water annually from fish springs ranch to a central storage tank in northern reno to supply the northern valleys 
a final environmental impact statement for the pipeline has been completed  and the comment period has ended 
fish springs is awaiting the record of decision and the granting of rights of way by the department of the interior 
the total cost of the pipeline is estimated to be in the million to million range 
we are exploring various forms of project financing 
as of march  vidler has commitments for future capital expenditures amounting to approximately million  relating to the construction of a pipeline to convey water from the fish springs ranch to reno  nevada 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies 
big springs ranch and west wendover  nevada in december  vidler closed on the sale of approximately  acres of deeded ranch land and the related water rights at big springs ranch for million 
the ranch land was located approximately miles east of elko  in northeastern nevada 
in december  vidler closed on the sale of approximately  acres of developable land near west wendover  nevada for million 
west wendover is adjacent to the nevada utah border in the interstate corridor 
the land at west wendover was acquired in through a land exchange with the bureau of land management  under which vidler gave up approximately  acres of ranch land at big springs ranch in return for the parcels of developable land 
the assets at big springs ranch and west wendover were different in nature from vidler s remaining assets in arizona and nevada  in that the land comprised the bulk of the value of big springs ranch and west wendover  with the water rights being a lesser component 

table of contents colorado vidler is completing the process of monetizing its water rights in colorado  through sale or lease in  vidler closed on the sale of various water rights and related assets to the city of golden  colorado for million  and granted the city options to acquire other water rights over the following years 
the city exercised options to acquire water assets for  in   in  and  in if the remaining options are exercised  the present value of the aggregate purchase price is approximately million  in  vidler closed on the sale of the wet mountain water rights for in  vidler closed on the sale of approximately acre feet of water rights for  and in  vidler closed on the sale of approximately acre feet of water rights for  discussions are continuing to either lease or sell the remaining water rights in colorado  which are listed in the table in the vidler section of item  business 
water storage vidler arizona recharge facility during  vidler completed the second stage of construction at its facility to bank  or store  water underground in the harquahala valley  and received the necessary permits to operate a full scale water recharge facility 
recharge is the process of placing water into storage underground 
vidler has the permitted right to recharge  acre feet of water per year at the vidler arizona recharge facility  and anticipates being able to store in excess of million acre feet of water in the aquifer underlying much of the valley 
when needed  the water will be recovered  or removed from storage  by ground water wells 
vidler has the only permitted  complete private water storage facility in arizona 
given that arizona is the only southwestern state with surplus flows of colorado river water available for storage  we believe that vidler s is the only private water storage facility where it is practical to bank  or store  water for users in other states  which is known as interstate banking 
having a permitted water storage facility also allows vidler to acquire  and store  surplus water for re sale in future years 
the vidler arizona recharge facility is the first privately owned water storage facility for the colorado river system  which is a primary source of water for the lower division states of arizona  california  and nevada 
the water storage facility is strategically located adjacent to the central arizona project cap aqueduct  a conveyance canal running from lake havasu to phoenix and tucson 
the water to be recharged will come from surplus flows of cap water 
we believe that proximity to the cap is a competitive advantage  because it minimizes the cost of water conveyance 
vidler is able to provide storage for users located both within arizona and out of state 
potential users include industrial companies  developers  and local governmental political subdivisions in arizona  and out of state users such as municipalities and water agencies in nevada and california 
the arizona water banking authority awba has the responsibility for intrastate and interstate storage of water for governmental entities 
vidler has not yet stored water for customers at the facility  but the company has been recharging water for its own account since  when the pilot plant was constructed 
at the end of  vidler had net recharge credits representing approximately  acre feet of water in storage at the facility  and had purchased or ordered a further  acre feet for recharge in vidler purchased the water from the cap  and intends to resell this water at an appropriate time 
vidler is in discussions with a number of developers and other entities which could lead to the sale of net recharge credits 
we believe that the storage site  the net recharge credits  and vidler s remaining water rights and land in the harquahala valley could be an attractive combination to developers looking to secure water supply to support new development in the harquahala valley  which is approximately miles northwest of metropolitan phoenix  arizona 
the vidler arizona recharge facility is located in la paz county  close to the county line with fast growing maricopa county 
according to census data  the population of maricopa county increased from to  with the addition of more than  people per year 
vidler anticipates that as the boundaries of the greater phoenix metropolitan area push out  this is likely to lead to demand for water to support growth within the harquahala valley itself 
vidler anticipates being able to recharge  acre feet of water per year at the facility  and to store in excess of million acre feet of water in the aquifer 
vidler s estimate of the aquifer s storage volume is primarily based on a hydrological report prepared by an independent engineering firm for the central arizona water conservation district in  which concluded that there is storage capacity of million acre feet 
recharge and recovery capacity is critical  because it indicates how quickly water can be put into storage or recovered from storage 
in wet years  it is important to have a high recharge capacity  so that as much available water as possible may be stored 
in dry years  the crucial factor is the ability to recover water as quickly as possible 
there is a long history of farmers recovering significant quantities of water from the harquahala valley ground water aquifer for irrigation purposes 
semitropic vidler originally had an right to participate in the semitropic water banking and exchange program  which operates a  acre foot water storage facility at semitropic  near the california aqueduct  northwest of bakersfield  california 
the strategic value of the guaranteed right to recover an amount of water from semitropic every year even in drought years became clear to water agencies  developers  and other parties seeking a reliable water supply 
for example  developers of large residential projects in kern county and los angeles county must be able to demonstrate that they have sufficient back up supplies of water in the case of a drought year before they are permitted to begin development 
accordingly  during  vidler took advantage of current demand for water storage capacity with guaranteed recovery  and began to sell its interest in semitropic 
the strategic value of the guaranteed right to recover water was again highlighted by two court decisions in february which held that developers could not rely on water from state water projects 
in may  vidler closed the sale of of its original interest ie  approximately  acre feet of water storage capacity to the newhall land and farming company for million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in september  vidler closed the sale of another of its original interest ie  approximately  acre feet of water storage capacity to the alameda county water district for million  resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
vidler s remaining interest includes approximately  acre feet of storage capacity 
we have the guaranteed right to recover a minimum of approximately  acre feet every year 
in some circumstances  we have the right to recover up to approximately  acre feet in any one year 
we are considering various alternatives for the remaining interest  including sale to developers or industrial users 
currently vidler is not storing any water at semitropic for third parties 
vidler is required to make annual payments of approximately  under its agreement with semitropic water storage district 
other projects during  vidler received net cash proceeds of approximately million from the sales in the harquahala valley irrigation district and lincoln county described above 
after the payment of federal and state tax liabilities arising from these sales  which are estimated at million million of which was paid in  likely uses of vidler s available cash include continuing to develop new supplies of water in lincoln county  nevada eg  drilling costs and legal professional fees  and to investigate and evaluate water and land opportunities in the southwestern united states  which meet our risk reward and value criteria  in particular assets which have the potential to add value to our existing assets 
vidler routinely evaluates the purchase of further water righted properties in arizona and nevada 
vidler also continues to be approached by parties who are interested in obtaining a water supply  or discussing joint ventures to commercially develop water assets and or develop water storage facilities in arizona  nevada  and other southwestern states 

table of contents nevada real estate operations nevada land and resource company  llc the majority of nevada land s revenues come from the sale of land 
in addition  various types of recurring revenue are generated from use of the nevada land s properties  including leasing  easements  and mineral royalties 
nevada land also generates interest revenue from land sales contracts where nevada land has provided partial financing  and from temporary investment of the proceeds of land sales 
nevada land recognizes revenue from land sales  and the resulting gross margin  when the sales transactions close 
on closing  the entire sales price is recorded as revenue  and a gross margin is recognized depending on the cost basis attributed to the land which was sold 
since the date of closing determines the accounting period in which the sales revenue and margin are recorded  nevada land s reported revenues and income fluctuate from period to period  depending on the dates when specific transactions close  and land sales for any one year are not necessarily indicative of land sales in future years 
in  nevada land generated million in revenues from the sale of approximately  acres of former railroad land 
the average sales price of per acre compares to our average basis of per acre in the parcels which were sold 
in  of land sales were settled for cash  and nevada land provided partial financing for the remainder 
vendor financing is collateralized by the land conveyed  and typically is subject to a minimum down payment and carries a interest rate 
in and  land sales were significantly higher than in preceding years 
the million in total sales in consisted of individual sales transactions  reflecting demand for various types of land with various uses  including rural suburban urban living  desert lands  and ranching 
during and  the market for many types of real estate in nevada was buoyant 
we believe that higher prices for land in and around municipalities has increased the demand for  and in some locations the price of  property miles or more from municipalities  which our lands typically are 
it can take a year or more to complete a land sale transaction  the timing of land sales is unpredictable  and historically the level of land sales has fluctuated from year to year 
accordingly  it should not be assumed that the higher level of sales in and can be maintained

accu holding ag pico has acquired  shares in accu holding  which represents a voting ownership interest of approximately 
we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over accu holding s activities  so the investment is carried at market value under sfas no 
accu holding manufactures batteries at two plants in switzerland 
following a decline in demand for batteries during the economic slowdown  accu adjusted its production and cost structure 
accu is also preparing to redevelop the site of a former factory near zurich  which could have significant value 
our initial holding  shares in accu had a cash cost of approximately million 
during  we subscribed for our full entitlement in  and partly underwrote  a rights offering at chf per share  acquiring an additional  shares for approximately million 
the accu stock price declined significantly during   and as explained in the business financing and acquisitions portion of results of operations years ended december    and  we regularly review stocks which have declined in price from our cost 
if we determine that the decline in market value is other than temporary  we record a charge which writes our basis in the investment down from its original cost to current carrying value  which typically is the market price at the balance sheet date when the provision is recorded 
it should be noted that charges for other than temporary impairments do not affect shareholders equity or book value per share  since the after tax decline in the market value of investments carried under sfas no 
is already reflected in shareholders equity in our balance sheet 
also  the carrying book value of the holding does not change 
if the stock price subsequently recovers  the basis does not change 
given the extent and duration of the decline in the market price of accu stock  we determined that the decline in accu s market value is also other than temporary 
accordingly  we recorded pre tax charges for other than temporary impairment of our holding in accu of million in   in  and million in these charges were recorded as realized losses and reduced the basis of the investment 
at december   the holding had a basis of million  and a market carrying value of million chf million

in  sihl sold its core business  and announced a debt restructuring with its banks 
although there is no longer a public trading market for sihl  the agreement with the banks provides the shareholders with a partial return in certain circumstances 
due to the extent and duration of the decline in the market value of sihl stock  we recorded pre tax charges for other than temporary impairment of our holding in sihl of million in  and  in a  charge for permanent impairment in reduced our basis in sihl to zero at december  
table of contents insurance operations in run off typically  most of the revenues of an insurance company in run off come from investment income ie  interest from fixed income securities and dividends from stocks earned on funds held as part of their insurance business 
in addition  from time to time  gains or losses are realized from the sale of investments 
in broad terms  physicians and citation hold cash and fixed income securities corresponding to their loss reserves and state capital deposit requirements  and the excess is invested in small capitalization value stocks in the us and selected foreign markets 
given the relatively low level of interest rates  we expect to generate limited income from our bond holdings 
to maintain liquidity and to guard against capital losses which would be brought on by higher interest rates  our bond holdings are concentrated in issues maturing in years or less 
at december   the duration of citation s bond portfolio was years  and the duration of the physicians bond portfolio was years 
the duration of a bond portfolio measures the amount of time it will take for the cash flows from scheduled interest payments and the maturity of bonds to equal the current value of the portfolio 
duration indicates the sensitivity of the market value of a bond portfolio to changes in interest rates 
if interest rates increase  the market value of existing bonds will decline 
during periods when market interest rates decline  such as and  the market value of existing bonds increases 
typically  the longer the duration  the greater the sensitivity of the value of the bond portfolio to changes in interest rates 
duration of less than years is generally regarded as medium term  and less than years is generally regarded as short term 
typically  we hold bonds issued by the us treasury and government sponsored enterprises eg  freddie mac and fnma only to the extent required for capital under state insurance codes  or as required for deposits or collateral with state regulators 
otherwise  the bond portfolios consist almost entirely of investment grade corporate issues with or less years to maturity 
at december   the aggregate market value of physicians and citation s bond portfolio was within of amortized cost 
we do not own any municipal bonds  and did not own any corporate bonds in the telecommunications  utilities  energy trading  automotive  and auto finance sectors  which experienced difficulties in recent years 
the equities component of the insurance company portfolios is concentrated on a limited number of asset rich small capitalization value stocks in the us these positions have been accumulated at a significant discount to our estimate of the private market value of each company s underlying hard assets ie  land and other tangible assets 
the insurance company portfolios also have a degree of international diversification through holdings of small capitalization value stocks in new zealand and australia  and selected large capitalization resource stocks with world class mining operations in foreign countries 
dividends and realized gains or losses from stocks held in the insurance company portfolios are reported in the insurance operations in run off segment

over time  the investment assets and investment income of a run off insurance company are expected to decline  as fixed income investments mature or are sold to provide the funds to pay down the company s claims reserves 
however  since the sale of sequoia closed on march   the investment assets of the insurance operations in run off segment have actually increased  as appreciation in stocks has more than offset the maturity or sale of fixed income securities to pay claims 
the financial results of insurance companies in run off can be volatile if there is favorable or unfavorable development in the loss reserves 
for example  in and physicians recorded significant income from favorable reserve development  but citation recorded a significant loss in  partly due to increases in the workers compensation and property and casualty insurance loss reserves 
physicians insurance company of ohio physicians wrote its last policy in  however  claims can be filed until resulting from events allegedly occurring during the period when physicians provided coverage 
by its nature  medical professional liability insurance involves a relatively small number frequency of relatively large severity claims 
we have purchased excess of loss reinsurance to limit our potential losses 
the amount of risk we have retained on each claim varies depending on the accident year but  in general  we are liable for the first million to million per claim 
due to the long tail ie  period of time between the occurrence of the alleged event giving rise to the claim  and the claim being reported to us in the medical professional liability insurance business  it is difficult to accurately quantify future claims liabilities and establish appropriate loss reserves 
our loss reserves are reviewed by management every quarter and are assessed in the fourth quarter of each year  based on independent actuarial analysis of past  current  and projected claims trends in the months ended september of each year 
at december   medical professional liability reserves totaled million  net of reinsurance  compared to million net of reinsurance at december   and million net of reinsurance at december  
table of contents physicians insurance company of ohio loss and loss adjustment expense reserves year ended december  direct reserves million million million ceded reserves net medical professional liability insurance reserves million million million at december   our direct reserves  or reserves before reinsurance  essentially equaled the independent actuary s best estimate 
the independent actuary is continually reviewing our claims experience and projected claims trends in order to arrive at the most accurate estimate possible 
the independent actuary did not explicitly forecast a range of reserves  but arrived at a best estimate through weighting the results of five different projection methods for each accident year  and in total 
under the different projection methods  the lowest direct reserve calculation was approximately million  and the highest direct reserve calculation was million 
consequently  our loss reserves could differ depending on the particular method of calculation chosen 
changes in assumptions about future claim trends  and the cost of handling claims  could lead to significant increases and decreases in our loss reserves 
when loss reserves are reduced  this is referred to as favorable development 
if loss reserves are increased  the development is referred to as adverse or unfavorable 
at december   approximately million  or of our direct reserves were case reserves  which are the loss reserves established when a claim is reported to us 
our provision for incurred but not reported claims ibnr  ie  the event giving rise to the claim has allegedly occurred  but the claim has not been reported to us was million  or of our direct reserves

although total claims payments in were less than anticipated  the average indemnity payment was higher than in and our future projection  due to the mix of cases closed in there were no changes in key actuarial assumptions in since it is almost ten years since physicians wrote its last policy  and the reserves for direct ibnr claims and unallocated loss adjustment expenses at december  are approximately million million net of reinsurance  it is conceivable that further favorable development could be recorded in future years if claims trends remain favorable  particularly claims severity 
however  given that favorable development of million was recorded in  there is less potential for favorable development in future years than there has been in the past  particularly as physicians remaining claims reserves get smaller 
in addition  we caution that claims can be reported until  and against over emphasizing claims count statistics for example  the last claims to be resolved by a run off insurance company could be the most complex and the most severe 

table of contents citation insurance company property and casualty insurance loss reserves citation went into run off from january  at december   after five years of run off  citation had million in property and casualty insurance loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  after reinsurance 
approximately of citation s net property and casualty insurance reserves are related to one line of business  artisans contractors liability insurance 
the remaining is comprised of commercial property and casualty insurance policies  all of which expired in as a general rule  based on state statutes of limitations  we believe that no new commercial property and casualty insurance claims can be filed in california and arizona  although in these states claims filing periods may be extended in certain limited circumstances 
we have purchased excess of loss reinsurance to limit our potential losses 
the amount of risk we have retained on each claim varies depending on the accident year  but we can be liable for the first  to  per claim 
citation wrote artisans contractors insurance until  the year before physicians merged with citation s parent company 
no artisans contractors business was renewed after the merger 
artisans contractors liability insurance has been a problematic line of business for all insurers who offered this type of coverage in california during the s and s 
california experienced a severe recession in the early s  which caused a steep downturn in real estate values 
in an attempt to improve their position  many homeowners filed claims against developers of new home communities and condominiums  and related parties such as general contractors  for alleged construction defects 
citation s average loss ratio ie  the cost of making provision to pay claims as a percentage of earned premium for all years from to for this insurance coverage is over 
the nature of this line of business is that we receive a large number high frequency of small low severity claims 
citation primarily insured subcontractors  and only rarely insured general contractors 
a large percentage of the claims received in   and related to additional insured endorsements aie 
in general  these represent claims from general contractors who were not direct policyholders of citation s  but were named as insureds on policies issued to citation s subcontractor policyholders 
most of citation s subcontractor insureds are not initially named as defendants in construction defect law suits  but are drawn into litigation against general contractors  typically when the general contractor s legal expenses reach the limit of their own insurance policy 
the courts have held that subcontractors who performed only a minor role in the construction can be held in on complicated litigation against general contractors 
accordingly  the cost of legal defenses can be as significant as claims payments 
typically  aie claims are shared among more than one subcontractor and more than one insurance carrier 
this reduces the expense to any one carrier  so aie claims typically involve smaller claims payments than claims from actual policyholders 
although citation wrote its last artisans contractors policy in and the statute of limitations in california is years  this can be extended in some situations 
over the past years  the trends in open claims and claims paid in the artisans contractors line of business has been year ended december  open claims at the start of the year new claims reported during the year claims closed during the year open claims at the end of the year total claims closed during the year claims closed with no payment claims closed with lae payment only no indemnity payment claims closed with an indemnity payment due to the long tail ie  period between the occurrence of the alleged event giving rise to the claim and the claim being reported to us in the artisans contractors line of business  it is difficult to accurately quantify future claims liabilities and establish appropriate loss reserves

we typically book our reserves to the actuary s best estimate 
changes in assumptions about future claim trends and the cost of handling claims can lead to significant increases and decreases in our property and casualty loss reserves

workers compensation loss reserves until  citation was a direct writer of workers compensation insurance in california  arizona  and nevada 
in  citation reinsured of its workers compensation business with a subsidiary  citation national insurance company cnic  and sold cnic to fremont indemnity company fremont 
as part of the sale of cnic  all assets and liabilities  including the assets which corresponded to the workers compensation reserves reinsured with cnic  and all records  computer systems  policy files  and reinsurance arrangements were transferred to fremont 
fremont merged cnic into fremont  and administered and paid all of the workers compensation claims which had been sold to it 
from until the second quarter of  citation booked the losses reported by fremont but recorded an equal and offsetting reinsurance recoverable from fremont as an admitted reinsurer for all losses and loss adjustment expenses 
this resulted in no net impact on citation s reserves and financial statements 

table of contents on july   the california superior court placed fremont in liquidation 
since fremont is in liquidation  it was no longer an admitted reinsurance company under the statutory basis of insurance accounting 
consequently  citation reversed the reinsurance recoverable from fremont of approximately million in its financial statements prepared on both the statutory basis and gaap basis in the second quarter of workers compensation has been a problematic line of business for all insurers who offered this type of coverage in california during the s 
we believe that this is primarily due to claims costs escalating at a greater than anticipated rate  in particular for medical care 
the nature of this line of business is that we receive a relatively small number low frequency of relatively large high severity claims 
although the last of citation s workers compensation policies expired in  new workers compensation claims can still be filed for events which allegedly occurred during the term of the policy 
the state statute of limitations is years  but claim filing periods may be extended in some circumstances 
at december   citation had open workers compensation claims  compared to open claims at both december  and december  during  new claims were filed  claims were reopened  and claims were closed 
during  claims were closed during the year  which were offset by an additional claims being allocated to citation from the fremont liquidation 
since citation ceased writing workers compensation coverage years ago  most of the claims which are still open tend to be severe  and likely to lead to claims payments for a prolonged period of time 
at december   citation had workers compensation reserves of million before reinsurance  and million after reinsurance 
citation purchased excess reinsurance to limit its potential losses in this line of business

following independent actuarial analysis at september  and december   citation increased its workers compensation net loss reserves by million  or approximately of million in net reserves at the start of this adverse development was primarily due to an increase in projected medical care costs  and an adjustment to reinsurance

following independent actuarial analysis at september  and december   citation increased its workers compensation net loss reserves by million  or approximately of the initial million in reserves

following is a description of what we believe to be the critical accounting policies affecting pico  and how we apply these policies 
estimation of reserves in insurance companies we must estimate future claims and ensure that our loss reserves are adequate to pay those claims 
this process requires us to make estimates about future events 
the accuracy of these estimates will not be known for many years 
for example  part of our claims reserves cover ibnr claims ie  the event giving rise to the claim has occurred  but the claim has not been reported to us 
in other words  in the case of ibnr claims  we must provide for claims which we do not know about yet 
at december   the loss reserves  net of reinsurance  of our two insurance subsidiaries were citation  million  and physicians  million 
physicians wrote its last policy in however  under current law  claims can be made until for events which allegedly occurred during the periods when we provided insurance coverage to medical professionals 
our medical professional liability insurance reserves are certified annually by an independent actuary  as required by ohio insurance law 
actuarial estimates of our future claims obligations have been volatile 
net reserves were reduced by million in   in and million in  after independent actuarial studies concluded that physicians claims reserves were greater than projected claims payments 
there can be no assurance that our claims reserves are adequate and that there will not be reserve increases or decreases in the future 
citation s loss reserves are reviewed regularly  and certified annually by an independent actuarial firm  as required by california insurance law 
in addition  we have to make judgments about the recoverability of reinsurance owed to us on direct claims reserves 
in making this assessment  we carefully review the creditworthiness of reinsurers  as well as relying on schedules in statutory filings with state departments of insurance which show separate deposits held as assets for the benefit of reinsureds 
as discussed on preceding pages in the insurance operations in run off section of item  during we booked a reversal of reinsurance recoverable of approximately million from fremont indemnity company  which fully reserved against the reinsurance recoverable from fremont 
see insurance operations in run off and regulatory insurance disclosure in item carrying value of long lived assets our principal long lived assets are real estate and water assets owned by vidler  and real estate at nevada land 
at december   the total carrying value of real estate and water assets was million  or of pico s total assets 
as required by gaap  our long lived assets are reviewed regularly to ensure that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from these assets will at least recover their carrying value 
our management conducts these reviews utilizing the most recent information available  however  the review process inevitably involves the significant use of estimates and assumptions  especially the estimated market values of our real estate and water assets 
in our water resource and water storage business  we develop some projects and assets from scratch 
this can require cash outflows eg  to drill wells to prove that water is available in situations where there is no guarantee that the project will ultimately be commercially viable 
if we determine that it is probable that the project will be commercially viable  the costs of developing the asset are capitalized ie  recorded as an asset in our balance sheet  rather than being charged as an expense 
if the project ends up being viable  in the case of a sale  the capitalized costs are included in the cost of real estate and water assets sold and applied against the purchase price 
in the case of a lease transaction  or when the asset is fully developed and ready for use  the capitalized costs are amortized ie  charged as an expense in our income statement and match any related revenues 
if we determine that the carrying value of an asset cannot be justified by the forecast future cash flows of that asset  the carrying value of the asset is written down to fair value immediately  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accounting for investments and investments in unconsolidated affiliates at december   pico and its subsidiaries held equities with a carrying value of approximately million 
these holdings are primarily small capitalization value stocks listed in the us  switzerland  new zealand  and australia 
depending on the circumstances  and our judgment about the level of our involvement with the investee company  we apply one of two accounting policies 
in the case of most holdings  we apply sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
under this method  the investment is carried at market value in our balance sheet  with unrealized gains or losses being included in shareholders equity  and the only income recorded being from dividends 
in the case of investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the company we have invested in  we apply the equity method under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the application of the equity method apb no 
to an investment may result in a different outcome in our financial statements than market value accounting sfas no 

the most significant difference between the two policies is that  under the equity method  we include our proportionate share of the investee s earnings or losses in our statement of operations  and dividends received are used to reduce the carrying value of the investment in our balance sheet 
under market value accounting  the only income recorded is from dividends received 
the assessment of what constitutes the ability to exercise significant influence requires our management to make significant judgments 
we look at various factors in making this determination 
these include our percentage ownership of voting stock  whether or not we have representation on the investee company s board of directors  transactions between us and the investee  the ability to obtain timely quarterly financial information  and whether pico management can affect the operating and financial policies of the investee company 
when we conclude that we have this kind of influence  we adopt the equity method and change all of our previously reported results from the investee to show the investment as if we had applied equity accounting from the date of our first purchase 
this adds volatility to our reported results 
the use of market value accounting or the equity method can result in significantly different carrying values at specific balance sheet dates  and contributions to our statement of operations in any individual year during the course of the investment 
the total impact of the investment on pico s shareholders equity over the entire life of the investment will be the same whichever method is adopted 
for equity and debt securities accounted for under sfas no 
which are in an unrealized loss position in local currency terms  we regularly review whether the decline in market value is other than temporary 
in general  this review requires management to consider several factors  including specific adverse conditions affecting the investee s business and industry  the financial condition of the investee  the long term prospects of the investee  and the extent and duration of the decline in market value of the investee 
accordingly  management has to make important assumptions regarding our intent and ability to hold the security  and our assessment of the overall worth of the security 
risks and uncertainties in our methodology for reviewing unrealized losses for other than temporary declines include our judgments regarding the overall worth of the issuer and its long term prospects  and our ability to realize on our assessment of the overall worth of the business 
in a subsequent quarterly review  if we conclude that an unrealized loss previously determined to be temporary is other than temporary  an impairment loss will be recorded 
the other than temporary impairment charge will have no impact on shareholders equity or book value per share  as the decline in market value will already have been recorded through shareholders equity 
however  there will be an impact on reported income before and after tax and on our earnings per share  due to recognition of the unrealized loss and related tax effects 
when a charge for other than temporary impairment is recorded  our basis in the security is decreased 
consequently  if the market value of the security later recovers and we sell the security  a correspondingly greater gain will be recorded in the statement of operations 
these accounting treatments for investments and investments in unconsolidated affiliates add volatility to our statements of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on the sale of real estate and water rights based on the guidance of fasb no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
specifically  we recognize revenue when a there is a legally binding sale contract  b the profit is determinable ie  the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured  or any amount that will not be collectable can be estimated  c the earnings process is virtually complete ie  we are not obliged to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit  meaning we have transferred all risks and rewards to the buyer  and d the buyer s initial and continuing investment are sufficient to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property 
unless all of these conditions are met  we use the deposit method of accounting 
under the deposit method of accounting  until the conditions to fully recognize a sale are met  payments received from the buyer are recorded as liabilities and no gain is recognized

since the date of closing determines the accounting period in which the sales revenue and gross margin are recorded  vidler s reported revenues and income fluctuate from period to period depending on the dates when specific transactions close

we do not sell holdings on a regular basis 
a holding may be sold if the price of a security has significantly exceeded our target  or if there have been changes which we believe limit further appreciation potential on a risk adjusted basis 
consequently  the amount of net realized gains or losses recognized during any accounting period has no predictive value 
in addition  in this segment various income items relate to specific investments held during a particular accounting period 
since our investments change over time  results in this segment are not necessarily comparable from year to year 
in  net realized gains were million  the largest of which was a million realized gain on the sale of part of our holding in raetia energie ag 
these realized gains were partially offset by a  charge for other than temporary impairment of our holding in a swiss public company  to reflect a decline in the market value of that stock during in  net realized gains were  net realized gains on the sale or impairment of holdings were  this primarily represented realized gains of million on the sale of a domestic stock and million on the sale of two unrelated foreign stocks  which were largely offset by charges of million for other than temporary impairment of our holding in accu holding ag during  and  for impairment of our holding in sihl during in addition  a  charge  to reduce the carrying value of our hyperfeed warrants to zero  was recorded as a realized loss in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in  net realized gains of million were recorded 
this primarily represented million in realized gains on the sale of two unrelated foreign stocks 
in addition  income of  was recorded under sfas no 
 primarily representing an increase in the estimated fair value of hyperfeed warrants during we regularly review any securities in which we have an unrealized loss 
if we determine that the decline in market value is other than temporary  under gaap we record a charge to reduce the basis of the security from its original cost to current carrying value  which is usually the market price at the balance sheet date when the provision is recorded 
the determination is based on various factors  including the extent and the duration of the unrealized loss 
a charge for other than temporary impairment is a non cash charge  which is recorded as a realized loss 
it should be noted that charges for other than temporary impairments do not affect book value per share  as the after tax decline in the market value of investments carried under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  is already reflected in shareholders equity in our balance sheet  and the carrying book value of the holding does not change 
the impairment simply reclassifies the decline from an unrealized decrease in shareholders equity to a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
the written down value becomes our new basis in the investment 
in future accounting periods  unrealized gains or losses from that basis will be recorded in shareholders equity  and when the investment is sold a realized gain or loss from that basis will be recorded in the statement of operations 
for example  during and we sold our holding in mc shipping  inc although this resulted in realized gains of million under gaap in and  the gains only recovered part of a charge for other than temporary impairment of this holding recorded in in this segment  investment income includes interest on cash and short term fixed income securities  and dividends from partially owned businesses 
investment income totaled million in  million in  and million in investment income fluctuates depending on the level of cash and temporary investments  the level of interest rates  and the dividends paid by partially owned businesses 
pico s equity share of investees income loss represents our proportionate share of the net income loss and other events affecting equity in the investments which we carry under the equity method  less any dividends received from those investments 
we did not carry any investments under the equity method in and in  our equity share of investees losses  principally hyperfeed  was  total segment expenses were million in  million in  and million in the expenses recognized in this segment primarily consist of holding company costs which are not allocated to our other segments  most notably stock appreciation rights sar expense  pico s corporate overhead  and the us dollar change in value of a swiss franc inter company loan

six of pico s officers participate in an incentive compensation program tied to growth in the company s book value per share relative to a pre determined threshold  other parent company overhead of million  and a million expense resulting from the effect of depreciation in the swiss franc on the inter company loan during our interests in swiss public companies are held by global equity ag  a wholly owned subsidiary which is incorporated in switzerland 
part of global equity ag s funding comes from a loan from pico  which is denominated in swiss francs 
during accounting periods when the swiss franc appreciates relative to the us dollar such as and under gaap we are required to record a benefit through the statement of operations to reflect the fact that global equity ag owes pico more us dollars 
in global equity ag s financial statements  an equivalent debit is included in the foreign currency translation component of shareholders equity since it owes pico more dollars  however  this does not go through the statement of operations 
during accounting periods when the swiss franc depreciates relative to the us dollar such as opposite entries are made and an expense is recorded in the statement of operations 
accordingly  we were required to record an expense of million before tax in our statement of operations in  even though there was no net impact on shareholders equity  before any related tax effects 
since  the change in the in the money amount ie  the difference between the market value of pico stock and the exercise price of the sar of sar outstanding during each accounting period has been recorded through the consolidated statement of operations 
an increase in the in the money amount of sar ie  if the price of pico stock rises during the accounting period was recorded as an expense 
during  in conjunction with the company entering into new employment agreements with its chairman and president ceo  pico s compensation committee retained an independent compensation expert to review the various components of executive compensation 
the independent compensation expert suggested a number of changes to the existing compensation programs  particularly in light of new accounting pronouncements concerning stock based compensation  and recent developments in the law relating to executive compensation  both of which have changed significantly since the programs were introduced 
after receiving the consultant s report  the company s compensation committee elected to amend the sar program  and to replace it with a stock based incentive plan  the pico holdings  inc long term incentive plan the incentive plan  which was approved by the company s shareholders on december  on september   the sar program was amended  and the spread value of the sar outstanding was monetized based on the last sale price of pico stock on that date 
this resulted in a million expense to record the increase in sar liability from the start of through september   which comprised our total sar expense for during  excluding new shares issued  pico s equity market capitalization increased by approximately million

no expense was recorded in related to the incentive plan as the pico stock price was below the exercise price at the end of in  sar expense was million  consisting of a million increase in sar liability  and  in payments on the exercise of sar

our cash flow position fluctuates depending on the requirements of our operating subsidiaries for capital  and activity in our insurance company investment portfolios 
our primary sources of funds include cash balances  cash flow from operations  the sale of holdings  and potentially the proceeds of borrowings or offerings of equity and debt 
in broad terms  the cash flow profile of our principal operating subsidiaries is as vidler s water assets are monetized  vidler is generating free cash flow as receipts from the sale of water rights and land have overtaken maintenance capital expenditure  financing costs  and operating expenses  nevada land is actively selling land which has reached its highest and best use 
nevada land s principal sources of cash flow are the proceeds of cash sales  and collections of principal and interest on sales contracts where nevada land has provided vendor financing 
these receipts and other revenues significantly exceed nevada land s operating costs  so nevada land is generating strong cash flow  investment income more than covers the operating expenses of the run off insurance companies  physicians and citation

in addition  lincoln vidler s sale of  acre feet of water resulted in an operating cash flow to vidler of approximately million 
due to the income recognized on these sales  we paid million in estimated federal and state taxes in all other operating activities resulted in an operating cash outflow of approximately million  in  the collection of million of principal on two collateralized notes receivable  related to vidler s sale of assets at big springs ranch and west wendover in  and million from cash land sales by nevada land  in  approximately million in proceeds of land and related assets sold by nevada land  and million from the cash portion of two significant sales of land and related assets by vidler

the remaining cash flow items principally reflect the net investment of million in fixed income securities and million in marketable equity securities  and the payment of million in cash to acquire additional shares of hyperfeed 
the net investment in fixed income securities represents routine activity in the investment portfolios of our insurance companies  and the temporary investment of surplus funds in fixed income securities

in  financing activities provided cash of million 
this was principally due to a million increase in swiss franc borrowings to fund additional purchases of stocks in switzerland  which was partially offset by the repayment of million in borrowings by vidler

 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement revised is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the annual period that begins after june  the new statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in statement as originally issued and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost should be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
as all of the stock settled sars granted under pico s plan were fully vested at december   no stock based compensation will be recorded for these awards under sfas r 
if and when pico grants additional awards  the fair value of such awards will be recognized and recorded over the vesting period 
in march  fasb issued interpretation number  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
which clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
statement acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
there was no effect of adoption of the statement on the accompanying consolidated financial statement of the company 

table of contents regulatory insurance disclosures liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are estimated based upon actual and industry experience  and assumptions and projections as to claims frequency  severity and inflationary trends and settlement payments 
such estimates may vary from the eventual outcome 
the inherent uncertainty in estimating reserves is particularly acute for lines of business for which both reported and paid losses develop over an extended period of time 
several years or more may elapse between the occurrence of an insured medical professional liability insurance or casualty loss or workers compensation claim  the reporting of the loss and the final payment of the loss 
loss reserves are estimates of what an insurer expects to pay claimants  legal and investigative costs and claims administrative costs 
pico s insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves for payment of estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported claims and claims which have occurred but have not yet been reported 
ultimate actual liabilities may be materially more or less than current reserve estimates 
reserves for reported claims are established on a case by case basis 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  the regulatory environment  benefit levels  economic conditions  judicial administration of claims  general trends in claim severity and frequency  medical costs and other factors which could affect the adequacy of loss reserves 
management reviews and adjusts incurred but not reported claims reserves regularly 
the liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of physicians and citation were million at december   million at december  and million at december  before reinsurance reserves  which reduce net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
of those amounts  the liabilities for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses of prior years decreased by million in  increased by  in and increased by million in see note of notes to pico s consolidated financial statements  reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses for additional information regarding reserve changes 
although insurance reserves are certified annually by independent actuaries for each insurance company as required by state law  significant fluctuations in reserve levels can occur based upon a number of variables used in actuarial projections of ultimate incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses 

table of contents analysis of loss and loss adjustment expense development the following table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for through for all continuing operations property and casualty and workers compensation lines of business and medical professional liability insurance 
the net liability as originally estimated line shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded at the balance sheet date on a discounted basis  prior to  for each of the indicated years 
reserves for other lines of business that physicians ceased writing in  which are immaterial  are excluded 
the gross liability as originally estimated represents the estimated amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date on an undiscounted basis  including losses that had been incurred but not reported 
in thousands net liability as originally estimated discount gross liability as originally estimated cumulative payments as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later liability re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative redundancy deficiency year ended december  in thousands net liability as originally estimated discount gross liability before discount as originally estimated cumulative payments as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later liability re estimated as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later cumulative redundancy deficiency reconciliation to financial statements gross liability end of year reinsurance recoverable net liability end of year reinsurance recoverable discontinued personal lines insurance liability to california insurance guarantee association for workers compensation payouts balance sheet liability gross re estimated liability latest re estimated recoverable latest net re estimated liability latest net cumulative redundancy each decrease or increase includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods 
for example  the amount of the redundancy related to losses settled in  but incurred in  will be included in the decrease or increase amount for  and conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
for example  physicians commuted reinsurance contracts in several different years that significantly increased the estimate of net reserves for prior years by reducing the recoverable loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for those years 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future increases or decreases based on this table 
the data in the above table is based on schedule p from each of physician s and citation s to annual statements  as filed with state insurance departments  however  the development table above differs from the development displayed in schedule p  part  of the insurance annual statements as schedule p  part  excludes unallocated loss adjustment expenses 
loss reserve experience the inherent uncertainties in estimating loss reserves are greater for some insurance products than for others  and are dependent on the length of the reporting lag or tail associated with a given product ie  the lapse of time between the occurrence of a claim and the report of the claim to the insurer  on the diversity of historical development patterns among various aggregations of claims  the amount of historical information available during the estimation process  the degree of impact that changing regulations and legal precedents may have on open claims  and the consistency of reinsurance programs over time  among other things 
because medical professional liability insurance  commercial casualty and workers compensation claims may not be fully paid for several years or more  estimating reserves for such claims can be more uncertain than estimating reserves in other lines of insurance 
as a result  precise reserve estimates cannot be made for several years following a current accident year for which reserves are initially established 

table of contents there can be no assurance that the insurance companies have established reserves that are adequate to meet the ultimate cost of losses arising from such claims 
it has been necessary  and will over time continue to be necessary  for the insurance companies to review and make appropriate adjustments to reserves for estimated ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses 
to the extent reserves prove to be inadequate  the insurance companies would have to adjust their reserves and incur a charge to income  which could have a material adverse effect on pico s statement of operations and financial condition

workers compensation insurance through citation insurance company claims and liabilities related to the insolvency of fremont indemnity company in  pursuant to a quota share reinsurance agreement the reinsurance agreement  citation ceded its california workers compensation insurance liabilities to citation national insurance company cnic and transferred all administrative services relating to these liabilities to fremont 
the reinsurance agreement became effective upon fremont s acquisition  with approval from the california department of insurance the department  of cnic on or about june  thereafter  on or about december   cnic merged  with department approval  with and into fremont 
accordingly  since january   fremont has been both the reinsurer and the administrator of the california workers compensation business ceded by citation 
during the period from june  the date on which citation ceded its workers compensation insurance liabilities through july  the date on which fremont was placed in liquidation  fremont maintained a workers compensation insurance securities deposit in california for the benefit of claimants under workers compensation insurance policies issued  or assumed  by fremont 
concurrent with fremont s posting of the portion of the total deposit that related to citation s insureds  citation reduced its own workers compensation insurance reserves by the amount of that deposit 
on june   the superior court of the state of california for the county of los angeles the liquidation court entered an order of conservation over fremont and appointed the california department of insurance commissioner the commissioner as the conservator 
pursuant to such order  the commissioner was granted authority to take possession of all of fremont s assets  including its rights in the deposit for citation s insureds 
shortly thereafter  on july   the liquidation court entered an order appointing the commissioner as the liquidator of fremont s estate 
shortly thereafter  citation concluded that  because fremont had been placed in liquidation  citation was no longer entitled to take a reinsurance credit for the deposit for citation s insureds under the statutory basis of accounting 
consequently  citation reversed the million reinsurance recoverable from fremont in its june  financial statements prepared on the statutory basis of accounting 
in addition  citation made a corresponding provision for the reinsurance recoverable from fremont at june  for gaap purposes 
in june  citation filed litigation against the california department of insurance in the superior court of california to recover its workers compensation trust deposits held by fremont prior to fremont s liquidation 
in september  the superior court ruled against citation s action 
as a result  citation did not receive any distribution from the california insurance guarantee association or fremont and will not receive any credit for the deposit held by fremont for citation s insureds 
in consideration of the potential cost and the apparent limited prospect of obtaining relief  citation decided not to file an appeal

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pico s balance sheets include a significant amount of assets and liabilities the fair value of which are subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market interest rates or prices 
pico currently has interest rate risk as it relates to its fixed maturity securities and mortgage participation interests  equity price risk as it relates to its marketable equity securities  and foreign currency risk as it relates to investments denominated in foreign currencies 
generally  pico s borrowings are short to medium term in nature and therefore approximate fair value 
at december   pico had million of fixed maturity securities and mortgage participation interests  million of marketable equity securities that were subject to market risk  of which million were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily swiss francs 
pico s investment strategy is to manage the duration of the portfolio relative to the duration of the liabilities while managing interest rate risk 
pico uses two models to report the sensitivity of its assets and liabilities subject to the above risks 
for its fixed maturity securities and mortgage participation interests  pico uses duration modeling to calculate changes in fair value 
for its marketable securities  pico uses a hypothetical decrease in the fair value to analyze the sensitivity of its market risk assets and liabilities 
for investments denominated in foreign currencies  pico uses a hypothetical decrease in the local currency of that investment 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical results assumed in this disclosure due to possible actions taken by management to mitigate adverse changes in fair value and because the fair value of securities may be affected by credit concerns of the issuer  prepayment rates  liquidity  and other general market conditions 
the sensitivity analysis duration model produced a loss in fair value of million for a basis point decline in interest rates on pico s fixed securities and mortgage participation interests 
the hypothetical decrease in fair value of pico s marketable equity securities produced a loss in fair value of million before tax  that would impact the unrealized appreciation in shareholders equity 
the hypothetical decrease in the local currency of pico s foreign denominated investments produced a loss of million that would impact the foreign currency translation in shareholders equity
