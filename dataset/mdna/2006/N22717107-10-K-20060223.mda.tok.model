item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation core laboratories nv is a netherlands limited liability company 
we were established in and are one of the world s leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description  production enhancement and reservoir management products and services to the oil and gas industry  primarily through customer relationships with many of the world s major  national and independent oil companies 
our business units have been aggregated into three complementary segments reservoir description encompasses the characterization of petroleum reservoir rock  fluid and gas samples 
we provide analytical and field services to characterize properties of crude oil and petroleum products to the oil and gas industry 
production enhancement includes products and services relating to reservoir well completions  perforations  stimulations and production 
we provide integrated services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects 
reservoir management combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients reservoirs 
in april  we sold our specialized geophysical and seismic related business  which was previously included as a component of our reservoir management business 
we recorded a loss of million  net of tax  related to this discontinued operation during the year ended december  all comparative information presented for has been restated to exclude this business line 
general overview we provide services and design and produce products which enable our clients to evaluate reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields 
these services and products are generally in higher demand when our clients are investing capital in exploration and development efforts to explore new fields or to increase productivity in existing fields 
our clients investment in capital expenditure programs tends to correlate to oil and natural gas commodity prices 
during periods of higher prices  our clients generally invest more in capital expenditures and  during periods of lower commodity prices  they tend to invest less 
accordingly  the level of capital expenditures by our clients impacts the demand for our services and products 
commodity prices for natural gas and crude oil rose throughout  as the price of a barrel of crude oil reached record highs 
consequently  activity levels in the oilfield service sector increased during the year 
rig count improved in the us markets throughout the year  and  to a lesser extent  rig count improved outside the united states 
the following table summarizes the average worldwide and us rig counts for the years ended december   and  as well as the spot price of a barrel of west texas intermediate crude and an mcf of natural gas at the dates then ended rig count oil and gas prices as of december  worldwide rig count us rig count crude oil price per barrel wti spot natural gas price spot average per mcf baker hughes incorporated world wide averages obtained from lehman brothers the original oil service monthly for and the us department of energy henry hub spot price at per the new york mercantile exchange the price of natural gas in continued to increase throughout the year when compared with the price in and these higher prices were attributable to various market factors including a general decline in natural gas production in recent years  evidenced by lower production rates from maturing fields and combined with steeper decline curves from newly discovered fields 
general oil and gas market conditions in the united states improved and contributed to general price increases for oil and gas products in oil prices per barrel of unrefined crude continued to climb to record levels due to increased demand and concerns over global supply 
our activity levels continue to increase as oilfield activities by our customers increase 
these higher activity levels resulted in increased revenues for us in  primarily for our reservoir description and production enhancement business segments 
given these higher revenues  in conjunction with efforts to contain our cost structure  we were able to generate operating income that was greater than the prior year 
our reservoir description segment showed improvement in almost all operations  primarily as a result of the spending levels of our clients aimed at characterizing and analyzing reservoirs  crude oil  and derivative products 
operating income from our production enhancement segment was up over the prior year as more wells in north america were drilled and stimulated than in the prior year  which provides greater opportunity for our clients to use our products and services 
in april  we sold our seismic business  which had become less profitable in recent years  due to increased competition which contributed to lower margins 
the results for our reservoir management group improved over prior year due primarily to a re focus of our efforts on integrated solutions for clients 
outlook we continue our efforts to expand our market presence by opening strategic facilities and realizing synergies within our business lines 
as companies in the oil and gas industry consolidate  some of our clients have used  and may continue to use  their global presence and market influence to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions 
we believe our market presence provides us a unique opportunity to service these customers 
we have established internal earnings targets that are based on current market conditions 
based on discussions with our clients and our view of the industry  we anticipate that in north american spending by our clients will increase approximately  in line with increases in we believe that the activity levels outside of north america will increase compared to levels as we expand our international revenue base through direct product sales and technical services 
however  attaining our internal targets is dependent on sustained north american and international oilfield activity 
we expect to meet ongoing working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and funding of our share repurchase program from a combination of cash on hand  cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the us and require us to make estimates and assumptions during their preparation which requires judgment 
our accounting policies and procedures are explained in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following transaction types require significant judgment and  therefore  are considered critical accounting policies as of december  revenue recognition revenues are recognized as services are completed or as product title is transferred 
all advance client payments are classified as unearned revenues until services are performed or product title is transferred 
we recognize revenue when we determine that the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from long term contracts are recorded as services are rendered in proportion to the work performed 
all known or anticipated losses on contracts are provided for currently 
training and consulting service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
we apply the provisions of the emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to account for certain contracts with identifiable units of accounting 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and monitor collections and payments in order to maintain a provision for estimated uncollectible accounts based on our historical collection experience and our current aging of client receivables outstanding in addition to clients representations and our understanding of the economic environment in which our clients operate 
based on our review  we establish or adjust allowances for specific customers and the accounts receivable as a whole 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million compared to million at december  long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill property  plant and equipment are carried at cost 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the respective asset s remaining useful life 
maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred 
when long lived assets are sold or retired  the remaining costs and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in income 
property  plant and equipment held and used is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable over the remaining service life 
indicators of possible impairment include extended periods of idle use or significant declines in activity levels in regions where specific assets or groups of assets are located 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when the net book value of the assets  or carrying value  is determined to be unrecoverable and the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value requires estimates of future cash flows  and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
we did not record impairment charges related to our long lived assets held for use in continuing operations during the years ended december   or we review our goodwill  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations  at least annually for impairment or more frequently if an event occurs which may indicate impairment during the year 
we evaluated assets with indefinite lives  including goodwill and certain intangible assets  for impairment comparing the fair value of our reportable segments to their net carrying value as of the balance sheet date  after excluding inter company transactions and allocating corporate assets to the reportable segments 
fair value is determined by projecting future cash flows on a discounted basis 
if the carrying value of the reportable segment exceeds the fair value determined  impairment may be indicated 
if impairment is indicated  the fair value of the reportable segment would be determined 
any remaining goodwill would be deemed impaired and charged to income during the period the impairment was identified 
any subsequent impairment loss c ould result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
inventory valuation allowances our valuation reserve for inventory is based on historical regional sales trends  and various other assumptions and judgments including future demand for this inventory 
should these assumptions and judgments not occur  our valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect actual results 
our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  if we over or underestimate demand for inventory  it could result in a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes our income tax expense includes income taxes of the netherlands  the us and other foreign countries as well as local  state and provincial income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the differences between the financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the asset is recovered or the liability is settled 
any valuation allowance recorded is based on estimates and assumptions of taxable income into the future and a determination is made of the magnitude of deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances of our net deferred tax assets aggregated million and million at december  and  respectively 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
stock options we apply accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which does not require us to recognize compensation costs related to employee stock options which have exercise prices at least equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant 
accordingly  we have not recognized compensation cost for our stock options issued 
we have  however  included option shares in the diluted shares outstanding calculation that is used to determine diluted earnings per share 
we are not required to account for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accounting for our stock based compensation plans using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations  as it requires that the fair value of stock options issued be estimated using pricing models that have an inherent degree of uncertainty  and that expense be recognized over the vesting period of the related options 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revises sfas no 
and supersedes abp opinion no 
this statement will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  with limited exceptions 
we have adopted this statement as of january  as of december   we have no unvested stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r had minimal impact on our financial statements 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and determine the adequacy of our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
by nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it is highly subjective and if changes in the estimate under different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following table summarizes key estimates and assumptions used to prepare our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and account nature of estimates required assumptions used allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate whether client receivables are collectible 
see allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves we forecast client demand  considering changes in technology which could result in obsolescence 
see inventory valuation allowances 
depreciation and amortization we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
useful lives assigned reflect our best estimate based on historical data of the respective asset s useful life and salvage value 
these assets could become impaired if our operating plans or business environment changes 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we utilize an actuary to determine the value of the projected benefit obligation under a dutch pension plan 
this valuation requires various estimates and assumptions concerning mortality  future pay increases and discount rate used to value our obligations 
in addition  we recognize net periodic benefit cost based upon these estimates 
the actuarial assumptions used are based upon professional judgment and historical experience  including trends in mortality rates  and credit market rates discount rate 
stock based compensation we evaluate the probability that certain of our stock based plans will meet targets established within the respective agreements and result in the vesting of such awards 
see stock based compensation 
comparisons to either our stock price  a return on our stock price compared to certain stock indices or a return on equity calculation 
income taxes we estimate the likelihood of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets particularly  net operating loss carry forwards 
see income taxes 
we examine our historical and projected operating results  review the eligible carry forward period and tax planning opportunities and consider other relevant information 
changes in tax laws for the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly impact our estimates 
long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of our assets periodically  but at least annually  by examining current and projected operating results to identify any triggering events  which may indicate impairment 
we compare the carrying value of the assets to a projection of fair value  utilizing judgment as to the identification of reporting units  the allocation of corporate assets amongst reporting units and the determination of the appropriate discount rate 
see long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill 
our impairment analysis is subjective and includes estimates based on assumptions regarding future growth rates and operating expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements we hold investments in unconsolidated affiliates whose operations are in line with those of our core businesses 
our investment and operating percentages in these entities are included in our consolidated financial statements 
these entities are not considered special purpose entities nor do we have special off balance sheet arrangements through these entities 
they are not consolidated due to the limited influence we have in making management decisions 
results of operations results of operations as a percentage of applicable revenues are as follows dollars in thousands year ended change revenues services product sales operating expenses cost of services cost of sales total cost of services and sales general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization other expense income  net operating income debt prepayment charge interest expense income before income tax expense income tax expense income from continuing operations discontinued operations nm nm net income percentage based on applicable revenue rather than total revenue 
nm means not meaningful 
operating results for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and we evaluate our operating results by analyzing revenues  operating income margin defined as operating income divided by total revenue and income margin defined as income from continuing operations divided by total revenue 
since we have a relatively fixed cost structure  increases in revenues generally translate into higher operating income margin and income margin percentages 
results for the years ended december   and are summarized in the following chart

service revenues service revenues increased to million for from million for and million for these year over year increases in service revenues were largely attributable to an overall increase in worldwide oilfield activities and increasing oil and gas commodity prices 
the average north american operating rig count increased to  for from  for and  for  as derived from published reports from baker hughes incorporated 
this overall increase in drilling related activity and in commodity prices created greater demand for our services 
our revenues increased in primarily as a result of greater demand across all three business segments from increased oilfield activities in north america  europe  west africa and the far east 
for compared to  our service revenue increases were primarily related to our operations in the united states and canada  largely attributable to sales of diagnostic services and fluid characterization  in those countries and increased revenues in europe and south america 
product sale revenues product sale revenues increased to million for from million for and million for these incremental improvements in revenue were consistent with the higher revenues we experienced for our services  represent a year over year increase for the period ended december   and were largely attributable to the overall increase in north american oilfield activities  principally as a result of an increase in drilling activity for natural gas 
as a result  we experienced higher demand for our well completion products 
cost of services cost of services increased to million for from million for and million for when is compared to as a percentage of service revenue  cost of services decreased by two percentage points 
this decrease was primarily a result of incremental margins earned on higher revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure 
for compared to  the percentage increases in cost of services were consistent with the percentage increases in service revenues for the respective periods 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million for from million for and million for as a percentage of product sale revenues  cost of sales decreased to for compared to for and for the improvement in margin for compared to and for compared to was largely attributable to efforts in and to enhance our manufacturing efficiencies from an increase in sales and improved inventory management 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses include corporate management and centralized administrative services that benefit our operating subsidiaries 
our general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to this increase was primarily associated with stock based compensation plans relating to our improved performance in  which attributed million to the increase  as well as higher accounting fees of million related to the implementation of rule of the sarbanes oxley act of and various other elements 
general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to  primarily associated with stock based compensation plans and increased outside services and consulting costs incurred to assist us with documentation and assessment of the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to this decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a general run off of depreciation expense associated with older assets offset by an increase in capital expenditures in depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to this decline in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily associated with reduced capital expenditures in compared to  and a general run off of depreciation expense associated with older assets 
other expense income  net the components of other expense income  net  were as follows in thousands year ended minority interest gain loss on sale of assets equity in income loss of affiliates foreign exchange loss gain interest income gain on involuntary sale of asset gain on insurance recovery other total other expense income  net in  the british government notified us that it would exercise its right of eminent domain thereby involuntarily acquiring the property of one of our operating facilities 
prior to december   we received an initial payment from the british government for million as compensation for this property 
in the second quarter of  we negotiated and received a final settlement which resulted in a million gain 
during the first quarter of  a building at our manufacturing plant in godley  texas  was damaged by fire  resulting in the loss of the building  some inventory  as well as other business equipment and supplies 
in june  we filed claims with our insurance carrier for reimbursement of these costs resulting in a net gain of million 
we filed a claim for business interruption costs associated with this fire during the third quarter and expect to settle these claims during no impact from the claim for the business interruption has been recorded in the results of operations as of december  debt prepayment charge in december  we repaid our senior notes 
in connection with the early prepayment  we incurred a prepayment penalty of million 
see credit facilities and available future liquidity 
interest expense interest expense remained basically unchanged in compared to  due to higher borrowing rates under our long term revolving credit facility  which increased to an average of for compared to an average of for  which was offset by a lower outstanding balance 
interest expense increased million in compared to  due to higher borrowing rates under our long term revolving credit facility  which increased to an average of for compared to an average of for income tax expense income tax expense increased million in compared to this increase was due to an increase in income before income taxes of million coupled with an increase in the effective tax rate for the year 
the effective tax rate was for  for and for the change in the tax rate is primarily a result of more earnings in relatively higher tax rate jurisdictions 
for  income tax expense increased million compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in net income before income taxes of million 
discontinued operations as a result of the sale of our seismic business in april  we recorded a loss for discontinued operations totaling million  net of tax 
this loss included charges related to the impairment of goodwill  certain intangible assets and other long lived assets totaling million and a charge of million to the provision for doubtful accounts  as well as other working capital adjustments 
in  results related to the discontinued operations resulted in a loss of million 
in  we finalized the terms under the contract for sale of the business through a negotiated payment of million  net of taxes

nm means not meaningful segment operating income loss margins for the years ended december  margin margin margin reservoir description production enhancement reservoir management total company calculated by dividing operating income loss by revenue 
reservoir description revenues for our reservoir description segment increased by in compared to  and grew in compared to these revenue increases resulted from increased oilfield activity during recent years 
a significant portion of the revenues earned by this business segment are derived from core samples tested and inspection services performed for oil and gas industry clients 
we experienced an increase in demand for our reservoir rock analysis as well as our fluid analysis services in north america  west africa  middle east and the far east 
revenues were also positively impacted by increased demand for out fluid characterization services in europe 
for compared to  we experienced higher revenues in north america  europe and the far east  partially offset by a revenue decline in mexico  where several contracts expired 
revenue growth in north america was primarily attributable to increased demand for our inspection and analysis services by our clients as well as demand for core analysis throughout north america 
revenue increases in europe and the far east were primarily due to improved economic conditions in the sectors where our clients operate  which resulted in increased demand for our inspection and analysis services 
operating income and operating income margin for the reservoir description segment increased due to continued growth of higher value added and higher margin products which resulted in increases in margins throughout the majority of the regions with significant increases in europe and improvements in operating results in mexico 
for compared to  operating income increased primarily as a result of incremental margins earned on higher revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure 
increases in north america and europe more than offset operating income declines in mexico and certain regions of the former soviet union  where we continued to experience margin erosion due to increased competition 
production enhancement revenues for our production enhancement business segment grew in compared to  primarily due to the introduction of new technology and to the increase in north america natural gas drilling activity in relative to with the increase in drilling activities  the demand for our well perforating and completion products and diagnostic services has also increased  the primary products and services offered by this segment 
revenues increased by in compared to  primarily due to the introduction of new technology and as a result of increased oilfield activities in north america  resulting in higher demand for our perforating gun systems and hydraulic fracture diagnostic services 
operating income for this segment increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in was due to increased sales of higher margin services and products including new enhanced recovery technology  such as spectrascan  spectrachem and our hero perforating charges and gun systems  as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies 
additionally  the demand for the company s technology in fracture diagnostics continued to increase as drilling activity increased in unconventional reservoirs 
the increase in operating income margin to in compared to in was due primarily to manufacturing efficiencies which contributed to incremental margins earned on revenues over our relatively fixed cost structure and a more favorable product mix 
the product mix in was impacted by increased sales of higher margin services and products including new enhanced recovery technology  such as spectraflood  and ou r hero perforating charge and gun systems 
reservoir management revenues for our reservoir management segment increased by in compared to and in compared to the continued increase was due to higher revenue for multi client reservoir studies  especially studies pertaining to unconventional gas reservoirs  and increased international demand for our reservoir monitoring systems 
significant studies in were reservoir characterization and production properties of gas shales and geological  petrophysical  and geomechanical properties of tight gas sands and in they included a regional study of the reservoir lithologies from fields and basins in libya  as well as reservoir quality  reservoir quality prediction and seal rock evaluation deep shelf gulf of mexico and several other proprietary studies 
operating income for this segment increased in compared to primarily due to incremental margins earned from the continued expansion of the multi client reservoir study sales in the us and expansion of studies being performed off the coast of africa 
operating income for this segment increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in revenues from our integrated multi disciplinary studies  and participation of our clients in those projects 
liquidity and capital resources general we have historically financed our activities through cash on hand  cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities  equity financing and the issuance of debt 
cash flow from operating activities provides the primary source of funds to finance operating needs  capital expenditures and our share repurchase program 
if necessary  we supplement this cash flow with borrowings under bank credit facilities to finance some capital expenditures and business acquisitions 
as we are a netherlands holding company  we conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries 
our cash flow is largely dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or otherwise distribute or advance funds to us 
we utilize the non gaap financial measure of free cash flow to evaluate our cash flows and results of operations 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations before the impact of the debt prepayment charge  less capital expenditures 
management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it represents the cash  in excess of capital expenditures  available to operate the business and fund non discretionary obligations 
the following table reconciles this non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap for the years ended december   and year ended december  free cash flow calculation unaudited  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities continuing operations add debt prepayment charge less capital expenditures free cash flow the increase in free cash flow in compared to and was due to an increase in net income adjusted for stock based compensation  as discussed below 
working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash flows the following table summarizes cash flows from continuing operations for the years ended december   and year ended december  continuing operations unaudited  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents the increase in cash flow from operating activities in compared to was primarily due to an increase in net income adjusted for stock based compensation  debt refinancing charges  and the increase in long term deferred revenue from the sale of analysis studies 
for compared to  the decrease in cash flows from operations was primarily due to the timing of payments related to accrued expenses  which contributed a larger net cash in flow in  and the impact of inventory  which required the use of cash in of million compared to a source of operating cash flow in of million  partially offset by an increase in net income from continuing operations 
cash flow used for investing activities increased million in over due to an increase in capital expenditures for offset by no acquisitions being made and a higher level of proceeds received from disposal of property  principally as a result of a settlement we reached with the british government after they exercised their right of eminent domain over one of our locations 
capital expenditures made in were for replacement of in place equipment and for additional equipment and instrumentation in growing markets 
for  investing activities declined to million for compared to million for this overall decline was due to the use of only million for acquisitions in compared to million in  and a million decline in capital expenditures 
significant capital expenditures in included million related to an upgrade of our company wide information system  and new facilities located in godley  texas and amsterdam to taling million 
purchase acquisitions in included the assets of goex for approximately million 
cash flow used by financing activities increased in compared to and to  as we continued to pay down debt in our financing activities reflected a net repayment of debt of million in and million in  while financing activities reflected net borrowings of million 
in  we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock  while in we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock and in we used million to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
this share repurchase program was approved by our shareholders at our annual meeting in may and repurchases began on october  under the program  we were authorized to repurchase up to of our outstanding common shares 
this authorization was extended by our shareholders at our annual meetings in may  a special meeting in october  and again in annual meetings in june and april at our april annual meeting of shareholders  we were authorized to continue our share repurchase program of up to of our outstanding common shares through october  in addition  we were authorized to cancel  of these repurchased shares  with a cost of million 
pursuant to this authorization  these shares were cancelled during the second quarter of during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of million  or an average price of per share 
as of february   we had authority to repurchase  additional shares 
the repurchase of shares in the open market is at the discretion of management 
we regard these treasury shares as a temporary investment which may be used to finance future acquisitions 
however  under the dutch commercial code dcc  we can only hold a maximum of of our outstanding shares in treasury 
therefore  it may be necessary to ca ncel some or all of these shares to remain in compliance with the dcc 
we believe this share repurchase program has been beneficial to our shareholders 
our share price has increased from per share when the program was announced in to per share on december   an increase of approximately 
in  we recorded a net cash inflow of million as a result of our discontinued operations which included million of proceeds from the sale of the specialized geophysical and seismic business and cash received from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit  partially offset by a use of operating cash flows 
credit facilities and available future liquidity we maintain a revolving credit facility the credit facility 
in march  we amended this facility extending the maturity date of the facility from june  to march  the amendment also provided for lower borrowing costs and commitment fees and modified certain debt covenant terms  as defined in the amended agreement 
in december  we amended this facility to increase the aggregate borrowing commitment under the original credit facility from million to million  extended the maturity dated from march  to december   and added an option to increase the commitment under the credit facility to million  if certain conditions are met 
the credit facility bears interest at variable rates from libor plus to a maximum of libor plus 
at december   the weighted average interest rate of amounts outstanding under the credit facility was 
the weighted average interest rate under this facility was for the year ended december  the credit facility matures in december and requires interest payments only until maturity 
these interest payments are based on the interest period selected 
our outstanding balance under the credit facility at december  was million and our available borrowing capacity under the credit facility at december  was million 
our available capacity is reduced by outstanding letters of credit and performance guarantees and bonds totaling million at december  related to certain projects in progress 
in july  we issued million in senior notes  million series a and million series b senior notes  that bear interest at an average fixed rate of and require annual principal payments of million for series a that began on july   continuing annually through july  and million for series b beginning on july  and continuing annually through july  in addition to semi annual interest payments 
on december   we repurchased all of our outstanding senior notes 
the senior notes were redeemed  in accordance with the note and guarantee agreement dated july   for face value plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make whole premium as prescribed in the senior note agreement 
such redemption was completed on december  and was funded utilizing a combination of excess cash and borrowings under the credit facility 
the total cash paid in connection with the repurchase was million of which million related t o the principal amount of the senior notes  million related to the accrued interest and million for a make whole premium which is included in debt prepayment charge in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the terms of the credit facility require us to meet certain financial covenants  including  but not limited to  certain operational and minimum equity and cash flow ratios 
we believe that we are in compliance with all such covenants contained in our credit agreement 
all of our material wholly owned subsidiaries are guarantors or co borrowers under the credit facility 
we have unsecured letters of credit  performance guarantees and bonds totaling million at december  in addition to our repayment commitments under our credit facilities  we have capital lease obligations related to the purchase of equipment  and non cancelable operating lease arrangements under which we lease property including land  buildings  office equipment and vehicles 
the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations under these arrangements total less than year years years more than years unaudited  in thousands contractual obligations long term debt capital leases operating leases pension and other a total contractual obligations a our dutch pension plan requires annual employer contributions 
amounts payable in the future will be based on future workforce factors which cannot be projected beyond one year 
we have no significant purchase commitments or similar obligations outstanding at december  we had tax net operating loss carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions of approximately million at december  if unused  those carry forwards which are subject to expiration may expire during the years through for  million of operating loss carry forwards which carried a full valuation allowance  expired unused 
although we cannot assure that these operating loss carry forwards will be utilized  we anticipate that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to allow us to fully utilize the carry forwards that are not subject to a valuation allowance as of december  we expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately million in in addition  we plan to continue to repurchase our common shares on the open market through our stock repurchase program 
our ability to continue this repurchase program depends on  among other things  market conditions and our ability to generate free cash flow 
our ability to maintain and increase our operating income and cash flows is largely dependent upon continued investing activities 
we believe our future cash flows from operating activities  supplemented by our borrowing capacity under existing facilities and our ability to issue additional equity should be sufficient to meet our contractual obligations  capital expenditures  working capital needs and to finance future acquisitions
