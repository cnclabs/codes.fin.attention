information in the following discussion for a yearly period means for the year ended december of the indicated year 
overview background we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule drugs for the treatment of central nervous system disorders 
we currently have four programs in clinical development and several additional programs in preclinical development and discovery stages 
our three proprietary phase ii clinical programs are acp for treatment induced dysfunctions in parkinson s disease  acp as an adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia  and acp for the treatment of schizophrenia 
we have retained worldwide commercialization rights for these programs 
we also have a neuropathic pain program in phase ii clinical trials in collaboration with allergan  inc all of the drug candidates in our product pipeline emanate from discoveries made using our proprietary drug discovery platform 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception due in large part to expenditures for our research and development activities 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our operating losses to increase for at least the next several years as we pursue the clinical development of our lead drug candidates and expand our discovery and development pipeline 
revenues we have not generated any revenues from product sales to date  and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next several years  if at all 
our revenues to date have been generated substantially from research and milestone payments under our collaboration agreements 
we have entered into 
table of contents three separate collaboration agreements with allergan and one with sepracor 
we have also entered into a development agreement with the stanley medical research institute smri  and smaller scale collaboration and license agreements with other parties 
as of december   we had received an aggregate of million in payments under these agreements  including research funding and related fees and upfront and milestone payments 
we expect our revenues for the next several years to consist primarily of payments under our current agreements and any additional collaborations  including upfront payments upon execution of new agreements  research funding throughout the research term of our agreements with these parties and milestone payments contingent upon achievement of agreed upon objectives 
pursuant to the terms of our january collaboration agreement with sepracor  we had received million in initial research funding as of december   and we are entitled to receive additional research funding through january in addition  in connection with this collaboration  sepracor has purchased an aggregate of million of our common stock in two million tranches 
in january  sepracor purchased the first million of our common stock at a percent premium to the day trailing average closing price 
we recorded the aggregate premium amount of million resulting from this initial stock purchase as deferred revenue 
in january  sepracor completed the second million purchase of our common stock at a percent premium to the day trailing average price at that time  resulting in a premium of million 
we are recognizing the premium from these stock purchases as revenue as the related research activities are performed over the research term 
pursuant to our collaboration with sepracor  if certain conditions are met  we are also eligible to receive license fees and milestone payments as well as royalties on product sales  if any 
pursuant to the terms of our march collaboration agreement with allergan  we had received an aggregate of million in payments as of december   consisting of upfront fees  and research funding and related fees 
this collaboration originally provided for a three year research term ending in late march  which was extended by the parties in february for two additional years through march we will receive additional research funding during this extended term 
we may also receive milestone payments and royalties on product sales  if any  under each of our three collaboration agreements with allergan 
pursuant to our development agreement with smri  we are entitled to receive up to million in funding to support the development of acp  of which million had been received as of december  each of our collaboration agreements is subject to early termination by the collaborator upon specified events  including if we breach the agreement or  in the case of one of our agreements with allergan  if we have a change in control 
upon the conclusion of the research term under each agreement  our collaborator may terminate the agreement by notice 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  fees paid to external service providers  laboratory supplies and costs for facilities and equipment 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on our most advanced clinical and preclinical programs 
we are responsible for all costs incurred in the development of acp for both schizophrenia and treatment induced dysfunctions in parkinson s disease and in the development of acp for schizophrenia  as well as the costs associated with our other internal programs 
we are not responsible for  nor have we incurred  development expenses  including costs related to clinical trials  in the programs that we are pursuing under our collaboration agreements  including our clinical program for neuropathic pain and our preclinical development program for glaucoma  each of which we are pursuing in collaboration with allergan 
we use our internal research and development resources  including our employees and discovery infrastructure  across several projects and many of our costs are not attributable to a specific project but are directed to broadly applicable research activities 
accordingly  we do not report our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
we use external service providers to manufacture our drug candidates to be 
table of contents used in clinical trials and for the majority of the services performed in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our drug candidates 
to the extent that costs associated with external service providers are not attributable to a specific project  they are included in other external costs 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  excluding stock based compensation expense 
years ended december  in thousands costs of external service providers acp acp other subtotal internal costs total research and development at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current research and development programs 
clinical development timelines  probability of success  and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on advancing the clinical development of acp and acp  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to each drug candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which drug candidates will be subject to future collaborative or licensing arrangements  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our drug candidates 
we expect our research and development expenses to be substantial and to increase as we continue the development of our clinical programs and expand our discovery and development pipeline 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our drug candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the accounting policies that we believe require application of management s most subjective judgments  often requiring the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our actual results may differ substantially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe that the following accounting policies require the application of significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
arrangements with multiple elements are accounted for in accordance with 
table of contents emerging issues task force issue no 
 or eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf our revenues are primarily related to our collaboration agreements  and such agreements may provide for various types of payments to us  including upfront payments  research funding and related fees during the term of the agreement  milestone payments based on the achievement of established development objectives  licensing fees  and royalties on future product sales 
upfront  non refundable payments under collaboration agreements are recorded as deferred revenue once received and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
non refundable payments for research funding are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the period as the related research activities are performed 
revenues from non refundable milestones are recognized when the earnings process is complete and the payment is reasonably assured 
non refundable milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the triggering event 
revenues from non refundable license fees are recognized upon receipt of the payment if the license has stand alone value  we do not have ongoing involvement or obligations  and the fair value of any undelivered items can be determined 
accrued expenses we are required to estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements 
examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development  manufacturing of clinical materials  and clinical trials 
we accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials or services provided  and the invoices received from our external service providers 
in the case of clinical trials  a portion of the estimated cost normally relates to the projected cost to treat a patient in our trials and we recognize this cost over the estimated term of the study based on the number of patients enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis  beginning with patient enrollment 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
however  we expect to expand the level of our clinical trials and related services in the future 
as a result  we anticipate that our estimated accruals for clinical services will be more material to our operations in future periods 
subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accrual  which could also materially affect our balance sheet and results of operations 
stock based compensation we account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  and provide pro forma disclosures of net income loss as if a fair value method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
stock compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of our underlying common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire such stock 
this compensation cost is amortized over the related vesting periods  generally four years  using an accelerated method 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
we are required to implement sfas r in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet fully determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements  however  we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our results of operations 

table of contents results of operations fluctuations in operating results our results of operations have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future 
we anticipate that our quarterly and annual results of operations will be impacted for the foreseeable future by several factors  including the timing and amount of payments received pursuant to our current and future collaborations  and the progress and timing of expenditures related to our discovery and development efforts 
due to these fluctuations  we believe that the period to period comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to million in revenues recognized under our collaboration agreement with sepracor  which commenced in january  million in revenues earned in pursuant to our agreement with smri  and increased revenues in from our collaboration agreements with allergan 
revenues from our collaboration agreements with allergan increased to million in from million primarily due to increased milestone payments earned during our march collaboration with allergan originally provided for a three year research term ending in late march  which was extended by the parties in february for two additional years through march while we will receive additional research funding during this extended term  we currently anticipate lower revenues from this collaboration during the extension term 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in primarily due to increased clinical development expenses associated with our proprietary phase ii programs and expansion of our research and development organization 
this increase in expenses in was due to million in increased fees paid to external service providers  and increased costs associated with our internal research and development organization  including million in increased salaries and related personnel costs   in increased facility and equipment costs  and  in increased laboratory supply and other costs 
external service costs totaled million in  or percent of our research and development expenses  compared to million in  or percent of our research and development expenses 
we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to pursue the clinical development of our lead drug candidates and expand our discovery and development pipeline 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of salaries and other costs for employees serving in executive  finance  business development  and business operations functions  as well as professional fees associated with legal and accounting services  increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to million in increased professional fees  and increased costs associated with expansion of our administrative organization  including  in increased salaries and related personnel costs  and  in increased facility and other administrative costs 
the increase in professional fees in was primarily due to costs associated with our sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts and  to a lesser degree  costs related to litigation 
we expect to incur lower expenses associated with our sarbanes oxley act compliance efforts during however  we anticipate that this reduction will be offset by increases in general and administrative expenses in future periods as we support the future growth of our business and incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company and costs related to litigation 

table of contents provision for loss from litigation we recorded a provision for loss from litigation of million during  which amount represented the aggregate amount of damages awarded pursuant to the jury verdict against us plus  awarded for attorneys fees and costs and accrued interest  net of proceeds that we may receive under our employment practices liability insurance policy 
we have filed a notice of appeal  but there can be no assurance that ultimately we will prevail in our efforts to overturn this award 
stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease resulted largely from a decrease in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation associated with employee stock options 
interest income interest income increased to million in from  in the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average levels of cash and investment securities and  to a lesser extent  increased yields on our investment portfolio 
interest expense interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to repayments under our loan agreements 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues revenues decreased to million in from million in primarily due to a decrease in collaborative research revenues following the completion of the research term of our collaboration agreement with amgen inc in late revenues from our collaboration agreements with allergan totaled million and million in and  respectively 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to million in increased fees paid to external service providers  and increased costs associated with our internal research and development activities  including million in increased salaries and related personnel costs   in increased laboratory supplies  and  in increased facility and equipment costs 
external service costs totaled million in  or percent of our research and development expenses  compared to million in  or percent of our research and development expenses 
the increase in external service costs in was primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with clinical development of acp and acp general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to million in increased professional services and insurance costs and  in increased personnel and related expenses associated with operating as a public company  beginning in june 
table of contents stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation expense totaled million in compared to million in the increase in stock based compensation expense resulted from an increase in the amortization of deferred stock based compensation associated with employee stock options and compensation expense from the valuation of options granted to consultants 
interest income interest income increased to  in from  in the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average levels of cash and investment securities resulting from the proceeds of our initial public offering  which closed in june interest expense interest expense decreased to  in from  in the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to repayments of  and decreased borrowings under  our loan agreements 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities  payments under our collaboration agreements  debt financings  and interest income 
as of december   we had received million in net proceeds from sales of our equity securities  including million in debt we had retired through the issuance of our common stock  million in payments from collaboration agreements  million in debt financing  and million in interest income 
at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  investment securities  and restricted cash compared to million at december  in addition  in january we received million in proceeds from the sale of the second tranche of our common stock to sepracor in connection with our collaboration agreement 
we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in investment securities consisting of high quality  marketable debt instruments of corporations  financial institutions  and government agencies 
we have adopted an investment policy and established guidelines relating to diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in  despite the higher net loss  was primarily due to an million accrued loss from litigation as well as increases in accrued expenses and deferred revenue  offset by an increase in prepaid expenses  receivables and other current assets 
the accrued loss from litigation represents an accrual for the aggregate damages  attorneys fees and costs awarded pursuant to the jury verdict against us plus accrued interest 
the increase in accrued expenses during was primarily due to the increase in activity with external service providers 
the increase in deferred revenue during was largely attributable to payments from our collaboration with sepracor and an advance payment related to our agreement with smri 
the increase in prepaid expenses  receivables and other current assets in was primarily due to the million in insurance proceeds which we may receive under our employment practices liability insurance policy in connection with our previously disclosed litigation 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in relative to was primarily due to an increase in our net loss  partially offset by increased non cash  stock based compensation expense  and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to increased activity with external service providers and employee related expenses 
net cash used in investing activities reflects purchases and maturities of investment securities and our purchases of property and equipment 
from inception through december   we had purchased million in property and equipment  the majority of which we have funded through equipment financing agreements and other debt facilities 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in compared to million in and million in the net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to million in net proceeds received from sales of our equity securities  including million received from the sale of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in our april private placement and million from the purchase of common stock by sepracor  which amount does not include the million premium received in connection with this stock purchase  partially offset by net repayments of our long term debt and the increase in restricted cash 
the restricted cash of million in represents cash on deposit as collateral for a letter of credit to back the bond we filed in the san diego superior court in connection with the appeal of the jury verdict in our civil litigation 
the net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to net proceeds of approximately million raised in our initial public offering  offset by net repayments of our long term debt 
the net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the sale of preferred stock  partially offset by net repayments of our long term debt 
we have entered into equipment financing agreements from time to time  which we have utilized to fund the majority of our property and equipment acquisitions 
the agreements contain interest rates ranging from to percent per annum 
at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under these agreements  which are secured by the related equipment 
we were in compliance with required financial covenants and conditions at december  the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations  including interest  at december  total less than year years years after years operating leases long term debt total we have also entered into agreements with contract research organizations and other external service providers for services in connection with the development of our drug candidates 
we were contractually obligated for up to approximately million of future services under these agreements as of december  the nature of the work being conducted under our agreements with contract research organizations is such that  in most cases  the services may be stopped with short notice 
in such event  we would not be liable for the full amount of the contract 
our actual contractual obligations may vary depending upon several factors  including the results of the underlying studies 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital since our inception 
although we believe our existing cash resources and the anticipated payments from our existing collaborators will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements through at least mid  we will require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations 
our future capital requirements will depend on  and could increase significantly as a result of  many factors  including progress in  and the costs of  our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development programs  the scope  prioritization and number of research and development programs  the ability of our collaborators and us to reach the milestones  and other events or developments  under our collaboration agreements  
table of contents the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production of drug candidates  the costs of establishing  or contracting for  sales and marketing capabilities if we obtain regulatory clearances to market our drug candidates  and the costs associated with litigation 
until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through strategic collaborations  private or public sales of our securities  debt financings  or by licensing all or a portion of our drug candidates or technology 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission providing for the issuance by us of up to million of our common stock from time to time in one or more transactions 
the shelf registration is intended to provide us with flexibility to take advantage of financing opportunities when and if deemed appropriate by our management 
we cannot be certain that funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts 
to date  we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in connection with our private placement in april  we issued warrants to purchase our  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the allocated fair value of the warrants at the issuance date of million has been included as permanent equity in our balance sheet 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas r 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r will be effective beginning with our first quarter of we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r and have not yet fully determined its impact on our consolidated financial statements  however  we anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest our excess cash in investment grade  interest bearing securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality marketable debt instruments of corporations  financial institutions  and government agencies with maturities of less than two years 
if a percent change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in sweden and denmark  which expose us to foreign exchange risk 
the functional currency of our subsidiary in sweden is the swedish kroner and the functional currency of our 
table of contents subsidiary in denmark is the danish kroner 
accordingly  all assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries are translated to us dollars based on the applicable exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
expense components are translated to us dollars at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the period 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency translation are included as a component of our stockholders equity 
other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in our results of operations and  to date  have not been significant 
we have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instrument
