these statements are based upon current plans  estimates and projections 
our actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors

table of contents executive overview our principal operating subsidiary  montpelier re  operates as a bermuda based provider of global property and casualty reinsurance and insurance products 
we operate in markets where we believe our underwriting expertise and financial strength represent a relative advantage 
our profitability in any given period is based upon our premium and investment revenues less net loss and loss adjustment expenses and operating expenses 
premiums are a function of the number and type of reinsurance and insurance contracts we write  as well as prevailing market prices 
renewal dates for reinsurance business tends to be concentrated at the beginning of quarters  and the timing of premium written varies by line of business 
most property catastrophe business is written in the january  april  june and july renewal periods  while the property specialty and other specialty lines are written throughout the year 
written premiums are generally lower during the fourth quarter of the year as compared to prior quarters 
the following are the main categories of gross premium written property specialty contracts in this category include risk excess of loss  property pro rata and direct insurance and facultative reinsurance business 
risk excess of loss reinsurance protects insurance companies on their primary insurance risks and facultative reinsurance transactions on a single risk basis 
coverage is usually triggered by a large loss sustained by an individual risk rather than by smaller losses which fall below the specified retention of the reinsurance contract 
we also write direct insurance and facultative reinsurance coverage on commercial property risks where we assume all or part of a risk under a single insurance contract 
we generally write such coverage on an excess of loss basis 
for we will attempt to reduce our catastrophe exposure on direct and facultative treaty contracts through changes in policy terms and conditions 
we also write property pro rata reinsurance contracts which are reinsurances of individual property risks written on a proportional basis rather than on an excess of loss basis 
property catastrophe these contracts are typically all risk in nature  providing protection against losses from earthquakes and hurricanes  as well as other natural and man made catastrophes such as floods  tornadoes  fires and storms 
the predominant exposures covered are losses stemming from property damage and business interruption coverage resulting from a covered peril 
certain risks  such as war  nuclear contamination and terrorism  are almost always excluded  partially or wholly  from our contracts 
property catastrophe reinsurance is written on an excess of loss basis  which provides coverage to primary insurance companies when aggregate claims and claims expenses from a single occurrence from a covered peril exceed a certain amount specified in a particular contract 
to a lesser extent  we have also writen retrocessional coverage contracts  which provide reinsurance protection to other reinsurers  also called retrocedants 
coverage generally provided catastrophe protection for the property portfolios of other reinsurers 
retrocessional contracts typically carry a higher degree of volatility than reinsurance contracts as they protect against concentrations of exposures written by retrocedants  which in turn may experience an aggregation of losses from a single catastrophic event 
commencing in blue ocean is intended to be the vehicle in which property catastrophe retrocessional business is written 
for additional discussion on gross premiums written see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other specialty reinsurance contracts of aviation liability  aviation war  marine  personal accident catastrophe  workers compensation  terrorism  other casualty and other reinsurance business are included in this category 
marine and aviation contracts are primarily written on a retrocessional excess of loss basis 
we have agreements with the overseas private investment corporation opic to underwrite stand alone terrorism insurance products  however  we have not yet written any business under these agreements 
we aim to control our risk by writing predominantly short tail lines of business 
aviation contracts are primarily written on a retrocessional excess of loss basis 
as for terrorism  a limited number of direct risks  reinsurance 
table of contents treaties and national pools are written as well 
commencing in we plan on exiting or significantly reducing our catastrophe exposed offshore marine class of business 
qualifying quota share qqs this category represents whole account quota share reinsurance to three lloyd s syndicates 
previously  we provided whole account quota share reinsurance  or qqs reinsurance  to three lloyd s syndicates for the and underwriting years 
we do not anticipate writing any additional qqs contracts at this time 
we have commuted the underwriting year contracts and expect to commute the underwriting contracts during the first or second quarter of income from our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of interest on fixed maturity investments net of investment expenses  dividends received on our equity investments  and to a lesser extent from net realized gains on the sale of investments 
a significant portion of our contracts provide short tail reinsurance coverage for damages resulting mainly from natural and man made catastrophes  which means that we could become liable for a significant amount of losses on short notice 
accordingly  we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains shorter term fixed maturity investments with a modest portfolio of equity investments 
our expenses consist primarily of loss and loss adjustment expenses  acquisition costs  general and administrative expenses and interest costs related to our debt 
loss and loss adjustment expenses are a function of the amount and type of reinsurance and insurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include a component for outstanding case reserves for claims which have been reported and a component for losses incurred but not reported 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process  together with the potential for unforeseen developments  may result in loss and loss adjustment expenses significantly greater or less than the reserve provided 
changes to our prior year loss reserves will impact our current underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant or reducing our results if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient 
as new information becomes known to us  any resulting adjustments will be reflected in income in the period in which they become known 
our ability to estimate loss and loss adjustment expenses accurately at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining our profitability 
since the classes of business we underwrite have large aggregate exposures to natural and man made catastrophes  we expect that our claims experience will predominantly be the result of relatively few events of significant severity 
the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in  and could have a material adverse effect on  our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to write new business 
acquisition costs consist principally of brokerage expenses and commissions which are driven by contract terms on the reinsurance and insurance contracts we write  and are normally a set percentage of premiums 
under certain contracts we may also pay profit commission to cedants which will vary depending on the loss experience on the contract 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of fixed expenses which include salaries and benefits  professional fees  office and risk management expenses  and variable expenses which include costs related to our performance unit plan  bonuses and stock option plan 
other than bonuses and performance units  expenses are primarily fixed in nature and do not vary with the amount of premiums written or losses incurred 
summary of critical accounting estimates loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
for most insurance and reinsurance companies  the most significant judgment made by management is the estimation of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
we maintain loss and loss adjustment expense reserves to cover our estimated liability for both reported and unreported claims 
we utilize a reserving methodology that calculates a point estimate for our ultimate losses  and we then develop a range around our point estimate 
the point estimate represents management s 
table of contents best estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses 
our internal actuaries review our reserving assumptions and our methodologies on a quarterly basis and our loss estimates are subject to an annual corroborative review by independent actuaries using generally accepted actuarial principles 
the extent of reliance on management judgment in the reserving process differs as to whether the business is insurance or reinsurance and as to whether the business is written on an excess of loss or on a pro rata basis 
loss reserve calculations for insurance business are not precise in that they deal with the inherent uncertainty of future contingent events 
estimating loss reserves requires us to make assumptions regarding future reporting and development patterns  frequency and severity trends  claims settlement practices  potential changes in the legal environment and other factors such as inflation 
these estimates and judgments are based on numerous factors  and may be revised as additional experience or other data becomes available and reviewed  as new or improved methodologies are developed or as current laws change 
reserving for reinsurance business introduces further uncertainties 
as predominantly a broker market reinsurer for both excess of loss and proportional contracts  we must rely on loss information reported to brokers by primary insurers who must estimate their own losses at the policy level  often based on incomplete and changing information 
the information we receive varies by cedant and may include paid losses  estimated case reserves  and an estimated provision for incurred but not reported losses ibnr reserves 
additionally  reserving practices and the quality of data reporting may vary among ceding companies which adds further uncertainty to the estimation of our ultimate losses 
there is a time lag inherent in reporting from the original claimant to the primary insurer to the broker and then to the reinsurer  especially in the case of excess of loss reinsurance contracts 
also  the combination of low claim frequency and high severity make the available data more volatile and less useful for predicting ultimate losses 
in the case of proportional contracts  we rely on an analysis of a contract s historical experience  industry information  and the professional judgment of underwriters in estimating reserves for these contracts 
in addition  if available  we also rely partially on ultimate loss ratio forecasts as reported by cedants  which are normally subject to a quarterly or six month lag 
as a result of the time lag described above  we must estimate ibnr reserves  which consist of a provision for additional development in excess of the case reserves reported by ceding companies  as well as a provision for claims which have occurred but which have not yet been reported to us by ceding companies 
because of the degree of reliance that we necessarily place on ceding companies for claims reporting  the associated time lag  the low frequency high severity nature of much of the business that we underwrite  and the varying reserving practices among ceding companies  our reserve estimates are highly dependent on management judgment and therefore uncertain 
during the loss settlement period  which may be years in duration  additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known  and current laws and case law may change 
estimating loss reserves for our small book of longer tail casualty reinsurance business  which can be either on an excess of loss or proportional basis  involves further uncertainties 
in addition to the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process described above  casualty business can be subject to much longer reporting lags than property business  and claims often take many years to settle 
during this period  additional factors and trends will be revealed and as these factors become apparent  reserves will be adjusted 
there is also the potential for the emergence of new classes of losses or types of losses within the casualty book 
any factors that extend the time until claims are settled add uncertainty to the reserving process 
at december   management has estimated gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to our casualty business of million 
since we rely on estimates of paid losses  case reserves  and ibnr provided by ceding companies in order to assist us in estimating our own loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  we maintain certain procedures in order to mitigate the risk that such information is incomplete or inaccurate 
at least monthly  management assesses the reporting activities of these companies on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria 
on a timely basis management takes appropriate follow up action as required  which may include requests for 
table of contents supplemental information or analysis and  in certain cases  ceding company audits conducted by our own staff or by third parties as appropriate 
in our short history  disputes with ceding companies have been rare and those which have not been resolved in negotiation have been resolved through arbitration in accordance with contractual provisions 
following hurricane katrina  disputes with ceding companies over policy terms and claims are expected to increase 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include both a component for outstanding case reserves for claims which have been reported and a component for ibnr reserves 
our case reserve estimates are initially set on the basis of loss reports received from third parties 
the majority of both our reinsurance and insurance business is sourced through brokers but a small proportion is sourced directly from the insured party or ceding company 
the reinsurance and insurance business which is sourced through brokers is subject to a potential time lag in the receipt of information which we factor into our reserving process as discussed above 
we are predominantly a reinsurance company specializing in short tail property reinsurance business  but we write a small proportion of longer tail casualty reinsurance business 
we also write a small book of direct insurance business  all of which is comprised of short tail property risks 
in general  claims relating to short tail property risks are reported more promptly by third parties than those relating to long tail risks  including the majority of casualty risks 
however  the timeliness of reporting can be affected by such factors as the nature of the event causing the loss  the location of the loss  and whether the losses are from policies in force with primary insurers or with reinsurers 
the claim count on the types of insurance and reinsurance that we write  which are low frequency and high severity in nature  is generally low 
the reporting delay for longer tail casualty business  which comprises a small proportion of our business  is traditionally longer than for our short tail lines 
because our casualty premiums written have been small relative to our property premiums written and because losses associated with such casualty premiums are substantially slower to develop than those associated with our property premiums  our volume of casualty claims has been significantly smaller than our volume of property claims to date 
due to these factors  we do not normally expect to experience significant claims processing back logs 
following a major catastrophic event  claims processing backlogs may occur 
at december   we did not have a significant back log in either our insurance or reinsurance claims processing 
ibnr reserves are estimated by management using various actuarial methods as well as a combination of our own historical loss experience  historical insurance industry loss experience  our underwriters experience  estimates of pricing adequacy trends  and management s professional judgment 
in the case of our reinsurance business  we also take into account ceding company reports on ibnr reserves in making our estimates 
due to our relatively short operating history  our loss experience is limited and reliable evidence of changes in trends of numbers of claims incurred  average settlement amounts  numbers of claims outstanding and average losses per claim will necessarily take many years to develop 
in addition  due to the nature of the business  this information is not routinely provided by the cedants for every contract 
because of these factors  management supplements our own claims experience with other information in setting reserves 
for catastrophic events  we consider aggregate industry loss reports and catastrophe model projections in addition to ceding company estimates and other factors as described above 
for other classes  we utilize industry loss ratio and development pattern information in conjunction with our own experience 
to the extent we rely on industry data to aid us in our reserve estimates there is a risk that the data may not match our risk profile or that the industry s reserving practices overall differ from our own and those of our cedants 
in addition  reserving can prove especially difficult should a significant loss event take place near the end of an accounting period  particularly if it involves a catastrophic event 
these factors further contribute to the degree of uncertainty in the reserving process 

table of contents following a major catastrophic event  such as hurricane katrina  the possibility of future litigation or legislative change that may impact interpretation of policy terms further increases the degree of uncertainty in the reserving process 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserving process  together with the potential for unforeseen developments  including changes in laws and the prevailing interpretation of policy terms  may result in loss and loss adjustment expenses significantly greater or less than the reserves provided 
changes to our prior year loss reserves will impact our current underwriting results by improving our results if the prior year reserves prove to be redundant or reducing our results if the prior year reserves prove to be insufficient 
for additional discussion on development of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to prior years see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we expect volatility in our results in periods that significant loss events occur because us gaap does not permit insurers or reinsurers to reserve for loss events until they have occurred and are expected to give rise to a claim 
as a result  we are not allowed to record contingency reserves to account for expected future losses 
we anticipate that claims arising from future events will require the establishment of substantial reserves from time to time 
management believes that the reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses are sufficient to cover losses that fall within the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers on the basis of the methodologies used to estimate those reserves 
however  there can be no assurance that actual losses will not exceed our total reserves 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserve estimates and the methodology of estimating such reserves are regularly reviewed and updated as new information becomes known to us 
any resulting adjustments are reflected in income in the period in which they become known 
management has determined that the best estimate for gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  was  million 
of this estimate million relates to our insurance business and  million relates to our reinsurance business 
management s best estimate of a range of likely outcomes around this estimate is between  million and  million 
the following table sets forth a breakdown between case reserves and ibnr by line of business at december  in millions gross loss and loss adjustment expense gross ibnr at gross case reserves at reserves at december  december  december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total premiums 
though we are principally a provider of reinsurance  we write both insurance and reinsurance contracts 
our insurance premium is all written on an excess of loss basis 
our assumed reinsurance premium is written on an excess of loss or on a pro rata basis 
reinsurance contracts are generally written prior to the time the underlying direct policies are written by cedants and accordingly they must estimate such premiums when purchasing reinsurance coverage 
for the majority of excess of loss contracts  including all insurance business  the deposit premium is defined in the contract wording 
the deposit premium is based on the ceding companies estimated premiums  and this estimate is the amount we record as written premium in the period the underlying risks incept 
in the majority of cases  these contracts are adjustable at the end of the contract period to reflect the changes in underlying risks during the contract period 
subsequent adjustments  based on reports by the ceding companies of actual premium  are recorded in the period they are determined  which are normally reported within six months to a one year subsequent to the expiration of the policy 
to date these adjustments have not been significant 
generally  on pro rata contracts and certain excess of loss contracts where the deposit premium is not specified in the contract  an estimate of written premium is recorded in the period in which the underlying 
table of contents risks incept 
the premium estimate is based on information provided by ceding companies 
at the inception of the contract the ceding company estimates how much premium they expect to write during the year 
as these are pro rata contracts  our gross written premium related to these contracts is a function of the amount of premium they estimate they will write 
when the actual premium is reported by the ceding company  which may be on a quarterly or six month lag  it may be significantly higher or lower than the estimate 
we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of these premium estimates based on the latest information available  which includes actual reported premium to date  the latest premium estimates as provided by cedants and brokers  historical experience  management s professional judgment  information obtained during the underwriting renewal process  as well as a continuing assessment of relevant economic conditions 
any adjustments to premium estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
adjustments to original premium estimates could be material and may significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined 
the net income impact in of premium adjustments with respect to premiums estimated to have been earned in was immaterial 
we also expect the net income impact for of premium adjustments with respect to premiums estimated to have been earned in to be immaterial 
where contract terms on excess of loss contracts require the reinstatement of coverage after a ceding company s loss  the mandatory reinstatement premiums are recorded as written and earned premiums when the loss event occurs 
we accrue reinstatement premiums based on case reserves reported by ceding companies and on management s best estimate of ibnr reserves as described above under loss and loss adjustment expense reserves when the ibnr reserves can be identified on an individual contract basis 
generally pro rata contracts do not contain provisions for the reinstatement of coverage 
management includes an assessment of the creditworthiness of cedants in the review process above  primarily based on market knowledge  the timeliness of cedants past payments and the status of current balances owing 
in addition  management may also review the financial statements of ceding companies 
based on this assessment  management believes that as at december  no provision for doubtful accounts is necessary 
for pro rata contracts where the expected risk period is months and for excess of loss contracts  other than risk attaching contracts or contracts where the deposit premium is not defined  premium income is generally earned ratably over the term of the reinsurance contract  usually months 
for all other contracts  comprising contracts written on a pro rata or risks attaching basis  premiums are generally earned over a month period which is the risk period of the underlying month policies 
the portion of the premium related to the unexpired portion of the policy at the end of any reporting period is reflected on the balance sheet in unearned premium 
reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance receivable and recoverable on paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses includes amounts due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  based on contracts in force 
the recognition of reinsurance recoverable requires two key judgments 
the first judgment involves our estimation of the amount of gross ibnr to be ceded to reinsurers 
ceded ibnr is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and consequently  its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross ibnr see loss and loss adjustment expense reserves above 
the second judgment relates to the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we will ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency  contractual dispute  or for other reasons 
at december  we recorded million in reinsurance receivable on paid claims and million in reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims 
based on a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors we have determined that a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable on paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is not considered necessary as at december  montpelier long term incentive plan ltip 
the compensation and nominating committee of the board of directors the committee approved a new long term incentive plan which became effective as of january  at the discretion of the committee  incentive awards  the value of which is based on the company s common shares  may be made to all eligible plan participants 

table of contents incentive awards that may be granted under the ltip consist of share appreciation rights sars  restricted share units rsus and performance shares performance shares 
each type of award gives a plan participant the right to receive a payment in cash  common shares or a combination thereof  including in the case of rsus dividend equivalents at the discretion of the committee 
all incentive awards granted by the committee under the ltip for the performance period were in the form of performance shares and no awards of sars or rsus were made to plan participants 
for the performance period  the primary performance target for all participants for a harvest ratio of performance shares is the achievement of an underwriting return on an internally generated risk based capital measure of over the period 
additionally  the performance of certain members of senior management is further measured by reference to the ratio of the actual return on equity to the return on risk based capital 
the total number of performance share awards outstanding under the ltip at december  was  or up to  common shares should the maximum harvest of of awards for the performance period apply 
due to the impact of the natural catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of on our results for the quarter and the year to date  we estimated the ltip liability and the ltip expense using a harvest ratio at december  and therefore there is no estimated payout related to this performance period 
we will reassess the harvest ratio used in the calculation of the ltip liability at the end of each quarter 
performance unit plan pup 
the pup was formerly the company s primary executive long term incentive scheme  until it was exhausted at december  pursuant to the terms of the pup  at the discretion of the committee  performance units were granted to executive officers and certain other key employees 
performance units entitle the recipient to receive  without payment to the company  all  double  or a part of the value of the units granted  depending on the achievement of specific financial or operating goals 
performance units vest at the end of a three year performance cycle  and are payable in cash  common shares or a combination thereof at the discretion of the committee 
we accrue the projected value of the ltip and pup units and expense the value in the income statement over the course of each three year performance period 
the accrual is based on the number of units granted  the share price at the end of the respective fiscal period end  plus an adjustment for any dividends paid out during the performance period  and an estimate of an ultimate harvest ratio  unless otherwise adjusted as discussed below 
at the end of the sixth quarter  and every subsequent quarter  we reassess the projected results for each three year performance period and adjust the accrued ltip and pup liability as necessary 
we recalculate the liability under the ltip and pup as our financial results evolve and the share price changes  and reflect such adjustments in income in the period in which they are determined 
this may result in an adjustment to the harvest ratio used in the liability calculation which may increase or decrease the amount of liability and expense recorded during the period 
for the cycle  the actual harvest ratio as determined by the compensating and nominating committee was 
on february   we paid out the pup accrual of million 
for the and cycles  the performance target for a harvest ratio is the achievement of an overall combined ratio of over the period or the achievement of an annual total return to shareholders of as measured over the period 
taking into account our results to date as well as the estimated overall combined ratio for the remainder of this performance period  we have adjusted the estimated harvest ratio of and  respectively  at december  to at december  due to the impact of the catastrophes 
outlook and trends the year turned out to be the most costly year ever for catastrophe losses to the insurance and reinsurance industry with aggregate loss estimates from hurricanes katrina  rita  and wilma  the european floods and hurricane dennis estimated to be between and billion 
the large loss events of and have had a significant impact on the market 
for reinsurers  it highlighted the significant amount of modeling risk and non modeled risk inherent in catastrophe exposed property products 
the modeling companies are responding by updating their models for increased frequency and severity of major events 
the 
table of contents rating agencies have different approaches  but some have reacted to the losses sustained by almost all reinsurers  which are above their expectations  by increasing capital adequacy requirements in respect of catastrophe exposures 
we expect that the updated vendor models due out in the spring of will drive up direct insurance companies modeled catastrophe pml s  and consequently  their catastrophe excess of loss limit demands 
at the same time  we expect that pml s for reinsurers who have not taken action by upgrading their models will also increase substantially  which may cause them to cut back on exposures or purchase additional protections at higher prices 
we believe these factors will lead to a capacity crunch for peak property business zones which will fuel the movement of prices upwards for coverage of those zones 
we believe that the retrocessional market is currently ahead of the direct insurance and catastrophe excess of loss markets in implementing rate increases 
these prices increased dramatically since the hurricanes occurred during the fall of in addition  we believe the industry loss warranty and catastrophe bond markets have become much more influential in the provision of protection to reinsurers and they now also command the dominant share of available capacity 
we anticipate that these markets will continue to see strengthening in pricing as the year goes on 
outside of the us peak property business zones discussed above and for other classes of business unexposed to peak zone peril limits we believe that there is a surplus of capacity which will restrain rate increases 
in addition  in some casualty classes we forsee rate reductions as reinsurers seek to diversify their portfolios 
currently we believe that it is only a matter of time before the pricing in the catastrophe excess of loss market increases in line with the retrocessional market 
we believe in the merits of our specialist property focus and have adapted to this new environment accordingly by way of the following we are structuring our gross portfolio within tighter constraints on aggregate exposures in most peak zones relative to our capital base 
we have done this in part by declining inadequately priced business in targeted segments  but also through changes in terms and conditions 
as an example  we are attempting to channel catastrophe peril coverage previously included in non catastrophe excess of loss property classes into the catastrophe excess of loss market  where in our view the exposure is more appropriately priced  we have adjusted our internal models for increased severity and frequency in advance of the changes in commercial models  we have purchased more retrocession protection and initiated our first catastrophe bond transaction  and we sponsored the launch of blue ocean re holdings ltd  to enable us to write property catastrophe retrocessional business on an unrated but fully collateralized basis 
this expands our policy of generating fee income through the provision of underwriting services to third party capital in one of the most capital intensive segments of the market 
all of these actions will alter our loss profile going forward 
compared to prior years  we expect that our results of operations will be less sensitive to low frequency large loss events  leading to a narrower range of likely outcomes from extreme events  but our results may be more sensitive to medium sized attritional events 
results of operations years ended december   and the decrease in net income of million for the year ended december  year compared to was principally driven by net losses incurred related to the us hurricanes  the effects of which far 
table of contents exceeded the hurricanes 
the overall net loss for the year ended december  was million 
the main factors driving this decrease were hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  which resulted in  million of net losses incurred at december  compared to net losses incurred related to the hurricanes for the year ended december  of million  an increase in outwards reinstatement premiums as a result of the hurricanes  and a reduction in net premiums written and earned from the purchase of additional retrocessional protection  particularly during the fourth quarter of these factors were partially offset by the following an increase in reinstatement premium written as a result of the hurricanes  a decrease in incentive compensation and profit commission expenses as a result of the hurricanes  an increase in net investment income as a result of our higher portfolio balance  and an increase in realized gains  principally due to gains on the sale of the remainder of our aspen holdings 
the decrease in net income for the year ended december  year compared to was principally driven by losses incurred related to the four major us hurricanes and two japanese typhoons which occurred during the third quarter of there were no loss events of a comparable magnitude in the same period in as at december  we estimated the overall negative impact on net income related to these catastrophes to be approximately million  which was as a result of the increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses and related increase in reinstatement premium ceded  partially offset by reinstatement premium written and a reduction in profit commission and incentive compensation expenses 
the following table summarizes our consolidated financial results for the years indicated in millions years ended december  net premiums earned net investment income net realized gains on investments net foreign exchange gains losses other income loss and loss adjustment expenses acquisition costs general and administrative expenses financing expense income tax expense net income loss basic earnings loss per common share diluted earnings loss per common share the following table summarizes our book values per common share as at the periods indicated as at december  book value per share fully converted book value per share 
table of contents based on total shareholders equity divided by basic shares outstanding 
fully converted book value per share is a non gaap measure  based on total shareholders equity divided by common shares outstanding of  at december  warrants outstanding at december  are not included as the exercise price of per common share is greater than book value per share 
at december  and  fully converted book value per share is based on total shareholders equity plus the assumed proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and warrants of million and million  respectively  divided by the sum of shares  options and outstanding warrants assuming their exercise of  for and  for we believe that fully converted book value per share more accurately reflects the value attributable to a common share 
we ended with a fully converted book value per share as defined above of  a decrease of from december  this decrease of mainly resulted from the net effect of the factors described above as well as the payment of a special dividend of per common share and warrant paid during the first quarter of and the payment of quarterly dividends of per common share and warrant for each of the first three quarters of and for the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by the issuance of  common shares on september  at per share 
we experienced a total return on our investment portfolio including net unrealized gains losses  foreign exchange gains losses on investments and the foreign exchange effect of insurance balances for the years ended december   and of approximately  and  respectively 
the change in fully converted book value per share adjusted for dividends  which is a non gaap measure was or for the year ended december  it is the internal rate of return of the change in fully converted book value per share from at december  to at december   giving effect to the dividend of for the first three quarters of  for the fourth quarter of and the special dividend of per common share and warrant declared during the year ended december  for these purposes fully converted book value per share assumes that the warrants are not exercised if the book value per share is less than the strike price 
the company believes that this measure most accurately reflects the return made by its shareholders as it takes into account the effect of all dilutive securities and the effect of dividends 
the company believes that fully converted book value per share and the change in fully converted book value per share adjusted for dividends are measurements which are important to investors and other interested parties who benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison with other companies within the industry 
however  these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies either outside or inside of the insurance industry 
these measures may be incorporated into the formulae applied by our compensation and nominating committee when determining the harvest ratio under our performance unit plan and our long term incentive plan 
gross premiums written details of gross premiums written by line of business are provided below in millions years ended december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total reinstatement premiums total excluding reinstatement premium 
table of contents during  we refined the classification of gross premiums written for certain pro rata contracts between the property specialty line and the property catastrophe and other specialty lines 
there was no effect on total gross premiums written 
for million related to the hurricanes and the remainder to the catastrophes 
for the year ended december   excluding the effects of reinstatement premiums  gross premiums written were higher in by million  or by as compared to the main driver of this increase was a strong us windstorm renewal season in the second quarter of the largest growth in premium was seen in our property specialty business with more pro rata business representing much of the increase 
the property catastrophe and other specialty categories also saw slight growth from the prior year  which was driven by loss impacted renewals mainly for florida programs at higher prices and a small number of new contracts with relatively high premiums 
in our mix of business has also changed modestly as compared to the prior year 
while our focus is still predominately short tail excess of loss business  we have written an increased amount of property pro rata business 
additionally  there has been an increase in our writings of casualty business during for the years ended december  and  casualty business represented approximately and of our gross premiums written  respectively 
excluding reinstatement premium  casualty business written increased by during as compared to casualty business is included in the other specialty category and includes medical malpractice  specialized errors and omissions business  uk employer s liability and public liability and catastrophe and or clash layers for general liability and retrocessional accounts  predominantly on an excess of loss basis 
we do not expect to write uk employers liability business in we expect casualty business to account for a lower percentage of gross written premium in mainly due to the cancellation of some of our contracts with aspen affiliates as discussed below 
as expected  we have not written qqs business since the qqs gross premiums written in and related to adjustments in estimates made to the and underwriting years mainly as a result of the movement in foreign exchange rates 
as expected  during we commuted all of the underwriting year qqs contracts and expect to commute all of the underwriting year contracts during the first or second quarter of during the second quarter of we participated in the founding of a new reinsurance vehicle  rockridge  which was established to invest its assets in a fixed income arbitrage strategy and assume high layer  short tail risks principally from montpelier 
this relationship provides us with the capacity to increase gross lines in specific programs where we see favorable underwriting opportunities 
we then cede this incremental business to rockridge and earn fees for the services we provide in underwriting the original business 
during the year ended december   we wrote million of incremental premium which was ceded to rockridge 
on december   the company invested in blue ocean re holdings ltd  the holding company that owns of blue ocean reinsurance ltd 
blue ocean re 
blue ocean re is a bermuda licensed reinsurer formed to write property catastrophe retrocessional protection 
montpelier agency ltd  a subsidiary of montpelier re holdings ltd  provides blue ocean re with underwriting  risk management  claims management  ceded retrocession agreement management  actuarial and accounting services and receives fees for such services 
as at december   the company beneficially owned  shares  or of blue ocean re holdings outstanding common shares and of the preferred shares 
under fin r  blue ocean re holdings ltd 
is consolidated into the company s financial statements and the of blue ocean s earnings and shareholders equity held by third parties is recorded in the consolidated financial statements as minority interest 
for the year ended december   excluding the effects of reinstatement premiums  gross premiums written were higher in by million  or less than as compared to as expected  our mix of business changed in we did not renew the qqs programs in and increased the level of other specialty business  consisting mainly of increases in casualty business and other miscellaneous classes of business 
consistent with  for the three syndicates we did reinsure in and  we negotiated 
table of contents substantial other reinsurance contracts for to partially replace the reduction in qqs premium in and the non renewed qqs premium income in gross premiums written related to the property specialty category increased in only marginally compared to the same period in mainly as a result of an increase in proportional business 
this increase was offset somewhat by the decreases in premium levels on direct and facultative business 
the property catastrophe category showed a slight increase in gross premiums written during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in mainly due to an increase in reinstatement premiums written as a result of the catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of offsetting this increase was a decrease due to the reduction in premium rate levels as discussed above 
the other specialty category strengthened in as compared to  partly due to increased market penetration resulting mainly from our ability to capitalize on market opportunities and  we believe  due to the developing reputation of our underwriting and risk management skills 
this category has also increased due to increases in the level of our casualty business 
we wrote a larger amount of casualty reinsurance in as compared to due to improving terms and conditions of casualty reinsurance contracts 
for the years ended december  and  casualty accounted for approximately and of gross premiums written  respectively 
in light of the changes we have made to our risk profile as set forth above  we expect that our gross premiums written for will be lower as compared to in addition to these changes  there were some one off factors which will also impact gross premiums written in as follows our agreement with aspen affiliates dating from whereby aspen agreed to cede million per year of gross premiums written to us for three years expired at the end of  and we did not renew a substantial portion of continental european business due to insufficient pricing and terms 
reinsurance premiums ceded years ended december  in millions reinsurance premiums ceded reinstatement premiums total excluding reinstatement premium for the years ended december  and  we purchased reinsurance protecting our direct and assumed reinsurance portfolio against large risk losses on our direct and facultative book and certain catastrophes on our overall property writings 
in addition  in we also purchased additional catastrophe and sabotage and terrorism retrocessional protection and specific retrocessional coverage on certain contracts during we also ceded property catastrophe reinsurance to rockridge as discussed above in the amount of approximately million during the year ended december  during we purchased industry loss warranty ilws reinsurance protection and quota share protection on our property catastrophe excess of loss book 
during the fourth quarter of reinsurance premiums ceded increased by approximately million which was due to additional reinstatement premium related to wilma and the purchase of additional ilws and quota share reinsurance to protect the fourth quarter of and for the year 
the impact on net earned premium of these purchases was approximately million  with the remaining million relating to pre purchases for the year 
these reinsurance purchases were principally designed to reduce our net exposure to large catastrophes 
in  we may purchase more large event protection coverage  including ilws  as well as additional quota share protection against our property business and additional specific protection for our direct and facultative business 
reinsurance premiums ceded for increased from primarily because we purchased additional protection against our catastrophe book as compared to the prior year 
in addition  in we also purchased 
table of contents protection for our casualty book and recorded reinstatement reinsurance premiums ceded of million related to the catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of there was also a slight increase during in the amount of inuring reinsurance recorded as part of our reinsurance arrangements with certain ceding companies 
for both the and years we have purchased reinsurance protecting ourselves against large risk losses on our direct and facultative book and small to medium size catastrophes on our overall property writings 
in addition to the reinsurance protection described above  effective december  the company purchased fully collateralized coverage for losses sustained from qualifying hurricane and earthquake loss events 
the company acquired this protection from champlain limited  a cayman islands special purpose vehicle  which financed this coverage through the issuance of million in catastrophe bonds to investors under two separate bond tranches each of which matures on january  the first million tranche covers large earthquakes affecting japan and or the us the remaining million coverage provides second event coverage for a us hurricane or earthquake 
both tranches respond to parametric triggers  whereby payment amounts are determined on the basis of modeled losses incurred by a notional portfolio rather than by actual losses incurred by the company 
for this reason  this cover is accounted for as a weather derivative  rather than a reinsurance transaction 
net premiums earned years ended december  in millions net premiums earned net premiums earned increased for the year ended december  as compared to  mainly due to net earned reinstatement premium related to the hurricanes of million compared to net earned reinstatement premium of million for the year ended december  related to the catastrophes 
net written and earned premiums are expected to decrease in due to a reduction in gross premiums written discussed above and an increased level of reinsurance premiums ceded 
this includes  among others  the large purchases that took place in the fourth quarter of as described above 
net premiums earned increased for the years ended december  and mainly due to the increase in gross premiums written for the majority of our lines of business in the current and prior year 
net premiums earned have also increased due to the acceleration of earned premiums related to certain policies affected by the catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of we also earned a portion of the reinstatement premiums written and ceded related to the third quarter catastrophes 
offsetting these increases is a decrease in net earned premium as a result of the earning of the additional reinsurance purchased during the year 
net premiums earned increased by approximately million as result of the effect of the third quarter catastrophes 
loss and loss adjustment expenses the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are often measured by reference to its loss ratio and expense ratio 
the loss ratio is calculated by dividing loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred including estimates for incurred but not reported losses by net premiums earned 
the expense ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition costs combined with general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 

table of contents for comparative purposes  our combined ratio and components thereof are set out below for the years indicated years ended december  loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio the nature of our business means that loss ratios can vary widely from period to period depending on the occurrence and severity of natural and man made catastrophes 
during the year ended december   we incurred estimated gross and net losses of  million and  million  respectively  from hurricanes katrina  rita  wilma and dennis in the u 
s and the european floods 
the severity of the catastrophe losses contributed significantly more to the loss ratio than in previous years 
the loss ratio was impacted by the four florida hurricanes and two japanese typhoons while was a very light year in terms of catastrophe losses 
net loss and loss adjustment expenses were  million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
reinsurance recoveries of million  million and million were netted against loss and loss adjustment expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of the reinsurance recoveries for and related to the us hurricanes which occurred during those two years 
reinsurance recoveries for the years ended december  related to qqs only 
based on additional information received from the syndicates  we reduced our estimated recovery ratio on reinsurance purchased by the qqs syndicates which resulted in the negative reinsurance recovery amount for the year ended december  we paid net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in paid losses during as compared to related to payments made for the hurricane losses as discussed above 
in addition  excluding the catastrophes  net paid losses have increased each year as our book of business has matured and we make claim payments related to multiple underwriting years 
we expect that our paid losses will be higher than average during the first six months of as we continue to pay claims related to the and catastrophes 
at december   approximately of our gross reserves related to the five catastrophes mentioned above 
the following are our net loss ratios by line of business for the periods indicated years ended december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share overall ratio the overall gross loss ratio for the year ended december  was the overall gross loss ratio for the year ended december  was the overall gross loss ratio for the year ended december  was the property catastrophe  property specialty  and other specialty groups of business were all heavily impacted by the aforementioned catastrophes 
the property specialty loss ratio for the year ended december  was 
all of the property specialty lines of business suffered large losses from hurricane katrina 
hurricane rita also contributed significant losses to the property risk excess of loss book of business  and hurricane wilma significantly impacted the property risk and property pro rata lines 
the three hurricanes resulted in approximately million of net losses for the property specialty category in the property catastrophe net loss ratio for the year ended december  was significantly higher 
table of contents than the corresponding periods in due to the nature of the natural catastrophes compared with the storms 
the extreme size of the industry loss for katrina resulted in much more loss to our retrocessional book of business than from any of the storms 
we also suffered losses to some of the higher layers in our property catastrophe book of business that were not affected by any of the hurricanes 
in the same period in  we incurred losses from hurricanes fabian and isabel as well as the wildfires which occurred in california 
the other specialty loss ratio for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by katrina and rita losses to our marine book of business 
marine losses from the two hurricanes contributed points to the net loss ratio for the year for the other specialty category 
in addition to the hurricane losses impacting the marine book in the last two years  there is also a higher percentage of casualty business in the other specialty group in and compared with these classes have been reserved at higher loss ratios due to the longer tail nature of the casualty business 
the qualifying quota share loss ratio for the year ended december  is high as a result of a negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations  along with the low earned premium volume for the year 
the underwriting year qqs contracts were commuted during the second quarter of the qualifying quota share loss ratio for the year ended december  was lower than the same period in as a result of the qqs syndicates lowering their ultimate loss ratio projections for both the and the underwriting years 
the following tables set forth a reconciliation of our gross and net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by line of business for the year ended december  in millions gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves estimated ultimate change in losses gross prior years for the gross reserves at estimates paid losses year at reserves at december  during during december  december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves estimated ultimate change in losses net prior years for the net reserves at estimates paid losses year at reserves at december  during during december  december  property specialty property catastrophe other specialty qualifying quota share total the and years include approximately million and million  respectively  of favorable development of net losses from prior years 
favorable prior year development benefited the net loss ratio for the years ended december  and by approximately and  respectively 

table of contents the favorable development during the year ended december  of losses incurred during prior accident years primarily resulted from the following in the property specialty category  our net estimated ultimate losses for prior years decreased by million during the year ended december  our gross estimated ultimate losses increased slightly  but this was more than offset on a net basis by an increase in the ceded losses attributable to the hurricanes 
we have continued to see lower than expected loss development on the accident year 
as these years develop  we place more weight in the reserving process on the actual loss experience compared with the initial loss ratio expectation 
the low level of losses for and for excluding the hurricanes coupled with the increasing weight on the actual experience have led to the reduction in the ultimate loss projection of million during property catastrophe net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as at december  increased by million during the year ended december  the increase in ultimate losses for the year was due mostly to increases in the estimates for the hurricanes and typhoon songda 
the increase in the gross loss reserves was offset somewhat by an increase in the ceded losses attributable to the hurricanes 
excluding the hurricanes and songda  there was little movement in the property cat loss reserves for prior years 
we continued to see low claim frequency in the other specialty classes of business during as this business has matured  we have given more weight to the actual loss experience compared to the initial expected loss ratios in our reserving process 
this has resulted in reduced projections for prior accident years and lower selected net loss ratios 
the low level of loss development  combined with the increasing weight placed on our actual experience in selecting a loss ratio resulted in a reduction in ultimate losses of million for prior accident years for the year ended december  due to the potential variability in ultimate premiums and the limited availability of underlying loss information with the qqs business  our actuaries selected an expected loss ratio based on a review of the information supplied by cedants and applied it to projected premiums 
for the year ended december   the projected ultimate losses have increased  due mostly to foreign currency fluctuations 
much of the negative impact from the currency fluctuations affected the contracts 
as expected  we commuted all three of the qqs contracts during the second quarter of taking into account the effect of reinsurance purchased by the qqs syndicates with respect to the contracts in which we participate  our net projected ultimate losses increased by million for the year ended december  we expect to commute the qqs contracts during the first half of other than the matters described above  we did not make any significant changes in the assumptions or methodology used in our reserving process during the year ended december  at december   we estimated our gross and net reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses using the methodology as outlined in our summary of critical accounting estimates earlier in this section 
management has determined that the best estimate for gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december   and was  million  million and million  respectively 
management has determined that the best estimate for net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december   and was  million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents the following are management s best estimates of a range of likely outcomes around their best estimate of gross and net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by line of business in millions gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  low end of high end of the range selected the range property specialty property catastrophe qualifying quota share other specialty total net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves at december  low end of high end of the range selected the range property specialty property catastrophe qualifying quota share other specialty total net foreign exchange gains losses net foreign exchange gains losses resulted from the effect of the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities combined with realized losses resulting from the receipt of premium installments and payment of claims in foreign currencies 
the foreign exchange gains losses during the years ended december   and are primarily due to the weakening strengthening of the us dollar resulting in losses on translation arising out of receipts of non us dollar premium installments 
our premiums receivable and liabilities for losses incurred in currencies other than the us dollar are exposed to the risk of changes in value resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and may affect our financial results in the future 
the foreign exchange loss for the year ended december  was as a result of an increase in foreign currency cash and fixed maturity investments held 
underwriting expenses years ended december  in millions acquisition costs including profit commission general and administrative expenses expense ratio including profit commission expense ratio excluding profit commission acquisition costs are generally driven by contract terms and are normally a set percentage of premiums 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of fixed expenses  which include salaries and benefits  share options  office and risk management expenses  and variable expenses  which include costs related to our performance unit plan  long term incentive plan and bonuses 
the increase in acquisition costs during the year ended december  as compared to is consistent with the increase in gross premiums written as discussed above 

table of contents profit commission expensed was million  million and million for years ended december   and  respectively 
over each of the past three years profit commission has declined as compared to the prior year  mainly due to the increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses related to the and hurricanes 
profit commission will fluctuate as our estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves fluctuates 
general and administrative expenses for the years indicated consisted of the following in millions years ended december  fixed expenses  excluding share options current and deferred incentive compensation fair value of share options expense total general and administrative expenses fixed expenses  excluding stock options  are slightly higher in as compared to  mainly as a result of an increase in office expenses  consistent with the increase in staff numbers which occurred later in performance unit plan pup expense and long term incentive plan ltip expense included in current and deferred incentive compensation were reversed during the year ended december  as a result of the effect that the catastrophes had on our results 
we have used an estimated harvest ratio of for the  and performance periods 
in addition  current incentive compensation expense was lower for the year ended december  as compared to due to the reasons described above 
all outstanding share options were converted into restricted and unrestricted common voting shares during the first quarter of with unvested options expensed at the time of conversion which is the reason for the decline in this expense as compared to participating directors in the directors share plan received three quarterly allotments of share units for which we incurred an expense of million during the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses in from was partially a result of an increase in fixed expenses for professional fees and employment costs  consistent with the increase in staff numbers in in addition  there was an increase in the accrual for current and deferred incentive compensation expense  but not as much as originally anticipated  as our net income decreased due to the catastrophes which occurred during the third quarter of for the year ended december   the performance unit plan pup expense included in current and deferred incentive compensation was higher than the same period in as a result of a combination of factors 
the factors that affect the calculation of the pup expense in consist of a decrease in the harvest ratio used in calculating the expense for the performance period from at december  to at december  this reduction resulted mainly from the effect of the third quarter of catastrophes  the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in our share price which includes an adjustment for any dividends paid out during the performance period from to for the performance cycle  the expense increased in due to the increase in the harvest ratio from at the end of to at december   combined with the increase in our share price which includes an adjustment for any dividends paid out during the performance period  from to the year also includes an additional accrual for the performance period 
the overall effect was a net increase in the pup expense as compared to on february  we paid out the pup accrual of approximately million 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expense ratio will be higher in than in due to the expected increase in costs resulting from the move to our new premises during  the upgrading of our it infrastructure and an increase in current and deferred incentive compensation combined with the expected 
table of contents decrease in net premiums earned as discussed above 
the expense for current and deferred incentive compensation will depend on the financial results achieved 
net investment income years ended december  in millions net investment income accretion of premium on bonds investment management  accounting and custodian fees the majority of investment management fees incurred related to white mountains advisors llc  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of white mountains insurance group  one of our major shareholders and were million  million and million  respectively for the years ended december   and the investment management fees are higher for as compared to due to the greater proportion of equities under management  which have higher investment management fees and also due to the greater average volume of funds under management 
the investment management and custodian fees are lower for as compared to even though the asset base increased because the investment management fee structure was revised during the first quarter of  resulting in a lower expense for the portfolio mix 
the fees will vary as our mix of investments changes 
management believes that the fees charged were consistent with those that would have been charged by an unrelated party 
because we provide short tail insurance and reinsurance coverage for losses resulting mainly from natural and man made catastrophes  we could become liable to pay substantial claims on short notice 
accordingly  we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains shorter term fixed maturity investments  such as us government securities  us government sponsored enterprises securities  corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
based on the weighted average monthly investments held  and including net unrealized gains losses  and foreign exchange gains losses on investments and the foreign exchange effect of insurance balances for the years ended december   and  respectively  the total investment returns were as follows years ended december  total investment return weighted average investment portfolio balance in millions in  our investment return decreased compared with the same period in this is principally a result of the overall market movement in bond prices during each respective period 
in addition  the level of the investment portfolio and related investment income was affected by the special dividend we declared on february  of million 
the size of the investment portfolio and related investment income will be affected by the hurricanes which occurred during as we have paid out a substantial amount of claims during and will be paying out substantially more claims over the next twelve months to an extent offset by equity and subordinated debt capital we have raised 
net paid claims were million in as compared to million in 
table of contents in compared to  as expected  our investment income increased as a result of our larger investment portfolio 
net paid claims were million in as compared to million in years ended december  in millions proceeds from sales of available for sale securities gross realized losses other than temporary impairment fixed maturities gross realized losses other than temporary impairment equity investments aggregate fair value of securities in unrealized loss position aggregate fair value of securities in unrealized loss position months we believe that the gross unrealized losses relating to our fixed maturity investments at december  and of million and million  respectively  resulted primarily from increases in market interest rates from the dates that certain investments within that portfolio were acquired as opposed to fundamental changes in the credit quality of the issuers of such securities 
therefore  these decreases in value are viewed as being temporary because we have the intent and ability to retain such investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we also believe that the gross unrealized losses relating to our equity portfolio of million and million at december  and  respectively  are temporary based on an analysis of various factors including the time period during which the individual investment has been in an unrealized loss position and the significance of the decline 
because we provide short tail insurance and reinsurance coverage for losses resulting mainly from natural and man made catastrophes  we could become liable to pay substantial claims on short notice 
accordingly  we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity  which means that the large majority of our investment portfolio contains shorter term fixed maturity investments  such as us government and agency bonds  us government sponsored enterprises  corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
due to higher short term fixed income yields  our capital raise and an increased level of insurance float  we project a greater proportion of our returns will be generated from investment income in the increased insurance float is attributable to both a large catastrophe loss reserves which we will pay out over the next couple of years  and to a lesser extent b the build up of attritional loss reserves over the years

both tranches respond to parametric triggers  whereby payment amounts are determined on the basis of modeled losses incurred by a notional portfolio rather than by actual losses incurred by the company 
for this reason  this cover is accounted for as a weather derivative  rather than a reinsurance transaction 
fees paid in relation to the catastrophe bond are calculated at plus basis points per annum on the first tranche plus plus basis points on the second tranche 
fees are payable quarterly  the first payment being due on april  however  in the event that this cover is triggered the amount of fees that we will have to pay will be significantly lower than what is reflected above

on august   montpelier re renewed tranche a of its syndicated collateralized  day facility in the amount of million  in order to fulfill the requirements of lloyd s for open years of account 
this facility was originally arranged in on august   montpelier re amended and restated tranche b of the syndicated collateralized facility from a million three year facility to a million five year facility with a revised expiry date of august on november   montpelier re entered into a new letter of credit reimbursement and pledge agreement with bank of america  na and a syndicate of commercial banks for the provision of a letter of 
table of contents credit facility in favor of us ceding companies 
the agreement is a one year secured facility that allows montpelier re to request the issuance of up to billion in letters of credit 
all of the company s letter of credit facilities contain covenants that limit the company s and montpelier re s ability  among other things  to grant liens on their assets  sell assets  merge or consolidate 
the letter of credit facility agreement for the syndicated collateralized facility also requires the company to maintain debt leverage of no greater than and montpelier re to maintain an am best financial strength rating of no less than b 
if the company or montpelier re fails to comply with these covenants or meet these financial ratios  the lenders could declare a default and begin exercising remedies against the collateral  montpelier re would not be able to request the issuance of additional letters of credit and the company would not be able to borrow under the revolving line of credit 
for the year ended december   each of the company and montpelier re was in compliance with all covenants 
effective january  blue ocean entered into a standing agreement for letters of credit with the bank of new york for the provision of a letter of credit facility for the account of blue ocean re in an amount up to million 
there were no letters of credit issued under this facility at december  we expect these letter of credit facilities to be sufficient to support montpelier re s estimated obligations for the next months in the absence of another very major catastrophe 
montpelier re is registered under the insurance act bermuda  amendments thereto and related regulations the act 
under the act  montpelier re is required annually to prepare and file statutory financial statements and a statutory financial return 
the act also requires montpelier re to meet minimum solvency requirements 
for the years ended december  and  montpelier re satisfied these requirements 
bermuda law limits the maximum amount of annual dividends or distributions payable by montpelier re to us and in certain cases requires the prior notification to  or the approval of  the bermuda monetary authority 
subject to such laws  the directors of montpelier re have the unilateral authority to declare or not to declare dividends to us 
there is no assurance that dividends will be declared or paid in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not party to any off balance sheet transaction other than the catastrophe bond  agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party that management believes is reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors

accordingly  we have structured our investment portfolio to preserve capital and provide us with significant liquidity  which means that our investment portfolio contains a significant amount of relatively 
table of contents short term fixed maturity investments  such as us government securities  us government sponsored enterprises securities  corporate debt securities and mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
approximately million of cash and cash equivalents relates to blue ocean which was capitalized in late december and had not invested most of its start up capital by december  the market value of our portfolio of fixed maturity investments is comprised of the following years ended december  in thousands us government securities us government sponsored enterprises securities corporate debt securities mortgage backed and asset backed securities non us government securities total fixed maturity investments all of the fixed maturity investments we currently hold were publicly traded at december  based on the weighted average monthly investments held  and including net unrealized gains losses  foreign exchange gains losses on investments and the foreign exchange effect of insurance balances  our total return for year ended december  was 
the average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio was years and the average rating of the portfolio was aa at december  if the right conditions arise in  we may deploy further capital in strategic investments or investment classes other than existing classes 
we previously had an investment in the common shares of aspen insurance holdings limited aspen  the bermuda based holding company of aspen insurance uk limited aspen re 
during in four separate sales we sold our investment of million shares in aspen for total proceeds of million resulting in a total gain of million 
on august   we invested an aggregate of million as part of an investor group  which included one of our major shareholders  acquiring the life and investments business of safeco corporation since renamed symetra financial corporation  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement 
symetra is an unquoted investment and is carried at estimated fair value at december  of million based on reported net asset values and other information available to management  with the unrealized gain included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
on june   montpelier re invested million in rockridge as part of a total million in common equity raised by rockridge in conjunction with its formation 
in return for montpelier re s investment  montpelier re received  common shares  representing approximately an ownership in rockridge s outstanding common shares 
rockridge  a cayman formed reinsurance company  was established to invest its assets in a fixed income arbitrage strategy and to assume high layer  short tail risks principally from montpelier re 
rockridge is an unquoted investment and is carried at million at december  using the equity method of accounting 
we are actively pursuing non traditional approaches to partner with capital providers to enable them to assume insurance risk 
cash flows in the year ended december   we incurred an operating net cash inflow of million  primarily relating to premiums received by montpelier re net of acquisition costs 
we paid net losses of million and received a net amount of million from investments during the year ended december  as at december  we had a cash balance of million 
net cash provided by operating activities has resulted from premiums received and sales of certain of our fixed maturities and equity investments 

table of contents our sources of funds primarily consist of the receipt of premiums written  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments 
in addition  we will also receive cash as a result of capital raising efforts from time to time 
cash is used primarily to pay loss and loss adjustment expenses  brokerage commissions  excise taxes  general and administrative expenses  to purchase new investments  to pay dividends  to pay for any premiums retroceded and future authorized share repurchases 
in we expect to have a large cash outflow as a result of payment of loss and loss adjustment expenses related to the hurricanes and an increase in our purchase of outwards reinsurance  combined with the lower level of expected gross premiums written for as described above 
our cash flows from operations represent the difference between premiums collected and investment earnings realized  loss and loss adjustment expenses paid  underwriting and other expenses paid and investment gains realized 
cash flows from operations may differ substantially  however  from net income 
we have written certain business that has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity 
this results in volatility in both our results and our operational cash flows 
the potential for large claims or a series of claims under one or more of our insurance or reinsurance contracts means that we may need to make substantial and unpredictable payments within relatively short periods of time 
as a result  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
in addition to relying on premiums received and investment income from our investment portfolio  we intend to meet these cash flow demands by carrying a substantial amount of short and medium term investments that would mature  or possibly be sold  prior to the settlement of our expected liabilities 
no assurance can be given  however  that we will successfully match the structure of our investments with our liabilities 
if our calculations with respect to liabilities are incorrect  or if we improperly structure our investments  we could be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity  potentially at a significant loss 
as we recently raised million in additional capital  even given the large catastrophes that occurred during which will result in large payments for loss and loss adjustment expenses  at this point we do not anticipate having to liquidate any investments prior to maturity 
the estimated fair value of fixed maturity  equity  other investments and cash and cash equivalents balance was  million as of december   compared to  million at december  the primary cause of this increase was the receipt of approximately million due to the issuance of  common shares  the receipt of million in premiums net of acquisition costs and net investment income of million  offset by the payment of a special dividend of million  the payment of regular dividends of million  the payment of claims of million and the increase in net unrealized losses on investments of million 
included in cash and cash equivalents is million related to blue ocean which was capitalized in late december for the period from inception until december   we have had sufficient resources to meet our liquidity requirements 
we have generated cash flows from operations since our inception in excess of our operating commitments 
to the extent that capital is not utilized in our reinsurance or insurance operations we have used such capital to invest in new opportunities and returned capital to shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases under certain circumstances 
as discussed above  we returned million of capital to shareholders and warrant holders by way of a special dividend during the first quarter of we may take additional capital management measures in the future 
on january   the company raised million through a private sale of trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities were issued by a newly formed statutory trust  montpelier capital trust iii  which is wholly owned by the company 
the securities have a fixed rate of interest of per annum through march   and thereafter a floating interest rate of month libor plus basis points  reset quarterly 
the securities mature on march   and may be called at par by the company at any time after march  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to four types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
the company has in place a derivatives use plan 
however  it has not entered into any derivative contracts to date with the exception of the catastrophe bond 
interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
our fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio falls  and the converse is also true 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity to seek to maximize total risk adjusted returns while maintaining a significant portion of the portfolio in relatively short term investments that would mature or could be sold to satisfy anticipated cash needs arising from montpelier re s reinsurance liabilities 
as of december   an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio of or approximately million and the impact on our portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as of december   an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio of or approximately million and the impact on our portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as of december   we held million  or of our total invested assets  in mortgage related securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  which occurs when holders of individual mortgages increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
given the proportion that these securities comprise of the overall portfolio  and the current low interest rate environment  prepayment risk is not considered significant at this time 
as of december   we held million  or of our total invested assets  in mortgage related securities 
foreign currency risk 
a significant portion of our business is reinsuring or insuring risks  receiving premiums and paying losses in foreign currencies 
we also maintain a small portion of our investment portfolio in investments in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to fluctuations in the rates of these currencies 
in the event of a significant loss event which requires settlement in a foreign currency  we may use forward foreign currency exchange contracts or investments in non dollar denominated securities in an effort to hedge against movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar 
a forward foreign currency exchange contract involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specified currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract 
foreign currency exchange contracts will not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
we do not expect to enter into such contracts with respect to a material amount of our assets 
at december  and  we did not have any outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts  but we did have investments in non dollar denominated securities 
in addition  a third party manages a portfolio of our global common equities and we currently do not hedge the non dollar exposures in this portfolio 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
the british pound is the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiary  montpelier marketing services uk limited mmsl 
accordingly  mmsl s assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of mmsl are translated at average exchange rates during the period 
the effect of translation adjustments at the end of the period is not included in our consolidated results of operations but is included in accumulated other 
table of contents comprehensive income  a separate component of shareholders equity 
on a consolidated basis  mmsl does not generate material revenue and expenses and  therefore  the effects of changes in exchange rates during the period are not material 
our premiums receivable and liabilities for losses incurred in foreign currencies are exposed to the risk of changes in value resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and may affect our financial results in the future 
credit risk 
we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed maturity investments 
in accordance with our investment guidelines as approved by our board of directors  our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
all of our fixed maturity investments were publicly traded at december   and were investment grade 
all of our fixed maturity investments were publicly traded and were investment grade at december  equity price risk our portfolio of equity securities  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
changes in fair value of our equity portfolio are recorded as unrealized appreciation depreciation and are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
effects of inflation the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
we take into account the anticipated effects on us in our catastrophe loss models 
the effects of inflation are also considered in pricing and in estimating reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
however  we cannot know the precise effects of inflation on our results until claims are ultimately settled 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates
