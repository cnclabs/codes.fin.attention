ebitda is a non gaap financial measure of earnings net income from continuing operations before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
this term  as used and defined by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  
table of contents net income or loss  cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities  or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  management believes ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is widely used by investors in the energy industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of ebitda  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors  it helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating structure  and it is used by our management for various purposes  including as a measure of operating performance  in presentations to our board of directors  as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting  and as a component for setting incentive compensation 
there are material limitations to using ebitda as a measure of performance  including the inability to analyze the impact of certain recurring items that materially affect our net income or loss  and the lack of comparability of results of operations of different companies

overview we fabricate  manufacture  rent and sell natural gas compressors and related equipment 
our primary focus is on the rental of natural gas compressors 
our rental contracts generally provide for initial terms of six to months 
after the initial term of our rental contracts  most of our customers have continued to rent our compressors on a month to month basis 
rental amounts are paid monthly in advance and include maintenance of the rented compressors 
as of december   we had natural gas compressors totaling  horsepower rented to third parties  compared to natural gas compressors totaling  horsepower rented to third parties at december  of the natural gas compressors  were rented to dominion exploration production  inc and its affiliates 
we also fabricate natural gas compressors for sale to our customers  designing compressors to meet unique specifications dictated by well pressures  production characteristics and particular applications for which compression is sought 
fabrication of compressors involves the purchase by us of engines  compressors  coolers and other components  and then assembling these components on skids for delivery to customer locations 
these major components of our compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third party suppliers on an as needed basis  which presently requires a three to four month lead time with delivery dates scheduled to 
table of contents coincide with our estimated production schedules 
although we do not have formal continuing supply contracts with any major supplier  we believe we have adequate alternative sources available 
in the past  we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in the prices of the major components for our compressors 
however  the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition  particularly if we were unable to increase our rental rates and sales prices proportionate to any such component price increases 
we also manufacture a proprietary line of compressor frames  cylinders and parts  known as our cip cylinder in plane product line 
we use finished cip component products in the fabrication of compressor units for sale or rental by us or sell the finished component products to other compressor fabricators 
we also design  fabricate  sell  install and service flare stacks and related ignition and control devices for onshore and offshore incineration of gas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide  carbon dioxide  natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases 
to provide customer support for our compressor and flare sales businesses  we stock varying levels of replacement parts at our midland  texas facility and at field service locations 
we also provide an exchange and rebuild program for screw compressors and maintain an inventory of new and used compressors to facilitate this business 
we provide service and maintenance to our customers under written maintenance contracts or on an as required basis in the absence of a service contract 
maintenance agreements typically have terms of six months to one year and require payment of a monthly fee 
the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our three business segments for the periods presented year ended december  in thousands sales service and maintenance rental total on january   we completed the acquisition of screw compression systems  inc  or scs  for consideration consisting of million in cash  subordinated promissory notes payable by us to the former stockholders of scs in the aggregate principal amount of million  and  shares of our common stock 
as a result of this acquisition  our results of operations for periods before and after the completion of the acquisition may not be comparable 
historically  the majority of our revenues and income from operations has come from our compressor rental business 
the acquisition of scs  which is engaged primarily in the business of custom fabrication of compressors for sale to third parties  significantly altered the mix of our revenues  with compressor sales now contributing the largest percentage of our revenues 
margins for our rental business have recently averaged to  while margins for the compressor sales business have recently averaged approximately 
as a result of the scs acquisition  therefore  our overall margins have declined in compared to prior periods because of the difference in our product mix 
our strategy for growth is focused on our compressor rental business  and we intend to use the additional fabrication capacity now available through scs to expand our rental fleet while continuing scs s core custom fabrication business 
as our rental business grows and contributes a larger percentage of our total revenues  we expect our overall margins to improve from those experienced in the oil and gas equipment rental and services industry is cyclical in nature 
the most critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for natural gas and the corresponding changes in commodity prices 
as demand and prices increase  oil and gas producers increase their capital expenditures for drilling  development and production activities 
generally  the increased capital expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for services and equipment companies 

table of contents in general  we expect our overall business activity and revenues to track the level of activity in the natural gas industry  with changes in domestic natural gas production and consumption levels and prices more significantly affecting our business than changes in crude oil and condensate production and consumption levels and prices 
we also believe that demand for compression services and products is driven by declining reservoir pressure in maturing natural gas producing fields and  more recently  by increased focus by producers on non conventional natural gas production  such as coalbed methane  gas shales and tight gas  which typically requires more compression than production from conventional natural gas reservoirs 
demand for our products and services have been strong throughout and we believe demand will remain strong throughout due to high oil and natural gas prices and increased demand for natural gas 
because of these market fundamentals for natural gas  we believe the long term trend of activity in our markets is favorable 
however  these factors could be more than offset by other developments affecting the worldwide supply and demand for natural gas 
additionally  activity created by recent increases in the price of natural gas may make it difficult to meet the demands of our markets 
our five year rental and maintenance agreement with dominion exploration expired on december  dominion exploration accounted for approximately and of our consolidated revenues in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
in august  we were advised by dominion exploration that it would seek competing proposals from us as well as other third parties to continue the rental and maintenance services required for its northern michigan operations 
we submitted a bid to rent screw compressors to dominion exploration and to provide maintenance and service on certain screw compressors owned by dominion exploration 
we also submitted a proposal to continue service and maintenance of reciprocating compressors owned by dominion exploration 
in october  we were advised by dominion exploration that we will retain the screw compressor rental  maintenance and service businesses  but that a third party was successful in bidding for the maintenance and service of dominion exploration s reciprocating compressors 
we estimate that the screw compressor rental  maintenance and service business we have retained from dominion exploration represented approximately and of our revenues from dominion exploration in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
for fiscal year  our forecasted capital expenditures are approximately to million  primarily for additions to our compressor rental fleet 
we believe that the proceeds from our recently completed public offering of common stock  together with funds available to us under our bank credit facility and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital and liquidity requirements through we may further require additional capital to fund any unanticipated expenditures  including any acquisitions of other businesses 
additional capital may not be available to us when we need it or on acceptable terms 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below shows our revenues  percentage of total revenues  gross profit  exclusive of depreciation  and gross profit margin of each of our segments for the years ended december  and december  the gross profit margin is the ratio  expressed as a percentage  of gross profit  exclusive of depreciation  to total revenue 
revenue gross profit  exclusive of depreciation year ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands sales service and maintenance rental total total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue reflects the increase in our rental revenue and the addition of revenue from our acquisition of scs 

table of contents sales revenue increased from million to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase is mainly the result of the sale of compressor units to outside third parties by scs 
service and maintenance revenue increased from million to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase is mainly the result of additional third party labor sales in our new mexico area and michigan branches 
rental revenue increased from million to million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase is mainly the result of units added to our rental fleet and rented to third parties 
at december   we had compressor packages in our rental fleet  up from units at december  the average monthly rental rate per unit at december  was  as compared to  at december  the overall gross margin percentage  exclusive of depreciation  decreased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  this decrease resulted mainly from the relative increase in compressor sales revenue as a percentage of the total revenue 
our rental fleet carried a gross margin averaging for  and compressor and parts sales margins averaged 
selling  general and administrative expense increased from million to million or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this was mainly the result of the increased expenses attributed to the acquisition of scs 
scs accounted for approximately million of the total selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense increased from million to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was the result of new gas compressor rental units being added to rental equipment from december  to december   thus increasing the depreciable base 
other income decreased approximately million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in this decrease was due mainly to the million that was received in the year ended december  as life insurance proceeds from the death of our former chief executive officer  offset by additional interest income from our money market accounts in interest expense increased by million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the same period ended december   mainly due to increased debt incurred to finance rental equipment additions  debt related to the acquisition of scs and increased interest rates 
provision for income tax increased by million  or  because taxable income increased after giving effect to the non taxable life insurance proceeds received in 
table of contents year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below shows our revenues  percentage of total revenues  gross profit  exclusive of depreciation  and gross profit margin of each of our segments for the years ended december  and december  revenue gross profit  exclusive of depreciation year ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands sales service and maintenance rental total total revenue increased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period ended december  this was mainly the result of increased rental income as discussed below 
sales revenue decreased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period ended december  sales included compressor unit sales  flare sales  parts sales and compressor rebuilds 
this decrease was mainly the result of a reduction in the sale of compressor units to outside third parties 
because our products are custom built  fluctuations in revenue from outside sources are not unusual and our focus has been more on building a rental base than on the sale of equipment 
service and maintenance revenue increased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period ended december  this was mainly the result of increased revenue from third party overhaul and maintenance labor billings 
rental revenue increased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period ended december  this increase was the result of additional units added to our rental fleet and rented to third parties 
we ended the year with compressor packages in our rental fleet  up from units at december  the gross margin percentage  exclusive of depreciation  increased from for the twelve months ended december   to for the same period ended december  this improvement resulted mainly from the relative increase in rental revenue as a percentage of the total revenue and improvement in rental gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million to million  or  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the same period ended december  this was mainly the result of the increase in commissions from additional rental contracts on gas compressors to third parties  and an increase in professional fees related to regulatory filings and sarbanes oxley compliance matters 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december  this increase was the result of new gas compressor rental units being added to our rental fleet for the year 
interest expense increased approximately  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december   mainly due to the increased debt incurred to finance vehicles and rental equipment 
other income and expense increased approximately million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period ended december  this increase was due mainly to the receipt of million in life insurance proceeds payable in connection with the death of mr 
wayne l 
vinson  our former chief executive officer 

table of contents provision for income tax increased approximately  or  primarily due to the increase in net taxable income 
the income from the life insurance proceeds described above is not subject to federal income tax 
for the year ended december   total preferred stock dividends of  were reflected in our net income attributable to common stockholders 
each holder of our convertible series a preferred stock was entitled to receive cumulative dividends in preference to any dividend on the common stock at the rate of of the liquidation value per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends of the convertible series a preferred stock 
dividends were payable in arrears thirty days after the end of each calendar quarter 
as of march   all of the preferred stock had been converted into  shares of common stock 
net income available to common stockholders for the year increased mainly from increased rental activity and life insurance proceeds 
critical accounting policies and practices we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and valuation of inventory revenue recognition revenue from the sales of custom and fabricated compressors  and flare systems is recognized upon shipment of the equipment to customers 
exchange and rebuild compressor revenue is recognized when both the replacement compressor has been delivered and the rebuild assessment has been completed 
revenue from compressor services is recognized upon providing services to the customer 
maintenance agreement revenue is recognized as services are rendered 
rental revenue is recognized over the terms of the respective rental agreements based upon the classification of the rental agreement 
deferred income represents payments received before a product is shipped 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
at december   approximately of our accounts receivable were concentrated in two of our customers  devon energy corporation and pogo producing company 
at december   xto energy  inc accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of this customer could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 

table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our federal income taxes as well as income taxes in each of the states in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in  statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill as of january  in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill 
based upon evaluations in june  december and june of our reporting units with goodwill  we did not record an impairment charge during either year 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb published fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment statement r  requiring that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we will be required to apply statement r as of january  statement r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement  as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 

table of contents the company has adopted statement r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
the company expects approximately  to be expensed in as a result of options vesting during in november  the fasb issued sfas no  inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
this standard provides clarification that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  this standard requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this standard are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to protection of human safety and health and the environment  affect our operations and costs 
compliance with these laws and regulations could cause us to incur remediation or other corrective action costs or result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations 
in addition  we have acquired certain properties and plant facilities from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control 
under environmental laws and regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners 
in addition  we could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for properties and plant facilities we lease  but do not own 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business  but has not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
it is not anticipated  based on current laws and regulations  that we will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total expenditure budget in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but  such laws and regulations are frequently changed and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
we also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which we send equipment and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations through public and private offerings of our equity securities  subordinated debt  bank borrowings and cash flow from operations 
proceeds of financings were primarily used to repay debt  to fund the manufacture and fabrication of additional units for our rental fleet of natural gas compressors and for acquisitions 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  working capital of approximately million  and bank debt of approximately million  of which approximately million was classified as current 
we had approximately million of net cash flow from operating activities during the twelve months ending december  this was primarily from net income of approximately million  plus depreciation and amortization of approximately million and increases in deferred taxes of approximately million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory of approximately million and million  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   we invested approximately million in equipment for our rental fleet and in service vehicles 
we financed this activity with bank debt and cash flow from operations 
we borrowed approximately million from our bank in  which included million to finance the acquisition of scs 
we also repaid million of our existing debt during at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  working capital of million and total debt of million  of which approximately million was classified as current 
at that same date  the subordinated debt was secured by letters of credit in the aggregate face amount of million 
we had positive net cash flow from operating activities of approximately million during this was primarily from net income of million  plus depreciation and amortization of million  an increase in deferred taxes of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable trade of million  deferred income of million  and an increase in inventory of million 
we do not expect to pay federal income taxes for or because of our existing net operating loss carryforwards and the additional tax benefit anticipated due to book tax differences on the depreciation of our rental fleet 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments we have contractual obligations and commitments that affect our consolidated results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the following table is a summary of our significant cash contractual obligations obligation due in period cash contractual obligations thereafter total in thousands credit facility secured interest on credit facility subordinated debt facilities and office leases purchase obligations total senior bank borrowings on january   we entered into a sixth amended and restated loan agreement  or loan agreement  with western national bank  midland  texas 
this loan agreement continued and carried forward  without change  our previously existing advancing line of credit and term loan facilities  and modified our revolving line of credit facility 
our revolving line of credit  term loan and advancing line of credit facilities are described below 
revolving line of credit facility 
our revolving line of credit facility allows us to borrow  repay and reborrow funds drawn under this facility 
before entering into the sixth amended and restated loan agreement  the total amount that we could borrow and have outstanding at any one time was limited to the lesser of million or the amount available for advances under a borrowing base calculation established by the bank 
as of december   the amount available for revolving line of credit advances under our borrowing base was million  and the principal amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit at the same date was  the amount of the borrowing base is based primarily upon our receivables  equipment and inventory 
the borrowing base is redetermined by the bank on a monthly basis 
if  as a result of the redetermination of the borrowing base  the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes payable to the bank under the loan agreement exceeds the borrowing base  we must first prepay the principal of the revolving line of credit note in an amount equal to such excess  and if the excess is not eliminated by the prepayment  we must then prepay the principal of the other notes payable under the loan agreement until the excess is eliminated 
interest only on borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility is payable monthly on the first day of each month 
loans made to us under the revolving line of credit bear interest at the prime rate plus 
as of december   our interest rate on the revolving line of credit was 
the outstanding principal balance and all unpaid interest on the revolving line of credit facility was originally due and payable on january  upon entering into the sixth amended and restated loan agreement  the revolving line of credit was renewed  the maturity was extended from january  to december   and the principal amount we are able to borrow under this revolving facility was increased from million to million  subject to borrowing base limitations 
at march   we had available approximately million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility 

table of contents million multiple advance term loan facility 
this multiple advance term loan facility allowed us to request advances from time to time through march  in an aggregate amount not to exceed the lesser of million or the amount available for advances under the borrowing base established by the bank 
re borrowings are not permitted under this facility 
as of december   no additional amounts were available for advances under this facility  and the principal amount outstanding under this multiple term advance loan facility at december  was million 
loans made to us under this facility bear interest at the greater of the prime rate plus or 
as of december   our interest rate on the multiple advance term loan facility was 
interest only under this credit facility is due and payable on the first day of each month commencing may  and continuing through april  principal under this credit facility is due and payable in monthly installments in an amount equal to th of the outstanding principal balance on may  with a like installment due on the first day of each succeeding month through march   with interest on the unpaid principal balance being due and payable on the same dates as principal payments

as of december   our interest rate on this term loan facility was 
principal under this credit facility is due and payable in monthly installments of  each  commencing february  and continuing through december  interest on the unpaid principal balance is due and payable on the same dates as principal payments 
all outstanding principal and unpaid interest is due on january  during the year ended december   we paid the principal amount of three term loan facilities and other debt in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
scs has guaranteed payment of all of the above loans 
our obligations under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our properties and assets  including our equipment  trade accounts receivable and other personal property  the stock we own in scs  and by the real estate and related plant facilities owned by scs 
the maturity dates of the loan facilities may be accelerated by the bank upon the occurrence of an event of default under the loan agreement 

table of contents the loan agreement contains various restrictive covenants and compliance requirements 
these requirements provide that we must have at the end of each month  a consolidated current ratio as defined in the loan agreement of at least to  at the end of each month  consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the loan agreement of at least million  at the end of each fiscal quarter  a debt service coverage ratio as defined in the loan agreement of at least to  and at the end of each month  a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth as such terms are defined in the loan agreement of less than to the loan agreement also contains restrictions on incurring additional debt and paying dividends 
as of december   we were in compliance with all material covenants in our loan agreement 
a default under our bank credit facility could trigger the acceleration of our bank debt so that it is immediately due and payable 
such default would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position and operations 
subordinated debt and related letters of credit the principal amounts of the promissory notes issued to the three stockholders of scs in the scs acquisition are payable in three equal annual installments  commencing on january  accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of the notes is payable on the same dates as  and in addition to  the installments of principal 
subject to the consent of the holder of each respective note  principal payments may be made by us in shares of our common stock valued at the average daily closing prices of the common stock on the american stock exchange for the twenty consecutive trading days commencing thirty trading days before the due date of the principal payment  or by combination of cash and shares of common stock 
under the terms of our loan agreement with our bank lender  we are prohibited from making payments on these notes if at the time of any such payment we are then in default under the loan agreement or if any such payment would cause or result in a default under the loan agreement 
to secure payment of these notes  our bank lender issued for our account three separate letters of credit for the benefit of the holders of the notes in the aggregate face amount of million 
the letters of credit expire february  drafts for payment under the letters of credit may be made by the beneficiaries only upon our default in payment of the notes 
if a draft for payment is not presented on or before february   the face amount of the letter of credit will automatically be reduced by one half 
components of our principal capital expenditures the table below sets out components of our principal capital expenditures for the three years ended december   along with the total budgeted for  excluding acquisitions actual budgeted expenditure category excluding acquisitions in thousands rental equipment  vehicles and shop equipment     to  
table of contents the level of our expenditures will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
based upon existing economic and market conditions  we believe that the proceeds from our recently completed public offering of common stock  our operating cash flow and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to fully fund our net investing cash requirements for we also believe we have significant flexibility with respect to our financing alternatives and adjustment of our expenditure plans if circumstances warrant 
when considered in relation to our total financial capacity  we do not have any material continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to our current operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in financial transactions  including guaranties of debt  that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
such entities  often referred to as variable interest entities or special purpose entities  are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we were not involved in any unconsolidated financial transactions with variable interest or special purpose entities during any of the reporting periods in this annual report on form k and have no intention to participate in such transactions in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity risk our commodity risk exposure is the pricing applicable to oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas  companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail their drilling programs  thereby reducing demand for our equipment and services 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
we rely heavily upon debt financing provided by our bank lender 
most of these instruments contain interest provisions that are at least a one half percentage point above the published prime rate 
this creates a vulnerability to us relative to the movement of the prime rate 
as the prime rate increases  our cost of funds will increase and affect our ability to obtain additional debt 
we have not engaged in any hedging activities to offset these risks 
at december   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations on approximately million of bank borrowings carrying adjustable interest rates 
a hypothetical one hundred basis point increase in interest rates for these notes payable would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates and the specific actions that might be taken by us to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
financial instruments and debt maturities our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments

customer credit risk we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers
