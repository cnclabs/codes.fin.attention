item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview vse organization vse s business operations consist primarily of services performed by the company s unincorporated divisions and wholly owned subsidiary 
the company uses multiple operating entities to bid on and perform contract work 
the use of an operating structure with multiple entities gives the company certain competitive advantages and the flexibility to pursue a diverse business base 
the term vse or company refers to vse and its divisions and subsidiaries unless the context indicates operations of the parent company only 
unincorporated divisions include bav division bav  communications and engineering division ced  coast guard division vcg  engineering and logistics division eld beginning in  fleet maintenance division fmd  management sciences division msd  and systems engineering division sed 
energetics incorporated energetics is currently vse s only active subsidiary 
vse previously conducted business operations in other subsidiaries and divisions during the past three year period that have been dissolved or became inactive prior to december  these include human resource systems  inc hrsi  dissolved in  telecommunications technologies division ttd  discontinued operations in and information assurance division iad  formerly value systems services division or vss  inactive as of may vse customers and services the company is engaged principally in providing engineering  design  logistics  management and technical services to the us government the government  other government prime contractors  and commercial entities 
the largest customer for the company s services is the us department of defense defense  including agencies of the us navy  army  and air force 
navy the majority of vse s work is performed for the us navy 
bav is a major provider of logistics  training  and technical assistance in support of the navy s foreign military sales fms ship transfer program 
fmd supports the navy by providing a variety of services including ship systems installation efforts  combat systems inspections  ship repair and overhaul availability planning  weapons management  ordnance alterations  and air combat logistics 
vcg provides services to the us coast guard that are similar to the work performed by bav for the us navy and its fms customers 
army army reserve vse also performs a significant amount of its work for the us army and us army reserve 
vse  through sed and eld  provides these customers equipment refurbishment services  military vehicle protection systems  engineering and technical support for ground weapons  logistics and training services  material procurement support  and prototype development support for combat vehicles 
msd provides the army  as well as other government agencies and commercial organizations  with training services in quality systems and product  process  and management optimization 
ced provides management oversight and coordinates support efforts for a variety of government work orders on a large army contract 
other energetics provides the department of energy and other government and industry customers with expert consulting services that typically include program planning and analysis  r d management services  technology assessment and performance metrics  communications and outreach  and conference planning 
vse provides base support and other services to the us air force through contract work performed by fmd and sed 
the company has also provided support services to the us postal service and us department of treasury 
vse revenues by customer dollars in thousands source of revenue revenues revenues revenues navy    army army reserve    other    total revenues    bav ship transfer program vse s bav division provides the us navy with engineering  technical and logistical support services associated with the sale  lease  or transfer of navy ships to foreign governments 
during its life  this program has been the company s single largest revenue producer 
revenues generated by this program have typically accounted for approximately to of consolidated vse revenues  and revenues generated by this program accounted for approximately and of consolidated revenues in and  respectively 
the level of revenues and associated profits resulting from fee income generated by this program varies depending on a number of factors  including the timing of ship transfers and associated support services ordered by foreign governments and economic conditions of potential customers worldwide 
the company has experienced significant quarterly and annual revenue fluctuations and anticipates that future quarterly and annual revenues will be subject to variation due to changes in the level of activity associated with the navy s ship transfer program 
the transfer of four us navy ships to taiwan currently conducted under this program is a major contributor to the company s revenues in and the original contract associated with this program was a ten year cost plus award fee contract awarded in with a total ceiling value of more than billion 
bav was awarded a second contract in april to continue work on this program 
the new contract is a five year cost plus award fee contract with a total ceiling value of approximately million 
the navy began issuing orders on the new contract in the second quarter of and ceased issuing orders for new work on the original contract at that time 
bav will continue work associated with the transfer of four ships to taiwan under delivery orders previously issued on the original contract until the work is completed and all four ships are delivered to taiwan 
contract terms under both the original and new contracts specify base fee payments and award fee payments to bav 
base fee payments are determined by level of contract activity and base fee income is recognized each month 
award fee payments are determined by performance and level of contract activity 
a contract modification authorizing the award fee payment is issued subsequent to the period in which the work is performed 
the company does not recognize award fee income until the fees are fixed and determinable  generally upon contract notification confirming the award fee 
award fees are made three times during the year 
accordingly  the company typically has three quarterly reporting periods per year that include the recognition of bav award fee income and one quarterly reporting period that does not include bav award fee income 
due to such timing  and to fluctuations in the level of revenues  profits as a percentage of revenues will fluctuate from period to period 
in and  each of the three month periods ended december  june  and march  includes bav award fee income 
the three month periods ended september  and do not include bav award fee income 
tbps program in november  vse s sed division began work on a program to provide a protection system  the tanker ballistic protection system tbps  for vehicles deployed by the us army in iraq 
under this program  sed applies a fuel tank self sealing system and necessary add on armor panels for army fuel dispensing tankers as protection from damage resulting from hostile fire 
testing and preparatory work was conducted in november and december and delivery of completed vehicle protection systems began in january sed has multiple firm fixed price per unit contracts under which it is performing the tbps program 
subsequent to award  vse has received modifications to the contracts to adjust the number of tankers based on army tanker availability and needs  and the possibility remains that there may be future modifications to these contracts as the army s needs change 
the current funded contract ceiling for the tbps program contracts is approximately million as of december  contractual coverage for work on the tbps program runs through january and the company expects to most likely complete work in early the tbps program has contributed significantly to vse revenue growth in the work performed on this program also significantly increases the amount of fixed price contract work performed by the company 
in general  fixed price contract work carries a higher level of risk and has higher profit margins than work on other contract types 
accordingly  the tbps program has presented  and is expected to continue to present  vse s business with the potential for both increased profit margins and increased risks of incurring a loss 
ced army equipment support program in december  vse s ced division was awarded a task order on its rapid response support contract to provide maintenance and logistics services in support of us army equipment in iraq and afghanistan 
services provided under this program include deployed sustainment management  deployed logistics and repairs management  unique system training and curriculum support  resource management  and acquisition and administrative support 
work on this program began in the task order for this program is time and materials  with substantially all of the services provided by ced s subcontractor 
ced will provide certain program management services 
the contract task order has a base year valued at approximately million and an additional one year option period valued at approximately million 
this program is expected to contribute significantly to vse s revenues in and  however  profit margins on subcontract work are lower than on work performed by company personnel 
government procurement policies and practices vse s business is subject to the risks arising from economic conditions and political factors that may impact the budgets and program funding of customers served through vse s contracts 
vse s revenues have historically been subject to annual fluctuations resulting from changes in the level of defense spending 
future budgetary and funding decisions by government lawmakers or defense restructuring efforts could affect the types and level of services provided by vse to its government customers and could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the revenues of the company depend on its ability to win new contracts and on the amount of work ordered by the government under the company s existing contracts 
the company s ability to win new contracts is affected by government acquisition policies and procedures  including government procurement practices that in some years have tended toward bundling work efforts under large comprehensive management contracts omnibus 
this emphasis on large contracts presents challenges to winning new contract work  including making it more difficult for the company to qualify as a bidder  increasing the level of competition due to the award of fewer contracts  and forcing the company into competition with larger businesses that have greater financial resources and larger technical staffs 
competing for these contracts requires the company to use teams of subcontractors to be able to offer the range of technical competencies needed to do the work 
while the use of subcontractors on a large scale basis allows the company to compete for this work  profit margins on subcontract work are lower than on work performed by company personnel  thereby reducing the company s overall profit margins 
the use of subcontractors on government contracts also raises certain performance and financial risks to vse in that government prime contractors are responsible for performing to the requirements of the contract and ensuring compliance with us government regulations relative to the performance by subcontractors 
other government procurement practices that can affect the company s revenues are the length of contracts issued  which may vary depending on changes in contracting regulations and other factors  the use of past performance criteria that may preclude entrance into new government markets  and government socioeconomic programs that limit contract work to small  woman  or minority owned businesses 
additional risk factors that could potentially affect the company s results of operations are the government s right to terminate contracts for convenience  the government s right to not exercise all of the option periods on a contract  and funding delays caused by government political or administrative actions 
global economic conditions and political factors vse s business is subject to the risks arising from global economic conditions and political factors associated with current and potential customers served through vse s contracts with the us government 
an economic slowdown in countries served under the bav ship transfer program could potentially affect sales 
failure by the government of a potential foreign customer to approve and fund acquisition of us navy ships serviced under this program could affect sales 
in any one year  a significant amount of the company s revenues may result from sales on the bav ship transfer program to a single foreign government 
bav sales to egypt have historically comprised a large percentage of the company s total sales in any one year 
work associated with the transfer of four ships to taiwan under the bav ship transfer program during and also comprised a large percentage of total sales 
the current international situation posed by potential terrorist activity and the continuing conflict in the middle east could potentially increase the political risks for revenues from the bav ship transfer  tbps  and ced army equipment support programs 
international tensions can also affect work by fmd on us navy ships when they are deployed outside of us navy facilities and are unavailable for maintenance work during this time period 
adverse results arising from these global economic and political risks could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations

the taiwan ship transfer work by bav also increased revenues and continued to be the company s single largest work effort 
several of vse s other divisions also contributed to revenue growth in work on the tpbs program began contributing to vse s profits  and each of vse s active business units showed improved profits in see results of operations below for a more detailed discussion of results 
more growth ahead subject to the risk elements discussed above  vse expects to continue to increase revenues and profits in reasons for this expectation include ced army equipment support program ced began work on this program in the program is new work and is expected to increase company revenues significantly in and the contract task order for this program is incrementally funded  with funded backlog of approximately million as of december  tbps program sed began delivery of completed vehicle protection systems on this program in the program is expected to continue in with increased levels of production 
funded backlog on the tbps program was approximately million as of december   as compared to approximately million as of december  taiwan ship transfer the taiwan ship transfer effort is expected to continue through mid to late  allowing bav to maintain revenue levels in similar to funded backlog on the bav ship transfer program was approximately million as of december   as compared to approximately million as of december  other significant contracts vse has three multiyear  multiple award  indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity contracts that have large nominal ceiling amounts with no funding committed at the time of award 
vse is one of several awardees on each contract 
while future vse revenue from these contracts cannot be predicted with certainty  the award of these contracts provides the company with the opportunity to compete for work that could contribute to future revenue growth  including new work in these three contracts are described below 
vse s ced division has a multi year rapid response support contract issued by the us army communications electronics command cecom that was awarded in january the contract enhances the company s revenue producing capabilities by allowing it to provide services through any of vse s operating entities or through third party subcontractors for various end user government customers 
if all options are exercised  this contract has a potential total ceiling of approximately billion over an eight year period 
while it is not likely that the full ceiling amount will be realized  this contract has generated revenues for vse of approximately million and million during and  respectively 
the ced army equipment support program is expected to add significantly to this contract s and the company s revenues in vse continues to pursue new orders on this contract that present potential revenue opportunities for the future 
vse s fmd division has a contract with the us navy  seaport enhanced  awarded in april  which includes a five year base period and two five year option periods 
this contract is a procurement vehicle for the navy to use for ordering services from a wide range of contractors to support all phases of naval ship and shipboard weapons systems acquisition and life cycle support 
while this award does not guarantee any revenues for vse  the company is one of several contractors eligible to bid for services during the life of the contract 
to date  fmd has generated only minor amounts of revenue from this contract 
fmd also has a contract  awarded in september  with the us navy to provide engineering and technical services to support naval sea systems command maintenance  overhaul  repair  and alteration of systems aboard ships 
this contract has a total contract ceiling amount of billion over a five year period if all option periods are exercised 
vse is one of several awardees eligible to share in the potential total contract ceiling amount 
since the date of the contract award  fmd has been awarded delivery orders with ceilings valued at approximately million on this contract  of which approximately million has been funded 
although it is not likely that the full billion ceiling amount will be realized  this contract presents potential future revenue opportunities 
increases in bookings and funded backlog revenue increases in government contracting businesses such as that experienced by vse in and are typically preceded by increases in contract funding bookings and a build up of funded contract backlog

longer term concerns and risks certain work efforts that have supported vse s growth in and and that are expected to support continued growth in are due to expire in the future 
vse has received significant contributions to its revenue growth in from the taiwan ship transfer work and in from both the taiwan ship transfer work and the tbps program work 
these two programs and the ced army equipment support program are expected to be the largest contributors to vse revenue in the taiwan ship transfer work is expected to be substantially completed in late the tbps program contractual coverage runs through january  and the company expects to continue work on the program through and into early the company has no indication that there will be any further work ordered on the tbps program beyond early the ced army equipment support program will be performed under a two year contract task order in and the company does not know of any additional contractual coverage that may be issued to continue vse s work on this program 
the expected expiration of these programs will present challenges for vse to sustain the revenue growth that it experienced during and  and that it expects to experience  in years beyond vse is tracking multiple bidding opportunities for new contract work and is also exploring potential acquisition opportunities to mitigate the future loss of revenues associated with the expiration of the taiwan ship transfer  tbps  and ced army equipment support work 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision to sfas sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the company adopted sfas r  using the modified prospective method  on january  if vse had adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 
the impact of adopting sfas r is expected to be an increase in expenses  net of related tax effects  of approximately thousand in sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
the amount of operating cash flows recognized for each of the last three years for such excess tax deductions were approximately thousand  thousand  and thousand for  and  respectively 
on december   vse s board of directors the board directed vse to discontinue awarding options  both discretionary and nondiscretionary  to purchase vse common stock vse stock under vse s stock option plan approved by vse stockholders on may  the plan 
the options outstanding under the plan as of december   and the options to purchase shares of vse stock under vse s stock option plan the plan are not affected by this board action 
the primary reason for the board s suspension of option awards under the plan was the potential impact on vse s results of operations from the application of sfas r to share based payments to employees  including stock option awards 
critical accounting policies vse s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require vse to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting polices affect our more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of the company s services are performed for its customers on a contract basis 
the three primary types of contracts used are cost type contracts  time and materials contracts  and fixed price contracts 
revenues result from work performed on these contracts by the company s employees and from pass through of costs for material and work performed by subcontractors 
revenues on cost type contracts are recorded as contract allowable costs are incurred and fees earned 
profits on cost type contracts are equal to the fees that are earned 
the bav contract terms specify award fee payments that are determined by performance and level of contract activity 
award fees are made three times during the year and a contract modification authorizing the award fee payment is issued subsequent to the period in which the work is performed 
the company does not recognize award fee income until the fees are fixed and determinable  generally upon contract notification confirming the award fee 
due to such timing  and to fluctuations in the level of revenues  profits as a percentage of revenues on this contract will fluctuate from period to period 
revenues for time and materials contracts are recorded on the basis of contract allowable labor hours worked multiplied by the contract defined billing rates  plus the direct costs and indirect cost burdens associated with materials and subcontract work used in performance on the contract 
profits on time and material contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract defined billing rates for these services 
revenue recognition methods on fixed price contracts will vary depending on the nature of the work and the contract terms 
on certain fixed price contracts revenues are recorded as costs are incurred  using the percentage of completion method of accounting  since these contracts require design  engineering  and manufacturing performed to the customer s specifications 
revenues on fixed price service contracts are recorded as work is performed 
revenues on fixed price contracts that require delivery of specific items may be recorded based on a price per unit as units are delivered 
profits on fixed price contracts result from the difference between the incurred costs and the revenue earned 
certain direct and incremental contract costs have been deferred and reported as a current asset prior to the recognition of revenue 
such costs are realizable over the life of the contract 
revenues by contract type for the three years ended december  were as follows in thousands contract type revenues revenues revenues cost type 




   time and materials 
   fixed price 



   the company will occasionally perform work at risk  which is work that is performed prior to the government formalizing funding for such work 
revenue related to work performed at risk is not recognized until it can be reliably estimated and its realization is probable 
vse recognizes this risk funding as revenue when the associated costs are incurred or the work is performed 
vse is at risk of loss for any risk funding not received 
revenues recognized in include approximately thousand for which the company had not received formalized funding as of december  the company received funding modifications for approximately thousand of this amount as of february  leaving approximately thousand of revenues classified as risk funding 
vse believes that it will receive funding for this remaining risk funding revenue 
long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  vse must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  vse may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to a review for impairment at least annually 
the company performs its annual impairment test on september as of december   the company had approximately million of unamortized goodwill associated with its acquisition of energetics in the company has not recognized any reduction to the goodwill due to the impairment rules 
if at some time in the future it is determined that impairment has occurred  such impairment could potentially have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
contingencies from time to time vse is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor and other matters 
vse is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly 
the amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy 
income taxes the carrying value of vse net deferred tax assets is based on assumptions regarding vse s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these deferred tax assets 
if the estimates and related assumptions regarding vse s future taxable income change in the future  vse may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets  resulting in additional income tax expense

   business units inactive as of december  
  revenues increased by approximately and for the years ended december  and december   as compared to the respective prior years 
the primary reasons for the increases in revenues in were work attributable to the tbps program  increased levels of work performed by fmd on its us navy contracts  an increase in work performed under the bav ship transfer program  including revenues associated with the taiwan ship transfer  an increase in work performed on the ced rapid response contract  and increased levels of military equipment refurbishment services performed by sed for the us army reserve 
the primary reasons for the increase in revenues in were an increase in work performed under the bav contract  including increased revenues associated with the taiwan ship transfer  the ced rapid response contract received work orders that generated revenues throughout the full year in  as compared to the prior year when the contract was awarded in february of and did not begin to receive any significant amount of work until september  and increased levels of work performed by fmd due in part to the navy s elevated readiness requirements 
work requirements and revenues also increased in sed  msd and vcg

income from continuing operations before income taxes 





   vse s gross profit margin on continuing operations increased in as compared to and remained substantially unchanged during as compared to company wide revenue increases tend to increase the gross margins realized on the company s fixed price and time and materials contracts due to the ability to spread corporate costs over a larger revenue base 
the increase in gross margins in was primarily attributable to spreading corporate fixed costs over a larger revenue base and an increase in the percentage of work performed on fixed price and time and materials contracts  which have more favorable profit margins than work performed on cost type contracts 
the tbps program and increased military equipment refurbishment services performed by sed for the us army reserve increased both the company s overall revenue and percentage of fixed price and time and materials contract work  and made the most significant contributions to increased gross margins 
another reason for the improved gross margins is the reduction of operational losses associated with ced in as compared to and other factors that affect the company s gross margins include the timing of contract award fees  effective project and cost management  and competitive factors 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs and expenses that are not chargeable or reimbursable on the company s operating unit contracts 
as a percentage of revenues  these expenses varied little in and as compared to the respective prior years 
vse did not have significant borrowing requirements or interest expense in   and the company s interest income increased in as compared to and increased in as compared to as profits from operations and resulting cash surpluses were invested 
discontinued operations in july  all business operations associated with the company s ttd division ceased 
accordingly  prior period consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the financial results of ttd as discontinued operations 
the revenues  costs and expenses of ttd have been excluded from the respective captions in the consolidated statement of operations 
the loss from discontinued operations associated with ttd  net of tax  in the years ended december    and was approximately  thousand and  thousand  respectively 
financial condition vse s financial condition remained strong during the company s largest assets are its accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents 
the largest liabilities are its accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts receivable increased approximately million  accounts payable increased approximately million  and accrued expenses increased approximately million during due primarily to the increase in the level of business activity and the associated billings to customers and payments to subcontractors required to perform this work 
cash and cash equivalents increased approximately million due to the timing of customer billings and collections  the timing of subcontractor and vendor billings and payments  and to profits 
inventories declined approximately million during as initial quantities of materials and supplies purchased for the tbps program were used to complete protection systems for vehicles 
the change in total stockholders investment in this period resulted from earnings and dividend activity and from the exercise of stock options 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million during approximately million in net cash was provided by operating activities  approximately million was used in investing activities  and approximately million was used in financing activities 
the difference between cash provided by operating activities of approximately million in as compared to cash used in operating activities of approximately million in is primarily due to differences in the levels of accounts receivable  contract inventories  and accounts payable associated with contract requirements and the associated billing and collections cycle  and to the company s increase in profits 
investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities consisted of million used to repay bank loans  thousand provided by the issuance of common stock to directors and officers associated with the exercise of stock options and directors fees  and thousand used to pay dividends 
the company s cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately million during approximately million in net cash was used in operating activities  investing activities used approximately million  and financing activities provided approximately million 
the difference between cash used in operating activities of approximately million in as compared to cash provided by operating activities of approximately million in is primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and contract inventories associated with contract requirements for significant material and subcontractor usage for which the billing and collections cycle had not been completed 
the accounts receivable and contract inventories increases were partially offset by increases in net income and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities consisted of million provided by bank loan proceeds  thousand provided by the issuance of common stock to directors and officers associated with the exercise of stock options and directors fees  and thousand used to pay dividends 
the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million during approximately million in net cash was provided by operating activities  investing activities used approximately thousand  and financing activities used approximately thousand 
investing activities consisted of the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities consisted of thousand used to pay dividends and thousand provided by the issuance of common stock to directors and officers associated with the exercise of stock options and directors fees 
quarterly cash dividends were paid at the rate of 
per share during the three month periods ended march and june   and at the rate of 
per share during the three month periods ended september and december  pursuant to its bank loan agreement see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the payment of cash dividends by vse is subject to annual rate restrictions 
vse has paid cash dividends each year since liquidity the company s internal sources of liquidity result primarily from operating activities  specifically from changes in the level of revenues and associated accounts receivable and accounts payable from period to period  and from profitability 
significant increases or decreases in revenue and accounts receivable and accounts payable can cause significant increases or decreases in internal liquidity 
accounts receivable arise primarily from billings made by the company to the government or other government prime contractors for services rendered  and payments received on accounts receivable represent the principal source of cash for the company 
accounts receivable levels can be affected significantly by the timing of large materials purchases and subcontractor efforts used in performance on the company s contracts 
accounts receivable levels are also affected by contract retainages  differences between the provisional billing rates authorized by the government compared to the costs actually incurred by the company  and government delays in processing administrative paperwork for contract funding 
work on the tbps program requires the company to acquire inventories consisting of materials  supplies  and other expenditures for which end units have not yet been completed and accepted 
although these costs are classified as inventories for accounting purposes  they are similar in nature to materials and direct supplies purchased for use in performance on the company s other contracts in that they are solely and directly attributable to the contract and will be billed to the customer within a relatively short time 
all of the inventories are expected to be liquidated  billed  and collected as vehicle protection systems are completed and accepted by the government customer 
these materials and direct supplies will not be restocked to maintain any permanent inventory levels 
accounts payable arise primarily from purchases of subcontractor services and materials used by the company in the performance of its contract work 
payments made on accounts payable  along with payments made to satisfy employee payroll and payroll associated expenses  make up the principal cash requirements of the company 
accounts payable levels can be affected by changes in the level of contract work performed by the company and by the timing of large materials purchases and subcontractor efforts used in performance on the company s contracts 
other cash requirements include income tax payments  the acquisition of capital assets for shop  office and computer support  and the payment of cash dividends 
from time to time  the company also invests in the expansion  improvement  and maintenance of its operational and administrative facilities 
the company expects to make approximately thousand in such facilities investments and additional acquisitions of shop equipment in to support expected increases in the level of military equipment refurbishment efforts 
vse s external sources of liquidity consist of a revolving bank loan agreement that provides loan financing based on the company s accounts receivable see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the bank financing complements the internal sources of liquidity by providing increasing levels of borrowing capacity as accounts receivable levels increase 
the bank loan agreement provided loan financing up to a maximum commitment of million as of december  the amount of this commitment is negotiable between the company and the bank 
the company has determined that the current million commitment amount is adequate to cover known current and future liquidity requirements 
performance of work under the company s larger contracts that require significant amounts of subcontractor or material purchases have the potential to cause substantial requirements for working capital  however  management believes that cash flows from operations and the bank loan commitment are adequate to meet current operating cash requirements 
contractual obligations the following table shows the consolidated contractual obligations for vse as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases  net of non cancelable sublease income 







   purchase obligations 

total    operating lease commitments are primarily for vse s principal executive and administrative offices and leased facilities for office  shop  and warehouse space located near customer sites 
the company also has some equipment and software leases that are included in these amounts 
in january  the company signed an additional five year facility lease for shop  office and warehouse space to begin in april for an aggregate amount of thousand 
purchase obligations consist primarily of contractual commitments associated with construction  improvements and maintenance on vse facilities  and for the acquisition of office  shop  and computer equipment 
the table excludes contractual commitments for materials or subcontractor work purchased to perform us government contracts 
such commitments for materials and subcontractors are reimbursable when used on the contracts  and generally are also reimbursable in the event a contract is terminated for convenience by the us government pursuant to federal contracting regulations 
inflation and pricing most of the contracts performed by vse provide for estimates of future labor costs to be escalated for any option periods provided by the contracts  while the non labor costs included in such contracts are normally considered reimbursable at cost 
vse property and equipment consists principally of computer systems equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the overall impact of inflation on replacement costs of such property and equipment is not expected to be significant 
disclosures about market risk interest rates vse s bank loan financing provides available borrowing to the company at variable interest rates 
the company has not borrowed significant amounts on the loan in recent years 
accordingly  the company does not believe that any movement in interest rates would have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows 
if vse were to significantly increase borrowings on the current loan arrangement  or enter into other loan arrangements  future interest rate changes could potentially have a material impact 
foreign currency while a significant amount of the company s business results from the services provided by bav related to the transfer of ships to foreign governments  the bav contract payments are made by the us government in us dollars 
additionally  most funding requirements to support work performed or services purchased in foreign countries are made in us dollars  and the infrequent disbursements that are made in foreign currencies are reimbursable to bav in post conversion dollars 
foreign currency transactions of other vse divisions or subsidiaries are virtually non existent 
accordingly  the company does not believe that it is exposed to any material foreign currency
