item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer  which we refer to as recurring revenue contracts or long term contracts 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage with additional charges applicable for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
having a consistent and predictable base level of income is important to our financial success 
accordingly  to be successful  we must maintain our base of recurring revenue contracts by eliminating or reducing lost monthly recurring revenue due to customer cancellations or terminations and build on that base by adding new customers and increasing the number of services  features and functions our customers purchase 
at the same time  we must ensure that our expenses do not increase faster than  or at the same rate as  our revenues 
accomplishing these goals requires that we compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price  quality and the attractiveness of our services and technology 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
see risk factors elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of certain risks associated with our business 
our improved financial results in as compared to and reflect our efforts to increase our monthly recurring revenues while reducing the expenses needed to support such growth 
the following sets forth  as a percentage of revenues  consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated revenues cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of other intangible assets restructuring benefits total costs and operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other expense income  net loss gain on investments  net loss on early extinguishment of debt income loss before benefit provision for income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss we were profitable for fiscal years and  however  we cannot guarantee continued profitability for any period in the future 
we have observed the following trends and events that are likely to have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the foreseeable future during each quarter in and  the dollar volume of new recurring revenue contracts exceeded the dollar volume of the contracts we lost through cancellations  terminations and non payment 
a continuation of this trend would lead to increased revenues in the future 
during  no customer accounted for or more of our total revenues 
we expect that customer concentration levels will decline compared to prior years as our customer base continues to grow 

table of contents during  revenues derived from customers located outside the united states were of our total revenues 
we expect that the revenues from such customers as a percentage of our total revenues in will be consistent with that of during  we continued to reduce our network bandwidth costs per unit by entering into new supplier contracts with lower pricing and amending existing contracts to take advantage of price reductions offered by our existing suppliers 
however  due to increased traffic delivered over our network  our total bandwidth costs increased during we believe that our overall bandwidth costs will continue to increase as a result of expected higher traffic levels  partially offset by continued reductions in bandwidth costs per unit 
if we do not experience lower per unit bandwidth pricing and we are unsuccessful at effectively routing traffic over our network through lower cost providers  network bandwidth costs could increase in excess of our expectations in depreciation expense related to our network equipment increased in as compared to due to additional equipment purchases in  expected additional purchases in  as well as equipment acquired with the acquisition of speedera  we believe that depreciation expense related to our network equipment will continue to increase in we expect to continue to enhance and add functionality to our service offerings  which will increase the amount of capitalized internal use software costs 
as a result  we believe that the amortization of internal use software development costs  which we include in cost of revenues  will slightly increase in equity based compensation expense increased during as compared to in connection with the acquisition of speedera and the issuance of deferred stock units to members of our board of directors in statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment revised  which will be applicable to us beginning in the first quarter of  will require us to record compensation expense for employee equity awards at fair value at the time of grant 
we anticipate a further increase in our non cash equity based compensation expense  likely resulting in a significant decrease in our expected net income in the future  because we have a significant number of unvested employee options outstanding and plan to continue to grant equity based compensation in the future 
during  we released substantially all of our united states and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
based upon our cumulative operating results and an assessment of our expected future results  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
during  the total valuation allowance release recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations was million 
we expect our annualized effective tax rate in the future to significantly increase 
we expect that our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in will be approximately 
based on our analysis of these known trends and events  we expect to continue to generate net income on a quarterly basis during  however  our future results will be affected by many factors identified below and in the section of this report entitled risk factors  including our ability to increase our revenue by adding customers through long term contracts and limiting customer cancellations and terminations  maintain the prices we charge for our services  prevent disruptions to our services and network due to accidents or intentional attacks  and maintain our network bandwidth costs and other operating expenses consistent with our revenues 
as a result  there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives  including positive net income 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates overview our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable reserves  capitalized internal use software costs  intangible assets and goodwill  income and other taxes  useful lives of property and equipment  restructuring accruals and contingent obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
definitions we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make subjective estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and applied and require us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes 
review of critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize service revenues in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the inception of a customer contract for service  we make an estimate as to that customer s ability to pay for the services provided 
we base our estimate on a combination of factors  including the successful completion of a credit check or financial review  our payment history with the customer and other forms of payment assurance 
upon the completion of these steps  we recognize revenue monthly in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
if we subsequently determine that collection from the customer is not reasonably assured  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense for all of that customer s unpaid invoices and cease recognizing revenue for continued services provided until cash is received 
changes in our estimates and judgments about whether collection is reasonably assured would change the timing of revenue or amount of bad debt expense that we recognize 
we primarily derive income from the sale of services to customers executing contracts with terms of one year or longer 
these contracts generally commit the customer to a minimum monthly level of usage and provide the rate at which the customer must pay for actual usage above the monthly minimum 
for these services  we recognize the monthly minimum as revenue each month provided that an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the service has been delivered to the customer  the fee for the service is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
should a customer s usage of our service exceed the monthly minimum  we recognize revenue for such excess usage in the period of the usage 
we typically charge the customer an installation fee when the services are first activated 
the installation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated life of the customer arrangement 
we also derive income from services sold as discrete  non recurring events or based solely on usage 
for these services  we recognize revenue after an enforceable contract has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  the event or usage has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
we periodically enter into multi element service arrangements 
when we enter into such arrangements  each element is accounted for separately over its respective service period  provided that there is objective evidence of fair value for the separate elements 
for example  objective evidence of fair value would include the price charged for the element when sold separately 
if the fair value of each element cannot be objectively determined  the total value of the arrangement is recognized ratably over the entire service period to the extent that all services have begun to be provided at the outset of the period 
for most multi element service arrangements to date  the fair value 
table of contents of each element has not been objectively determinable 
therefore  all revenue under these arrangements has been recognized ratably over the related service period 
we also license software under perpetual and term license agreements 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modifications of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
as prescribed by this guidance  we apply the residual method of accounting 
the residual method requires that the portion of the total arrangement fee attributable to undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  is deferred and subsequently recognized when delivered 
the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements  if all other revenue recognition criteria of sop are met 
we also sell our services through a reseller channel 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize revenue from reseller arrangements based on the reseller s contracted non refundable minimum purchase commitments over the term of the contract  plus amounts sold by the reseller to its customers in excess of the minimum commitments 
these excess commitments are recognized as revenue in the period in which the service is provided 
we recognize revenue from fixed fee arrangements and software arrangements that require significant customization or modification using the percentage of completion method in accordance with accounting research bulletin  or arb  no 
 long term construction type contracts  and with the applicable guidance provided by sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we generally recognize revenue under these arrangements based on the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost to complete the project 
in certain customer arrangements  we recognize revenue based on the progress made towards achieving milestones under the contract 
the impact of any change in estimate is recorded prospectively from the date of the change 
at the outset of a fixed fee arrangement  if we are not able to estimate the total cost to complete  nor able to measure progress towards the achievement of contract milestones  we account for the arrangement using the completed contract method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize revenue when the contract is complete and there are no remaining costs or deliverables 
in the event that the estimated total cost on a fixed fee contract indicates a loss  we will record the loss immediately 
from time to time  we enter into contracts to sell our services or license our technology to unrelated companies at or about the same time we enter into contracts to purchase products or services from the same companies 
if we conclude that these contracts were negotiated concurrently  we record as revenue only the net cash received from the vendor  unless both the fair values of our services delivered to the customer and of the vendor s product or service we receive can be established objectively and realization of such value is believed to be probable 
we may from time to time resell licenses or services of third parties 
we record revenue for these transactions when we have risk of loss related to the amounts purchased from the third party and we add value to the license or service  such as by providing maintenance or support for such license or service 
if these conditions are present  we recognize revenue when all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly billed service fees  deferred installation and activation set up fees  amounts billed under extended payment terms  and maintenance and support fees charged under license arrangements 
accounts receivable and related reserves trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
in addition to trade accounts receivable  our accounts receivable balance includes unbilled accounts that represent revenue recorded for customers that is typically billed within one month 
we record reserves against our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves consist of allowances for doubtful accounts  cash basis customers and service credits 
increases and decreases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as a component of general and administrative expenses 
the reserve for cash basis customers increases as services are provided to customers where collection is no longer assured 
the reserve decreases and revenue is recognized when and if cash payments are received 
the 
table of contents reserve for service credits increases as a result of specific service credits that are expected to be issued to customers during the ordinary course of business  as well as for billing disputes 
these credits result in a reduction to revenues 
decreases to the reserve are the result of actual credits being issued to customers  causing a corresponding reduction in accounts receivable 
estimates are used in determining these reserves and are based upon our review of outstanding balances on a customer specific  account by account basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon a review of customer receivables from prior sales with collection issues where we no longer believe that the customer has the ability to pay for prior services provided 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers 
if such an evaluation indicates that payment is no longer reasonably assured for current services provided  any future services provided to that customer will result in creation of a reserve until we receive consistent payments 
in addition  we reserve a portion of revenues as a reserve for service credits 
reserves for service credits are measured based on an analysis of revenue credits to be issued after the month of billing and an estimate for future credits 
these credits typically relate to management s estimate of the resolution of customer disputes and billing adjustments 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
impairment and useful lives of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
events that would trigger an impairment review include a change in the use of the asset or forecasted negative cash flows related to the asset 
when such a triggering event occurs  we compare the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows related to the asset 
if the carrying amount is greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  we adjust the asset to its fair value through an impairment charge included in loss from operations 
we determine fair value based upon a quoted market price or a discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimates required to apply this accounting policy include forecasted usage of the long lived assets and the useful lives of these assets and expected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could materially impact results from operations 
restructuring liabilities related to facility leases when we vacate a facility subject to a non cancelable long term lease  we record a restructuring liability for either the estimated costs to terminate the lease or the estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term where there is no economic benefit to us 
in the latter case  we measure the amount of the restructuring liability as the amount of contractual future lease payments reduced by an estimate of sublease income 
to date  we have recorded a restructuring liability when our management approves and commits us to a plan to terminate a lease  the plan specifically identifies the actions to be taken  and the actions are scheduled to begin soon after management approves the plan 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we record restructuring liabilities  discounted at the appropriate rate  for a facility lease only when we have both vacated the space and completed all actions needed to make the space readily available for sublease 
as of december   we had million in accrued restructuring liabilities related to vacated facilities 
in  we were able to renegotiate two of our previously restructured facility leases to reduce rents payable under the leases to current market rates  resulting in a reversal of previously recorded restructuring liabilities of million 
we expect that approximately million of the amount accrued as of december  will be paid within months 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the 
table of contents likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
tax reserves our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion 
the current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
the deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
management weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
in the third quarter of  management determined it was more likely than not that most of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
this decision was based on our cumulative history of book earnings over a quarter period and on projections of expected future taxable income 
the tax assets estimated to be realized in future periods have been calculated by applying a blended federal and state tax rate of  which is based upon the tax rates expected to be in effect in the periods during which the attributes are expected to be utilized 
changes in this blended rate in future periods could have a material effect on both the tax provision in the period of change as well as the net deferred tax asset carrying value 
we have recorded tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions 
our determination of the amount of these tax reserves involves assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the cost of the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we estimated 
accounting for stock options historically  through december   we recognized stock option costs pursuant to accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we have disclosed the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
effective in  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
both sfas no 
and r require management to make assumptions to determine the fair value of stock options  including the expected life of the stock options and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
changes to the assumptions may have a significant impact on the fair value of the stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
additionally  in our pro forma disclosure  we incorporate a forfeiture estimate as we recognize equity expense 
should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  this could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
capitalized internal use software costs we capitalize the salaries and payroll related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of internal use software projects 
if a project constitutes an enhancement to previously developed software  we assess whether the enhancement is significant and creates additional functionality to the software  thus qualifying the work incurred for capitalization 
once the project is complete  we estimate the useful life of the internal use software  and we periodically assess whether the software is impaired 
changes in our estimates related to internal use software would increase or decrease operating expenses or amortization recorded during the period 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  total revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in total revenues for as compared to was attributable to an 
table of contents increase in service revenue of million  partially offset by a reduction in software and software related revenue of million 
the increase in total revenues for as compared to was attributable to an increase in service revenue of million  partially offset by a reduction in software and software related revenue of  and related party revenue of  service revenue  which consists of revenue from our content and application delivery services  increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  service revenue was million for the year ended december  the increases in service revenue were primarily attributable to increases in the number of customers under recurring revenue contracts  as well as increases in traffic and additional services sold to new and existing customers and increases in the average revenue per customer 
these increases are attributable to greater market acceptance of our services among new customers and improvements in our ability to sell additional features to our existing customers 
also contributing to the increases in service revenue were revenues generated from the acquisition of speedera on june  as of december   we had  customers under recurring revenue contracts as compared to  as of december   and  as of december  for and  and  respectively  of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which and of overall revenues  respectively  was derived from operations in europe 
for  of our total revenues was derived from our operations located outside of the united states  of which of overall revenues was derived from operations in europe 
no single country accounted for or more of revenues derived outside of the united states during these periods 
resellers accounted for of revenues in  in and in for  no single customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
for and  microsoft corporation accounted for and  respectively  of total revenues 
software and software related revenue decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  software and software related revenue was million for the year ended december  software and software related revenue includes sales of customized software projects and technology licensing 
the decreases in software and software related revenue over the periods presented reflect a reduction in the number of customized software projects that we undertook for customers and a decrease in the number of software licenses executed with customers 
we do not expect software and software related revenue to increase as a percentage of revenues in we had no revenue from related parties during and service and software revenue from related parties was  for the year ended december  related party revenue in represented revenue from akamai australia  a joint venture with es group ventures pty ltd  relating to resale commitments 
in june  this joint venture was terminated 
we do not expect to have any revenue from related parties in cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes fees paid to network providers for bandwidth and co location of our network equipment 
cost of revenues also includes payroll and related costs and equity related compensation for network operations personnel  cost of software licenses  depreciation of network equipment used to deliver our services and amortization of internal use software 
cost of revenues increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenues for as compared to was primarily due to an increase in aggregate bandwidth costs due to higher traffic levels and an increase in depreciation expense of network equipment as we continue to invest in our infrastructure  partially offset by reduced bandwidth costs per unit 
the total cost of revenues decreased in as compared to as a result of a decline in depreciation expense of network equipment as the impact of our network assets becoming fully depreciated exceeded the depreciation from the investments we made in our network infrastructure 
the decline in deprecation expense in was partially offset by an increase in total bandwidth costs due to an increase in the amount of traffic delivered 
cost of revenues during  and also included credits of million  million and million  respectively  as a result of settlements and renegotiations entered into in connection with billing 
table of contents disputes related to bandwidth contracts 
credits of this nature may occur in the future  however  the timing and amount of future credits  if any  will vary 
cost of revenues is comprised of the following in millions for the year ended december  bandwidth  co location and storage fees payroll and related costs of network operations personnel  including equity related compensation cost of software licenses depreciation and impairment of network equipment and amortization of internal use software total cost of revenues we have long term purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and co location with various networks and internet service providers 
for the years ending december   and  the minimum commitments related to bandwidth usage and co location services are approximately million  million and  respectively 
we believe cost of revenues will increase in we expect to deliver more traffic on our network  which would result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic  however  such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit 
additionally  we expect increases in depreciation expense related to our network equipment and amortization of internal use software development costs  as well as an increase in payroll and payroll related costs  as we continue to make investments in our network to service our expanding customer base 
additionally  with the impact of implementing sfas no 
r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of  we expect significant increases in cost of revenues attributable to equity related compensation expense 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs and equity related compensation for research and development personnel who design  develop  test and enhance our services and our network 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred  except certain software development costs requiring capitalization 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  consisting of external consulting and payroll and payroll related costs related to the development of internal use software used to deliver our services and operate our network 
these capitalized internal use software costs are amortized to cost of revenues over their estimated useful lives of two years 
research and development expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in as compared to was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs due to an increase in headcount 
the decrease in as compared to was primarily due to decreases in payroll and related costs  including equity related compensation  as a reflection of the impact of workforce reductions in prior years and a reduction in equity compensation as stock awards became fully vested 
the following table quantifies the net changes in research and development expenses over periods presented in millions increase decrease in research and development expenses to to payroll and related costs  including equity related compensation capitalization of internal use software development costs and other total increase decrease 
table of contents we believe that research and development expenses will increase in  as we continue to increase hiring of development personnel and make investments in our core technology and refinements to our other service offerings 
additionally  with the impact of implementing sfas no 
r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of  we expect significant increases in research and development expense attributable to equity related compensation expense 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs  equity related compensation and commissions for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and service support functions  as well as advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses during these periods was primarily due to higher payroll and related costs  particularly commissions  for sales and marketing personnel due to revenue growth 
additionally  marketing and related costs increased in due to higher advertising and promotional costs as compared to the following table quantifies the net increase in sales and marketing expenses for the periods presented in millions increase in sales and marketing expenses to to payroll and related costs  including equity related compensation marketing and related costs other expense total net increase we believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in due to an expected increase in commissions on higher forecasted sales  the expected increase in hiring of sales and marketing personnel and additional expected increases in marketing costs such as advertising 
additionally  with the impact of implementing sfas no 
r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of  we expect significant increases in sales and marketing expenses attributable to equity related compensation expense 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the following components payroll and related costs  including equity related compensation and related expenses for executive  finance  business applications  network management  human resources and other administrative personnel  depreciation of property and equipment used by us internally  fees for professional services  non income related taxes  insurance costs  the provision for doubtful accounts  and rent and other facility related expenditures for leased properties 
general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses during was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related costs as a result of headcount growth  as well as an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts 
this increase was offset by a reduction in legal and consulting costs associated with the dismissal of the lawsuits between akamai and speedera as a result of our 
table of contents acquisition of speedera 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses during was primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated  a reduction in payroll and related costs  including equity compensation  as a result of equity awards becoming fully vested and reduced rent expense due to lease restructurings in prior years 
during and  consulting and advisory services increased significantly compared to those in as a result of the costs associated with the evaluation of our internal controls in order to allow management to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  our internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of the following table quantifies the net change in general and administrative expenses for the periods presented in millions increase decrease in general and administrative expenses to to payroll and related costs  including equity related compensation rent and facilities depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts consulting and advisory services other expenses total net increase decrease during the years ended december  and  we capitalized software development costs of  and  respectively  consisting of external consulting fees and payroll and payroll related costs associated with the development of internally used software applications 
once the projects are completed  such costs will be amortized and included in general and administrative expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in due to increased payroll and related costs attributable to increased hiring  an increase in non income tax expense and an increase in rent and facilities costs as we expanded our leasing of office space in these increases will be offset by an expected reduction in legal costs 
additionally  with the impact of implementing sfas no 
r for the expensing of employee stock awards at fair value beginning in the first quarter of  we expect significant increases in general and administrative expenses attributable to equity related compensation expense 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations and amortization of acquired license rights 
amortization of other intangible assets increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  amortization of other intangible assets for the year ended december  was million 
the increase in amortization of other intangible assets in was due to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisition of speedera in june intangible assets acquired in prior acquisitions were fully amortized in the first quarter of  consequently  there was no corresponding amortization of such assets in we expect to amortize approximately million  million  million  million and million for fiscal years    and  respectively  in connection with the speedera acquisition 
restructuring benefits charges 
we did not record any restructuring charges or benefits during or during the year ended december   we recorded net restructuring benefits of million as a result of amendments to certain real estate leases 
during the year ended december   we amended or terminated three long term leases in connection with which we paid our lessors a total of million in cash and restricted cash 
as a result of these amendments to  or terminations of  long term leases  we reversed million of previously recorded restructuring liabilities  offset by a restructuring charge of million for costs relating to the restructuring of a facility located in europe 
the reversals represent the difference between the previously estimated restructuring liabilities and the amounts payable under negotiated agreements for certain leased properties with the landlords thereof 
we estimate the amount of restructuring liabilities associated with real estate leases based on the most recent available market data and discussions with our lessors and real estate advisors 

table of contents we do not anticipate significant restructuring charges in the future  however  we will continue to pursue modifications or settlements on our long term leases if we believe it to be in our best interest 
interest income 
interest income includes interest earned on invested cash balances and marketable securities 
interest income increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest income increased  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income in and as compared to previous years was due to an increase in our invested marketable securities period over period as we generated more cash from operations and invested the proceeds from the issuance of our convertible senior notes 
in and  we also experienced an increase in interest rates earned on our investments 
in november  we received proceeds of million from our public equity offering of million shares of our common stock  accordingly  we expect interest income to increase in interest expense 
interest expense includes interest paid on our debt obligations as well as amortization of deferred financing costs 
interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease during each of these periods was due to lower interest expense as a result of redemptions and repurchases of our convertible subordinated notes at various times between december and september  offset by interest payable on our convertible senior notes issued in december and january during and  we redeemed or repurchased million and million  respectively  in aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes 
as a result of these transactions  we believe that interest expense on our debt obligations  including deferred financing amortization  will not exceed million in other expense income  net 
other net expense represents foreign exchange gains and losses incurred during the periods presented  as well as gains and losses on legal settlements 
other net expense increased  or million  to  for the year ended december  as compared to other net income of million for the year ended december  other net income increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to other net expense of  for the year ended december  other net expense for the year ended december  represented million of foreign exchange losses  offset by million of net gains on legal settlements 
other net income of million for the year ended december  represented approximately  of gains on legal settlements and  of foreign exchange gains 
for the year ended december   other net expense of  consisted of foreign exchange losses 
other net expense income may fluctuate in the future based upon the movement in foreign exchange rates 
loss gain on investments  net 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded a net loss on investments of  and  respectively  on the sale of marketable securities 
during  we recorded a net gain of million  of which million related to the sale of equity investments in publicly traded companies  offset by losses of  on investments in privately held companies and sales of marketable securities 
we do not expect significant gains or losses on investments in  as we no longer hold any substantial investments in publicly or privately held companies 
loss on early extinguishment of debt 
loss on early extinguishment of debt decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  loss on early extinguishment of debt increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in loss on early extinguishment of debt in is due to costs incurred in connection with our redemption of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes during this loss of million consists of  in premiums above par value paid to redeem such notes and  of deferred financing costs associated with redeeming the notes prior to their maturity 
during and  we repurchased million and million  respectively  in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes which resulted in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million and million  respectively 

table of contents benefit provision for income taxes 
benefit for income taxes increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to a provision for income taxes of  during the year ended december  provision for income taxes increased  or  to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  during  in connection with the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance  we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
the provision for income taxes for each of and was primarily related to our alternative minimum tax payment obligations and income earned in foreign jurisdictions where we were profitable 
as of june   our united states and foreign net operating losses  or nols  and other deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance primarily because at the time  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we did not have sufficient history of taxable income to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the tax benefits of those deferred tax assets 
based upon our cumulative history of earnings over a quarter period and an assessment of our expected future results of operations  during the third quarter of  we determined that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize a substantial portion of our united states and foreign nol carryforward tax assets prior to their expiration and other deferred tax assets 
as a result  during the third quarter of  we released a total of million of our united states and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
of the million  million of the valuation release was recorded as an income tax benefit in our statement of operations  million of the valuation release was attributable to stock option exercises  which was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital on the balance sheet  and approximately million of the valuation release was recorded as a reduction to acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
as of september   we had a remaining valuation allowance of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company released the remainder of the valuation allowance  except for million that we will maintain because the realization of certain deferred tax assets does not meet the more likely than not criterion under sfas no 
this portion of the valuation allowance primarily relates to certain state nols with a five year carryover period that  as of december   we expect will expire unused 
the fourth quarter valuation allowance release is consistent with the requirement under apb no 
interim financial reporting  that we use an annualized effective tax rate for each interim period during the year  including current year interim periods  after a valuation allowance release has occurred 
the total valuation allowance release recorded as an income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for was million 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  remained relatively low before considering the deferred tax valuation allowance release as discussed above  however  our annualized effective tax rate in future periods after is expected to significantly increase 
we expect that our consolidated annualized effective tax rate in will be approximately 
because of the availability of the nols discussed above  a significant portion of our future provision for income taxes is expected to be a non cash expense  consequently  the amount of cash paid with respect to income taxes is expected to be a relatively small portion of the total annualized tax expense during periods in which the nols are utilized 
in determining our net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  and projections of our future provision for income taxes  annualized effective tax rates  and cash paid for income taxes  management is required to make judgments and estimates about domestic and foreign profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of nol carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
judgments and estimates related to our projections and assumptions are inherently uncertain  therefore  actual results could differ materially from our projections 
we have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our sales and use and franchise tax positions 
these potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations by different jurisdictions 
our estimate of the value of these tax reserves reflects assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have estimated 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the following transactions private sales of capital stock and subordinated notes  which were repaid in  an initial public offering of our common stock in october that provided million after underwriters discounts and commissions  the sale in june of an aggregate of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes  which were retired in full between december and september  which generated net proceeds of million  the sale in december and january of an aggregate million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes  which generated net proceeds of million  the public offering of million shares of our common stock in november  which generated net proceeds of million  and cash generated by operations 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  of which million is subject to restrictions limiting our ability to withdraw or otherwise use such cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
see letters of credit below 
cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities for each of and as compared to previous years was primarily due to increased service revenue and increases in deferred revenue 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities will continue to increase as a result of an upward trend in cash collections related to higher revenues  partially offset by an expected increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries in connection with expected increases in headcount 
the timing and amount of future working capital changes and our ability to manage our days sales outstanding will also affect the future amount of cash used in or provided by operating activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities for reflects net purchases of marketable securities of million primarily related to the cash received from our equity financing in november additionally  cash used in investing activities for includes capital expenditures of million  consisting of the capitalization of the purchase of network infrastructure equipment and internal use software development costs related to our current and future service offerings 
these investments were offset by million of cash acquired through the speedera acquisition and a decrease of  in restricted investments previously held for security deposits 
cash provided by investing activities for reflects proceeds from net sales and maturities of investments of million  offset by capital expenditures of million 
during  cash provided by investing activities also included a decrease of million in restricted cash to reflect our repurchase of million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in early and a decrease of  in restricted investments previously held for security deposits 
cash used in investing activities for reflects net purchases of investments of million  an increase in restricted cash to reflect a commitment to repurchase million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in early and capital expenditures of million 
for  we expect total capital expenditures  a component of cash used in investing activities  to be approximately the same percentage of revenues as cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in reflects net proceeds from our november equity offering of million and 
table of contents proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of million  offset by payments made to redeem million in principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes and payments on capital lease obligations of  cash used in financing activities in reflects payments for the repurchase of approximately million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes and payments on our capital leases of  offset by net proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible senior notes of million and proceeds from issuances of common stock under our equity compensation plans of million

changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are dependent upon changes in working capital items such as deferred revenue  accounts payable  accounts receivable and various accrued expenses  as well as changes in our capital and financial structure  including debt repurchases and issuances  stock option exercises  sales of equity investments and similar events 
the following table represents the net inflows and outflows of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for the periods presented in millions for the year ended december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of december  and  respectively changes in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities receipts from customers payments to vendors payments for employee payroll debt repurchases debt proceeds debt interest and premium payments stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan issuances equity offering proceeds cash acquired in business acquisition other net increase decrease cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of december  and  respectively we believe  based on our current business plan  that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and forecasted cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures and restructuring expenses for at least the next months 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenue and expenses change or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those accruing to holders of common stock  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would also result in additional dilution to our stockholders
