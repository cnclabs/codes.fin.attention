item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this md a section discusses our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition  risk management practices and certain factors that may affect our future results  including economic and industry wide factors  as well as our critical accounting policies and estimates 
our md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  as well as the risk factors set forth in item a  included in this annual report on form k 
retrospective application of new accounting pronouncement on october   the fasb issued fsp fas  which requires that rental costs incurred during the construction period of new stores  be charged to rental expense as a period cost 
our practice had been to capitalize such rents as part of the cost of the asset and amortize them over the asset s estimated useful life 
we have elected early adoption and have chosen to retrospectively apply fsp fas to prior years financial statements for enhanced comparability with peers and consistency of internal treatment for all properties 
the retrospective application includes adjustments to cost of sales  buying and store occupancy costs  income loss before income taxes  provision benefit for income taxes  net income loss and earnings loss per share 
item  selected financial data and management s discussion and analysis gives effect to these adjustments 
for additional information with respect to these adjustments  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements executive overview bombay markets a line of proprietary home furnishings that includes large furniture  occasional furniture  wall decor and decorative accessories that is timeless and classic in its styling 
over of the items are sourced from approximately countries worldwide  with slightly more than half of the product coming from china 
we are a multi channel retailer with store locations  internet and mail order operations 
we continue to have a small wholesale operation that is immaterial to overall revenue but contributes incrementally to profitability 
we focus on several key metrics in managing and evaluating our operating performance and financial condition including the following same store sales  sales and gross margins  operating margins as a percentage of revenue  cash flow  and inventory 
we are currently executing a multi phase turnaround intended to improve bombay s long term profitability and generate competitive operating results in line with current market leaders in the sector whose operating profits are in the to range 
during the course of the turnaround  we have focused on a number of strategies to position the company to achieve these goals including repositioning the real estate portfolio by moving from high cost mall to lower cost off mall locations  upgrading the merchandise assortment from both a quality and a pricing standpoint  attracting new customers and ensuring the we have the appropriate infrastructure in place to ensure that we can meet these goals 
our recent focus has included or is expected to include the following migrating from mall to off mall during the s and s  the focus was on opening stores in a malls throughout north america 
as shopping habits have evolved  with alternative venues such as lifestyle centers and big box strip centers gaining popularity  we began to migrate our stores to off mall locations 
management continues to be encouraged by the results of its store migration 
in addition to being more convenient for customers and suitable for the sale of large items  such locations typically have lower cost structures  both from a fixed rent perspective and for other common area expenses billed by landlords 
off mall stores have consistently delivered four wall profits that are to basis points higher than the mall based stores while maintaining or growing the average sales volumes of the mall stores that they replaced 
the company expects to continue to execute its strategy of exiting mall locations at the end of the lease when a desirable off mall location can be identified 
as of the end of the year  the company had off mall core stores and mall based core stores 
including bombaykids stores  the company has a total of mall stores and off mall stores as of the end of fiscal the following table reflects the real estate portfolio at each fiscal year end january  january  january  units of total units of total units of total mall off mall outlet total rationalizing the real estate portfolio during fiscal  we conducted a comprehensive review of our stores and identified a total of approximately unprofitable stores targeted for closure in fiscal we expect to close an additional to stores during the year as leases expire  with to stores being replaced by new off mall locations 
we will continue to assess closing opportunities and presently expect to end the year with approximately to stores of which approximately will be in mall locations  will be in off mall locations and will be outlets 
upgrading the assortment during late fiscal and fiscal  we focused on upgrading our assortment increasing quality and price points to further differentiate our offering from that of the mass merchants and other specialty retailers 
as a result of these efforts  we have successfully increased our average transaction size by and also increased the size of our average unit retail 
we also believe that we have made strides in improving the quality of our merchandise and have been able to offer a more fashion right assortment to our customers 
we will continue to make this a priority in fiscal as we seek to attract a customer less motivated by price and promotion and more likely to make a purchase based upon the value we offer  which considers fashion  quality and price 
remerchandising stores in the summer of fiscal  we rolled out our new merchandising presentation standards which feature our products in lifestyle settings that we refer to as rooms 
one of the benefits of our new rooms format is that it allows us to better measure the productivity of our product offering and make modifications to the assortment as needed 
during fiscal  we plan to test variations of the merchandise offered within our stores with the goal of increasing the overall sales per square foot and resulting profits 
to date  tests that are planned include introducing a bath assortment into stores  featuring a limited selection of the top selling bombaykids product in a few larger stores  reallocating a portion of bombaykids square footage in a selected number of stores and replacing it with other bombay merchandise that we believe would be more productive  and remerchandising certain stores with assortments that are more relevant to the current shopper 
we expect to conduct the tests over the course of the year and adapt our store assortments based upon those results 
reducing promotional activity we intend to selectively reduce the level of promotional activity as we continue to offer an upgraded assortment and improve quality 
we believe that progress made during the second half of fiscal toward higher product margins should continue into the first half of fiscal we expect product margin improvement in the to basis point range during the year 
controlling costs during the early phases of the turnaround  we have made investments in infrastructure to help support the growing base of stores and increasing complexities of being a multi channel retailer 
we completed the roll out of the new point of sale system to our stores and improved our store telecommunication environment 
we relaunched our internet site on a more stable  reliable platform 
we have made improvements in our planning and allocations system and expect to continue to invest in this area in order to improve our ability to forecast and assort our stores 
while we believe that these investments are critical to our future success  we also need to ensure that our expenses are in line with our revenue base 
as a result  we have taken steps in other areas to right size the organization and will continue to focus on cost control in order to ensure that infrastructure costs are in line with the planned reduction in the store count during fiscal growing customer base as we upgrade our assortment and migrate our stores to new off mall locations  connecting with the right customer is critical to our future success 
as part of our efforts to grow our customer base  we need to not only attract more customers but we need to attract the right customer who can grow with bombay as we reposition the brand 
we plan to invest in marketing to drive both retail and internet sales 
a key focus will be gathering additional customer names and email addresses with a goal of doubling the current number of customers in our databases 
we intend to test new reach vehicles and increase the focus on gathering customer information at the point of sale 
recent investments in technology are expected to help us more effectively manage our customer databases and increase the effectiveness of direct marketing efforts across all channels 
improving the supply chain over the past three years  we have made investments in the supply chain focusing in large part on improving the domestic distribution network opening new distribution centers in the midwest  northeast and canada 
during fiscal  we made technology investments that will improve visibility to orders within the global supply chain and appointed a logistics services provider to assist in managing the flow of product in an efficient  cost effective manner worldwide 
these actions are expected to improve our ability to manage inventory flow and reduce overall supply chain costs 
other disclosures the largest percentage of our sales and operating income is realized in the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes december christmas season 
same store sales comparisons are calculated based upon revenue from stores opened for more than months 
stores converted from the regular format to the large format and stores relocated from mall to off mall locations are classified as new and are excluded from same store sales until they have been open for months 
stores relocated within a mall and whose size is significantly changed are treated as new stores and are excluded from the same store sales calculation until opened for a full year 
remodeled stores remain in the computation of same store sales 
cost of sales includes all costs associated with the purchase of product including  but not limited to  vendor cost  inbound transportation costs  duties  commission  inspections  quality control  warehousing and outbound transportation costs 
buying costs include costs associated with our buying department  consisting primarily of salaries  travel  product development and product sample costs 
store occupancy costs include costs such as rent  real estate taxes  common area maintenance charges  utilities and depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets relating to our retail locations 
the impact of inflation on operating results is typically not significant because the majority of our products are proprietary 
we attempt to alleviate inflationary pressures by improving designs  finding alternative production sources in lower cost countries and increasing selling prices subject to competitive conditions 
an anti dumping petition against china furniture makers for allegedly dumping bedroom furniture was filed during this created some disruption in the industry and in our flow of product as we shifted orders to vendors with production capacity in other countries in preparation for the unfavorable duties 
the actual duties determined by the department of commerce were announced late in and we do not expect the impact of these duties to have a material effect on operations going forward 
we have a retail week fiscal year that ends on the saturday nearest january all periods presented reflect weeks

increases from new stores were partially offset by the closing of large format stores and four regular stores  which  in aggregate  contributed approximately million to net sales in fiscal direct to customer sales increased to million from million in the previous year  attributable to growth in internet sales  which more than offset the decline in mail order revenue 
wholesale sales declined to million from million in fiscal due primarily to a decline in the bailey street business

in addition  distribution center costs increased as a result of higher average inventory levels and higher distribution center costs in part due to recording a million impairment relating to a lease for an idle warehouse most recently used by the bailey street operations 
buying and occupancy costs were of revenue for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in buying and occupancy cost is primarily attributable to higher rents and depreciation expense as we annualized new store openings  as well as higher utility costs 
fiscal cost of sales  including buying and store occupancy costs  for fiscal was million  or of revenue  up from of revenue in fiscal product margins declined basis points as a result of issues with merchandise mix  promotional activity and a general softness in the home furnishings retail sector 
additionally  distribution costs had a negative impact on margins as they were deleveraged on a lower sales volume 
buying and store occupancy costs increased basis points  reflecting the deleveraging impact of these relatively fixed costs compared to the lower sales volume 
store impairments fiscal store impairment charges were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the charges were incurred in connection with the impairment of fixed assets related to unprofitable stores 
following two years of declines in same stores sales for bombay  there was an increase in the number of stores where impairment was required 
in addition  some stores that had been open for two holiday seasons were identified for impairment as profitability was significantly lower than had originally been projected 
fiscal store impairment charges were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the non cash charges were incurred in connection with the impairment of fixed assets related to unprofitable stores 
selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal at the store level  sg a expenses increased million  or basis points compared to fiscal the increase was driven primarily by a million increase in store payroll and payroll related costs as well as higher credit card fees  which vary with sales 
marketing and visual merchandising costs increased approximately million or basis points as we have continued to invest in marketing to reach new customers  primarily in the direct to customer channel 
these increases were partially offset by a million or basis point decrease in corporate office sg a 
insurance and taxes declined million  primarily due to lower medical insurance costs 
payroll and payroll related costs decreased million or basis points due to cost saving measures taken over the past year 
credit and collections  supplies and telephone expenses of the corporate office also declined  by a less significant amount 
professional services increased million in connection with the merchandise strategy study conducted in the first half of fiscal as well as professional service fees incurred in connection with asset sales 
sg a associated with our direct to customer operations decreased million or basis points compared to last year as a result of the lower volume primarily on the internet which resulted in a decline in hosting and other variable expenses 
fiscal sg a expenses were million compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal at the store level  expenses increased million  or basis points 
the increase was driven primarily by a million increase in store payroll resulting from the higher store count over the course of the year 
on a per store basis  total costs were down as we tightly managed expenses in a soft sales environment 
the basis point increase as a percentage of revenue is the result of the same store sales declines and a general softness in sales for all stores making it difficult to leverage fixed costs  particularly early in the year when store payroll costs tend to be more fixed in nature 
marketing and visual merchandising costs increased approximately million or basis points to of total revenue 
the increase in this category resulted from our decision to continue to invest in marketing despite the soft sales trend in order to drive traffic and reach new customers 
corporate office sg a expenses increased million  or basis points over the prior year  due to higher medical and other insurance costs of million and higher severance expenses of million associated with right sizing the organization 
additionally  audit expenses increased approximately million as a result of the new requirements for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of internet and mail order sg a expenses increased by million due to higher internet sales and higher hosting and design costs as we launched our updated website on a new platform 
also  we had approximately million less foreign exchange gain resulting from changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate  in addition to other less significant changes 
current year depreciation was million lower than in fiscal as a result of the prior year charge of million associated with replacing the company s point of sales system 
additionally  corporate incentive based compensation expense was million lower in fiscal than in fiscal interest fiscal during fiscal  we generated interest income of  and interest expense of  compared to interest income of  and interest expense of  in fiscal during fiscal  the company accelerated the seasonal inventory build up to an earlier timeframe to support the new merchandise and presentation  resulting in lower cash balances  earlier and higher borrowings  causing the increase in interest expense and a decrease in interest income 
in addition  the average interest rate increased approximately basis points compared to last year 
fiscal during fiscal  we had interest income of  and interest expense of  compared to interest income of  and interest expense of  in fiscal interest income declined as we had lower levels of invested cash balances during the year resulting from the lack of profitability 
however  interest expense also declined as we managed inventory levels and maintained average borrowing levels lower than in fiscal income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal  income tax benefit of million in fiscal and income tax expense of million in fiscal the effective rates for income tax expense benefit were  and in the respective periods 
the income tax expense incurred in fiscal was the result of recording a non cash charge of million in connection with providing a valuation allowance against all us deferred tax assets as a result of cumulative losses in recent years 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  this valuation allowance will be adjusted in the future resulting in the reinstatement of all or part of the deferred tax assets when operating results demonstrate a pattern of future profitability  in reversal of the current cumulative three year loss trend 
the adjustment has no impact on cash flow in the current or any future period 
fluctuations in the effective tax rate between fiscal and fiscal were primarily related to foreign taxes associated with our canadian subsidiary and the relative significance of the profit generated by the canadian subsidiary to the overall consolidated entity  as well as the impact of state tax expenses that have not changed proportionately to income loss before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and a line of credit 
we have a secured  revolving credit agreement with a group of banks  with an aggregate commitment of up to million for working capital  inventory financing and letter of credit purposes 
the available commitment under the facility is limited to a borrowing base generally comprised of of eligible us inventory and of eligible canadian inventory  and of receivables  as defined in the credit agreement and with seasonal and reserve adjustments 
at january   the available commitment was million  of which million had been utilized for letters of credit  and million was available for borrowings or additional letters of credit 
the credit facility expires september  fiscal we ended the year with cash and short term investments of million  million lower than at the previous year end 
although we recorded a net loss of million  cash provided by operations was million  due primarily to non cash depreciation  amortization and store impairmants of million  changes in the deferred income taxes and other non cash charges of million  and a million reduction in inventory levels 
cash flows from operations also reflect million of landlord construction allowances that store and distribution center landlords have agreed to pay which helps reduce the outlay of cash related to the new construction 
at january   inventory balances were million lower than at january  due primarily to lower levels of merchandise in transit and therefore  amounts owed to vendors as of the end of the year 
inventory at the store level and in the distribution centers was similar to last year s levels 
total inventory was per square foot of retail space as of the end of fiscal compared to per square foot last year 
on a per store basis  inventories decreased to  per store compared to  per store last year 
during fiscal  we sold a portion of the assets of our wholesale operations  bailey street to an unrelated third party 
under the terms of the agreement  bombay received million in cash in return for million in accounts receivable and million in inventories as well as intellectual property  equipment and facilities associated with the operations 
the buyer also assumed certain normal operating liabilities associated with the operations 
these changes in working capital have been reflected in the change in cash flows from operations 
cash used in investing activities totaled million during the current year 
total capital expenditures were million  as we opened stores  including large format stores and bombaykids locations  and relocated our canadian distribution center during the year in addition to making routine purchases of software and equipment 
the investments were partially offset by net proceeds totaling million from the sale of non operating assets including land and a bank building adjacent to our headquarters in fort worth  texas and million of proceeds from the sale of long lived assets associated with the bailey street operations 
cash used in financing activities totaling million during fiscal relates to proceeds from exercises of options and stock sales in connection with employee benefit plans 
from a liquidity and capital expenditures standpoint  our strategy is to utilize our credit facility to finance seasonal borrowings and working capital required by store growth  while we utilize cash flow from operations and our balance sheet to finance our capital programs 
the operating losses for fiscal and fiscal and the resulting decline in our cash balance has caused us to reassess our liquidity and capital program and investigate alternatives to fund the continued migration of stores from mall to off mall and the growth of the bombaykids stores 
in addition  we have previously announced that we plan to reduce store growth for fiscal compared to investments in recent years 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and cash available under our existing credit facilities  as well as potential additional liquidity that might be obtained by selling or otherwise monetizing the company owned office building  will be sufficient to finance our operations and expected capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if cash flow from operations fails to meet our expectations  we might experience liquidity issues during periods when our cash needs peak typically in the fall prior to holiday season and might require additional external funding to support our operations 
although we believe we would have access to additional debt and or capital market funding if needed  such funds might not be available to us on acceptable terms 
our capital requirements for fiscal are estimated to be to million net  excluding landlord allowances of approximately to million  consisting primarily of costs to open to new stores during the year 
in connection with continuing operations  we have various contractual obligations and commercial commitments requiring payment in future periods  summarized in the table below 
 payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations real estate operating leases unconditional purchase orders equipment operating leases employment contracts other contractual obligations total contractual cash obligations commercial commitments import letters of credit standby letters of credit guarantees of travel cards total commercial commitment fiscal during fiscal  we ended the year with cash and short term investments of million  million lower than at the previous year end 
although we recorded a net loss of million  cash provided by operations was million  due primarily to non cash depreciation  amortization and store impairments of million and an increased accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
cash flows from operations also reflects million of landlord construction allowances that store and distribution center landlords have agreed to reimburse us for which helps reduce the outlay of cash related to the new construction 
at january   inventory balances were million higher than at january  due primarily to higher level of merchandise in transit from the vendors as of the end of the year 
inventory at the store level and in the distribution centers was similar to last year s levels 
inventory was per square foot of retail space as of the end of fiscal compared to per square foot last year 
on a per store basis  inventories decreased to  per store compared to  per store last year 
cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures were million  as we opened stores  including large format stores and bombaykids locations  and relocated our northeastern distribution center during the year in addition to making routine purchases of software and equipment 
cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million during fiscal as a result of equity transactions with employees and employee benefits plans 
critical accounting policies and estimates in the course of preparing the consolidated financial statements  management makes certain judgments relative to accounting policies that are appropriate in the circumstances and the application of those policies 
the following policies are those deemed to be most critical 
inventory valuation policy inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined based upon the weighted average inventory method 
cost is calculated based upon the actual landed cost of an item at the time it is received in the warehouse based upon actual vendor invoices or estimates of costs for which an invoice is not present or for which an allocation of shared costs is required 
in addition  we include the cost of warehousing and transporting product to the stores in our costs 
we regularly evaluate our compliance with the lower of cost or market principle 
items are evaluated by sku and to the extent that the cost of the item exceeds the current selling price  provision is made to reduce the carrying cost of the item 
additionally  we review the aging of our inventory by sku 
the carrying cost of the item is reduced based upon certain age criteria and product category 
since the determination of carrying value of inventory involves both estimation and judgment of cost and market value  differences in these estimates could result in valuations that vary from the recorded asset 
each month  we record an allowance for shrinkage to provide for the cost of lost or stolen inventory 
the amount of the allowance is determined based upon the historical shrinkage results and is adjusted at least annually to reflect current circumstances 
inventory is physically counted at all locations at least once each year  at which time actual results are reflected in the financial statements 
physical counts were taken at substantially all stores and distribution centers during january impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets with definite lives at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
this review includes the evaluation of individual under performing retail stores and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of the fixed assets related to the store 
future cash flows are projected for the remaining lease life using a probability weighted approach to estimate the fair value of the store assets 
these projections consider such factors as future sales levels  gross margins  changes in rent and other expenses as well as the overall operating environment specific to that store 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  we record a charge equal to the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value as an impairment 
since the projection of future cash flows involves judgment and estimates  differences in circumstances or estimates could produce different results 
deferred taxes we estimate income taxes in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
this includes estimating the actual current tax expense together with deferred tax assets and liabilities arising as a result of temporary differences between income and expense reported for financial report and tax report purposes 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and the fact that a benefit may be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmental complexity 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis  considering all available positive and negative evidence  including the reversal patterns of the assets  our past results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years  our forecast of future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the accounting guidance suggests that factors such as recent losses carry substantially more weight than forecasts of future profitably 
as a result  we established a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets as of the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  this valuation allowance may be adjusted in the future resulting in the reinstatement of all or a part of its deferred tax assets when our results demonstrate a pattern of future profitability 
we expect that until such time  the consolidated income tax provision will only reflect modest levels of foreign taxation 
insurance we are self insured with respect to medical and dental insurance coverage offered to our eligible employees  up to a maximum of  per claim 
above that amount  medical insurance coverage is in place 
in connection with the self insured portion  we maintain a liability for claims that are in the process of being paid and those that have been incurred but not yet reported to our insurance carrier 
we base the amount of the liability upon historical claims experience and actuarial estimates regarding the exposure for claims incurred but not yet reported 
at january   the balance of the medical and dental liability was million 
since fiscal  we have also maintained workers compensation insurance coverage with a deductible of up to  per claim 
at january   we had recorded a liability of million representing the estimated amount that will have to be paid in future periods related to the settlement of claims under the insurance policies for fiscal through fiscal the amount of the liability reflects expected remaining workers compensation claims based upon actuarial estimates  utilizing historical claims experience and other relevant information and trends 
prior to fiscal  our workers compensation insurance was not subject to a deductible 
similarly  beginning in fiscal  our general liability insurance coverage includes a deductible of  per occurrence 
as of january   we recorded a liability of million relating to estimated amounts that will have to be paid in future periods relating to the current fiscal year based upon historical claims experience and actuarial estimates regarding exposure for claims incurred but not yet reported 
prior to fiscal  our general liability insurance was not subject to a deductible 
if circumstances change or if information becomes available that would indicate that future payments with respect to insurance liabilities would be different than what was previously estimated  we will adjust such liabilities accordingly 
since the amounts recorded for insurance liabilities are based upon various estimates  actual future requirements could vary from the recorded liabilities 
new accounting pronouncements in october  fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which requires that rental costs incurred during the construction period of new stores be charged to rental expense as a period cost 
our practice had been to capitalize such rents as part of the cost of the asset and amortize them over the asset s estimated useful life 
we have elected early adoption and have chosen to retrospectively apply fsp fas to prior years financial statements for enhanced comparability with peers and consistency of internal treatment for all properties 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for a change in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
additionally  retrospective application is not required when explicit transition requirements specific to newly adopted accounting principles exist 
retrospective application requires the cumulative effect of the change on periods prior to those presented to be reflected in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the first period presented and the offsetting adjustments to be recorded to opening retained earnings 
sfas no 
retains the guidance contained in apb opinion no 
for reporting both the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
sfas no 
will become effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company has elected early adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
during the current fiscal year and has retrospectively applied the provisions of fsp fas as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
the primary focus of sfas r is on employee services obtained in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the financial statements based upon their fair values 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment 
this sab provides views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations  and is intended to assist in the initial implementation of sfas no 
r 
the standard is effective for our fiscal consolidated financial statements 
we intend to elect the modified prospective transition method  which requires that we recognize compensation expense for all new and unvested share based payment awards 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in an increase in compensation expense of approximately million for the fiscal in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
sfas no 
requires that fixed production costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities and that unallocated overheads be recognized as an expense in the periods in which they are incurred 
in addition  other items such as abnormal freight  handling costs and amounts of excess spoilage require treatment as current period charges rather than as a portion of the inventory cost 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal  at which time we will adopt the provisions of the standard 
we do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based upon the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have exposure to interest rate risk  as borrowings under our credit facility are based upon london interbank offered rate  prime and other benchmark rates which may fluctuate with market conditions 
based upon our seasonal borrowing levels  management does not believe that a change in interest rates of basis points would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as of january   we had no debt or other market risk sensitive instruments
