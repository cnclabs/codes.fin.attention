table of contents executive overview our diluted earnings per common share were for  a increase compared with return on average tangible common shareholders equity was and return on average common shareholders equity was 
our results in reflected strong growth in net revenues from trading and principal investments and asset management and securities services as well as higher net revenues in investment banking 
the increase in trading and principal investments reflected significantly higher net revenues in fixed income  currency and commodities ficc  as all major businesses performed well 
during  ficc operated in an environment generally characterized by strong customer driven activity  tight  but volatile  credit spreads  higher energy prices and a flatter yield curve 
net revenues in equities also improved significantly compared with the prior year  reflecting strong performance across the business 
equities operated in an environment characterized by generally higher equity prices  improved customer driven activity and continued low levels of market volatility 
net revenues in our principal investments business also increased significantly  primarily reflecting a gain on our investment in the convertible preferred stock of sumitomo mitsui financial group  inc smfg as well as gains from real estate principal investments 
the strong net revenue growth in asset management and securities services primarily reflected higher assets under management and higher customer balances in securities services 
the increase in investment banking net revenues was due to significantly higher net revenues in debt underwriting and improved results in financial advisory  primarily reflecting an increase in industry wide corporate activity  partially offset by lower net revenues in equity underwriting 
our investment banking backlog at the end of was significantly higher than at the end of our operating results for reflected generally favorable market conditions and strong customer driven activity levels 
we continued to see favorable trading and investing opportunities for our clients and ourselves  particularly during the second half of our fiscal year 
consequently  during the second half of we increased our market risk  particularly in equities and interest rate products  to capitalize on these opportunities 
net revenues in our equities and ficc businesses surpassed previous peak levels 
our investment banking net revenues reflected our best performance in four years as corporate activity continued to recover  particularly in announced and completed mergers and acquisitions and debt underwriting  although competitive pressures remained 
we also continued to focus on managing our capital base  with the goal of optimizing our returns while  at the same time  growing our businesses 
during  we repurchased million shares of our stock at a cost of billion 
with respect to the regulatory environment  financial services firms continued to be under intense scrutiny  with the volume and amount of claims against financial institutions and other related costs remaining significant 
given the range of litigation and investigations presently under way  our litigation expenses can be expected to remain high 
though our operating results were strong in  our business  by its nature  does not produce predictable earnings 
our results in any given period can be materially affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions generally 
for a further discussion of these trends and other factors affecting our businesses  see certain risk factors that may affect our business below as well as risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k 
return on average tangible common shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders equity

table of contents business environment as an investment banking  securities and investment management firm  our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally  both in the united states and elsewhere around the world 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by low inflation  low or declining interest rates  and strong equity markets 
over the business cycle  these factors provide a positive climate for our investment banking activities  for many of our trading businesses and for wealth creation  which contributes to growth in our asset management business 
although short term interest rates  particularly in the united states  continued to rise and the yield curve continued to flatten  economic conditions remained generally favorable during  as global interest rates remained at historically low levels  core inflation was broadly contained  global equity prices generally rose and corporate activity continued to improve 
for a further discussion of how market conditions can affect our businesses  see certain risk factors that may affect our business below as well as risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k 
a further discussion of the business environment in is set forth below 
global 
after strong growth in  the global economy remained solid in  despite a brief period of weakness during our fiscal second quarter 
worldwide real gross domestic product growth for the calendar year  although lower than the prior year  was slightly above the average of the past years 
energy prices rose significantly during the first nine months of our fiscal year  peaking at the beginning of our fourth quarter  but the sharp increase did not appear to have a significant impact on global growth 
in addition  the us economy performed well and the japanese economy continued to grow at a moderate pace  particularly in the first half of the calendar year 
the us federal reserve continued to raise rates in  increasing its federal funds rate target by a total of basis points during our fiscal year 
despite the increase in us short term rates  fixed income markets generally performed well  as long term bond yields remained generally low and corporate credit spreads remained generally tight 
in the currency markets  the us dollar strengthened against the major currencies  although it weakened against a number of emerging market currencies such as the brazilian real  mexican peso  chinese yuan and korean won 
global equity markets generally rose during the year  with significant increases in many markets around the world 
corporate activity continued to improve during the year 
although equity and equity related volumes were essentially unchanged from  debt underwriting volumes improved and industry wide announced and completed mergers and acquisitions increased significantly 
united states 
the us economy grew at a strong pace during the year 
real gross domestic product rose by approximately in the calendar year  driven principally by continued strength in the housing market and consumer spending 
despite hurricane related disruptions  consumer spending reached its highest rate of growth during the third calendar quarter 
after slowing modestly in the first quarter of  the rate of inflation increased  particularly in the third quarter  as energy prices rose significantly 
however  measures of core inflation remained broadly contained 
in response to the improving environment and rising inflation  the us federal reserve raised its federal funds rate target by basis points in each of its meetings  bringing the rate to by the end of our fiscal year 
despite the sharp rise in short term interest rates  the year us treasury note yield ended the year only basis points higher 
although the us dollar generally strengthened throughout the year  financial conditions remained generally supportive of economic activity 
the dow jones industrial average  s p index and nasdaq composite index increased by  and  respectively  during our fiscal year 
europe 
the pace of economic growth in europe remained slow as real gross domestic product in the eurozone economies grew by approximately in the calendar year 
economic conditions in the eurozone economies softened in the first half of the year as business sentiment deteriorated and energy prices rose 
however  conditions improved modestly later in the year as continued strength in the global economy and the weakening of the euro supported higher growth in exports and investment spending 
the european central bank left interest rates unchanged through our fiscal year 
in the uk  real gross domestic product growth appeared to slow 
table of contents sharply  declining to approximately in the calendar year  reflecting softer growth in consumption and investment spending 
the bank of england reduced interest rates by basis points and long term bond yields in both the eurozone and the uk ended the year lower 
despite the modest economic growth  the ftse index increased by and continental european equity markets also increased significantly during our fiscal year 
asia 
japan s economy grew at its strongest pace since  with real gross domestic product growing by over for the second consecutive calendar year 
the recovery in domestic demand and private investment drove much of the improvement  while exports improved in the second half of the calendar year 
the unemployment rate fell to in from in the bank of japan continued to provide substantial liquidity to the market and continued to hold short term interest rates at zero percent through the year and long term bond yields ended the year slightly lower 
with short term interest rates rising in the us  the yen weakened and financial conditions remained generally supportive of economic activity 
the nikkei index increased during our fiscal year 
elsewhere in asia  china s real gross domestic product growth remained robust  with growth particularly reliant on higher net exports  as demonstrated by china s large current account surplus 
china s modest currency revaluation in july did not result in further significant exchange rate developments in the region 
growth in india remained very strong  which  together with china  supported growth throughout the region 
equity markets across the region generally rose  with markets in south korea and india posting significant gains during our fiscal year 
certain risk factors that may affect our business we face a variety of risks that are substantial and inherent in our businesses  including market  liquidity  credit  operational  legal and regulatory risks 
for a discussion of how management seeks to manage some of these risks  see risk management below 
a summary of the more important factors that could affect our business follows below 
for a further discussion of these and other important factors that could affect our business  see risk factors in part i  item a of the annual report on form k 
market conditions and market risk 
our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally and these conditions may change suddenly and dramatically 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions have adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect  our business and profitability in many ways  including the following we have been operating in a low interest rate market for the past several years 
increasing or high interest rates and or widening credit spreads  especially if such changes are rapid  may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses 
we have been committing increasing amounts of capital in many of our businesses and generally maintain large trading  specialist and investing positions 
market fluctuations and volatility may adversely affect the value of those positions  including  but not limited to  our interest rate and credit products  currency  commodity and equity positions and our merchant banking investments  or may reduce our willingness to enter into new transactions 
from time to time  we have incurred significant trading losses in periods of market turbulence 
conversely  certain of our trading businesses depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities  and decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these businesses 
industry wide declines in the size and number of underwritings and mergers and acquisitions may have an adverse effect on our revenues and  because we may be unable to reduce expenses correspondingly  our profit margins 
in particular  because a significant portion of our investment banking revenues are derived from our participation in large transactions  a 
table of contents decrease in the number of large transactions due to uncertain or unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our investment banking business 
pricing and other competitive pressures have continued  even as the volume and number of investment banking transactions have increased 
in addition  the trend in the underwriting business toward multiple book runners and co managers handling transactions  where previously there would have been a single book runner  may adversely affect our business and reduce our revenues 
reductions in the level of the equity markets also tend to reduce the value of our clients portfolios  which in turn may reduce the fees we earn for managing assets 
even in the absence of uncertain or unfavorable economic or market conditions  investment performance by our asset management business below the performance of benchmarks or competitors could result in a decline in assets under management and in the incentive and management fees we receive 
concentration of risk increases the potential for significant losses in our market making  proprietary trading and investing  block trading  merchant banking  underwriting and lending businesses 
this risk may increase to the extent we expand our proprietary trading and investing businesses or commit capital to facilitate customer driven business 
for example  large blocks of securities are increasingly being sold in block trades rather than on a marketed basis  which increases the risk that goldman sachs may be unable to resell the purchased securities at favorable prices and may incur significant losses as a result 
moreover  because of concentration of risk  we may suffer losses even when economic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in the industry 
we also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses 
the number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period 
the volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and as a specialist or market maker may decline  which would reduce the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads 
in addition  competitive pressures and other industry factors  including the increasing use by our clients of low cost electronic trading  could cause a reduction in commissions and spreads 
in our specialist businesses  we are obligated by stock exchange rules to maintain an orderly market  including by purchasing shares in a declining market 
this may result in trading losses and an increased need for liquidity 
weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our trading businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  competitive pressures have been particularly intense in the context of block trades 
for a further discussion of our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  see critical accounting policies goodwill and identifiable intangible assets below 
while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques  those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes 
thus  we may  in the course of our activities  incur losses 
liquidity risk 
liquidity is essential to our businesses 
our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access secured and or unsecured debt markets  an inability to access funds from our subsidiaries  an inability to sell assets or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that we are unable to control  such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties or us 
further  our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time 

table of contents our credit ratings are important to our liquidity 
a reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position  increase our borrowing costs  limit our access to the capital markets or trigger our obligations under certain bilateral provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts 
under these provisions  counterparties could be permitted to terminate contracts with goldman sachs or require us to post additional collateral 
termination of our trading and collateralized financing contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements 
for a discussion of the potential impact on goldman sachs of a reduction in our credit ratings  see capital and funding credit ratings below 
credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money  securities or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances 
in addition  a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could result in losses and or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes 
the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years  as has the breadth of the entities to which we have credit exposures 
the scope of our lending businesses has also been expanding and includes loans to small and mid size businesses  which are not traditional goldman sachs clients 
as a clearing member firm  we finance our client positions and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our clients 
in addition  we have experienced  due to competitive factors  pressure to extend and price credit at levels that may not always fully compensate us for the risks we take 
in particular  corporate clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with investment banking and other assignments 
although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries  countries and regions that we believe may present credit concerns  default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee 
in addition  concerns about  or a default by  one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems  losses or defaults by other institutions  which in turn could adversely affect goldman sachs 
operational risk 
shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  or external events could lead to impairment of our liquidity  financial loss  disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
for example  our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
the transactions we process have become increasingly complex and often must adhere to client specific guidelines  as well as legal and regulatory standards 
despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by goldman sachs or third parties with which we conduct business 
legal and regulatory risk 
we are subject to extensive and evolving regulation in jurisdictions around the world 
substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against goldman sachs could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to goldman sachs  which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects 
firms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment 
we face significant legal risks in our businesses  and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high 
for a discussion of how we account for our legal and regulatory exposures  see use of estimates below 

table of contents critical accounting policies fair value the use of fair value to measure our financial instruments  with related unrealized gains and losses recognized immediately in our results of operations  is fundamental to our financial statements and is our most critical accounting policy 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
in determining fair value  we separate our financial instruments into three categories cash ie  nonderivative trading instruments  derivative contracts and principal investments  as set forth in the following table financial instruments by category in millions as of november financial financial financial instruments sold  financial instruments sold  instruments but not yet instruments but not yet owned  at purchased  at owned  at purchased  at fair value fair value fair value fair value cash trading instruments derivative contracts principal investments total excludes assets for which goldman sachs is not at risk eg  assets related to consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
represents an economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
for a further discussion of our investment in smfg  see principal investments below 

table of contents cash trading instruments 
the following table sets forth the valuation of our cash trading instruments by level of price transparency cash trading instruments by price transparency in millions as of november financial financial financial instruments sold  financial instruments sold  instruments but not yet instruments but not yet owned  at purchased  at owned  at purchased  at fair value fair value fair value fair value quoted prices or alternative pricing sources with reasonable price transparency little or no price transparency total fair values of our cash trading instruments are generally obtained from quoted market prices in active markets  broker or dealer price quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued in this manner include us government and agency securities  other sovereign government obligations  liquid mortgage products  investment grade corporate bonds  listed equities  money market securities  state  municipal and provincial obligations  and physical commodities 
certain cash trading instruments trade infrequently and have little or no price transparency 
such instruments may include certain high yield debt  corporate bank loans  mortgage whole loans and distressed debt 
we value these instruments initially at cost and generally do not adjust valuations unless there is substantive evidence supporting a change in the value of the underlying instrument or valuation assumptions such as similar market transactions  changes in financial ratios or changes in the credit ratings of the underlying companies 
where there is evidence supporting a change in the value  we use valuation methodologies such as the present value of known or estimated cash flows 
cash trading instruments we own long positions are marked to bid prices and instruments we have sold but not yet purchased short positions are marked to offer prices 
if liquidating a position is expected to affect its prevailing market price  our valuation is adjusted generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies 
in certain circumstances  such as for highly illiquid positions  management s estimates are used to determine this adjustment 

table of contents derivative contracts 
derivative contracts consist of exchange traded and over the counter otc derivatives 
the following table sets forth the fair value of our exchange traded and otc derivative assets and liabilities derivative assets and liabilities in millions as of november assets liabilities assets liabilities exchange traded derivatives otc derivatives total net of cash received pursuant to credit support agreements of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
net of cash paid pursuant to credit support agreements of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
fair values of our exchange traded derivatives are generally determined from quoted market prices 
otc derivatives are valued using valuation models 
we use a variety of valuation models including the present value of known or estimated cash flows and option pricing models 
the valuation models that we use to derive the fair values of our otc derivatives require inputs including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs 
the selection of a model to value an otc derivative depends upon the contractual terms of  and specific risks inherent in  the instrument as well as the availability of pricing information in the market 
we generally use similar models to value similar instruments 
where possible  we verify the values produced by our pricing models to market transactions 
for otc derivatives that trade in liquid markets  such as generic forwards  swaps and options  model selection does not involve significant judgment because market prices are readily available 
for otc derivatives that trade in less liquid markets  model selection requires more judgment because such instruments tend to be more complex and pricing information is less available in these markets 
price transparency is inherently more limited for more complex structures because they often combine one or more product types  requiring additional inputs such as correlations and volatilities 
as markets continue to develop and more pricing information becomes available  we continue to review and refine the models that we use 
at the inception of an otc derivative contract day one  we value the contract at the model value if we can verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions 
when appropriate  valuations are adjusted to reflect various factors such as liquidity  bid offer spreads and credit considerations 
these adjustments are generally based on market evidence or predetermined policies 
in certain circumstances  such as for highly illiquid positions  management s estimates are used to determine these adjustments 
where we cannot verify all of the significant model inputs to observable market data and verify the model to market transactions  we value the contract at the transaction price at inception and  consequently  record no day one gain or loss in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
following day one  we adjust the inputs to our valuation models only to the extent that changes in these inputs can be verified by similar market transactions  third party pricing services and or broker quotes  or can be derived from other substantive evidence such as empirical market data 
in circumstances where we cannot verify the model to market transactions  it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value 

table of contents the following tables set forth the fair values of our otc derivative assets and liabilities by product and by remaining contractual maturity otc derivatives in millions as of november assets years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total liabilities years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total as of november assets years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total liabilities years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total we enter into certain otc option transactions that provide us or our counterparties with the right to extend the maturity of the underlying contract 
the fair value of these option contracts is not material to the aggregate fair value of our otc derivative portfolio 
in the tables above  for option contracts that require settlement by delivery of an underlying derivative instrument  the remaining contractual maturity is generally classified based upon the maturity date of the underlying derivative instrument 
in those instances where the underlying instrument does not have a maturity date or either counterparty has the right to settle in cash  the remaining contractual maturity is generally based upon the option expiration date 

table of contents principal investments 
in valuing our corporate and real estate principal investments  we separate our portfolio into investments in private companies  investments in public companies excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg and our investment in smfg 
the following table sets forth the carrying value of our principal investments portfolio principal investments in millions as of november corporate real estate total corporate real estate total private public subtotal smfg convertible preferred stock total excludes assets for which goldman sachs is not at risk eg  assets related to consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
the fair value of our japanese yen denominated investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg includes the effect of foreign exchange revaluation 
we hedge our economic exposure to exchange rate movements on our investment in smfg by borrowing japanese yen 
foreign exchange revaluation on the investment and the related borrowing are generally equal and offsetting 
for example  if the japanese yen appreciates against the us dollar  the us dollar carrying value of our smfg investment will increase and the us dollar carrying value of the related borrowing will also increase by an amount that is generally equal and offsetting 
excludes an economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg 
as of november   the fair value of this hedge was billion and is reflected in financial instruments sold  but not yet purchased  at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
for a further discussion of the restrictions on our ability to hedge or sell the common stock underlying our investment in smfg  see below 
our private principal investments  by their nature  have little or no price transparency 
such investments are initially carried at cost as an approximation of fair value 
adjustments to carrying value are made if there are third party transactions evidencing a change in value 
downward adjustments are also made  in the absence of third party transactions  if we determine that the expected realizable value of the investment is less than the carrying value 
in reaching that determination  we consider many factors including  but not limited to  the operating cash flows and financial performance of the companies or properties relative to budgets or projections  trends within sectors and or regions  underlying business models  expected exit timing and strategy  and any specific rights or terms associated with the investment  such as conversion features and liquidation preferences 
our public principal investments  which tend to be large  concentrated holdings that result from initial public offerings or other corporate transactions  are valued using quoted market prices discounted based on predetermined written policies for nontransferability and illiquidity 
our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg is carried at fair value  which is derived from a model that incorporates smfg s common stock price and credit spreads  the impact of nontransferability and illiquidity  and the downside protection on the conversion strike price 
the fair value of our investment is particularly sensitive to movements in the smfg common stock price 
as a result of transfer restrictions and the downside protection on the conversion strike price  the relationship between changes in the fair value of our investment and changes in smfg s common 
table of contents stock price is nonlinear 
during our fiscal year  the fair value of our investment excluding the economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying one third of our investment increased expressed in japanese yen  primarily due to an increase in the smfg common stock price and  to a lesser extent  the impact of passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock 
our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg is generally nontransferable  but is freely convertible into smfg common stock 
restrictions on our ability to hedge or sell one third of the common stock underlying our investment in smfg lapsed in february as of november  we were fully hedged with respect to these unrestricted shares 
under our initial agreement with smfg  restrictions on our ability to hedge or sell the remaining shares of common stock underlying our investment in smfg lapse in equal installments on february  and february  in connection with a public offering by smfg of its common stock  we have separately agreed with smfg that the restrictions that were to lapse on february  will instead lapse on march  effective february   the conversion price of our smfg preferred stock into shares of smfg common stock is  this price is subject to downward adjustment if the price of smfg common stock at the time of conversion is less than the conversion price subject to a floor of 
controls over valuation of financial instruments 
a control infrastructure  independent of the trading and investing functions  is fundamental to ensuring that our financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable 
this is particularly important in valuing instruments with lower levels of price transparency 
we employ an oversight structure that includes appropriate segregation of duties 
senior management  independent of the trading functions  is responsible for the oversight of control and valuation policies and for reporting the results of these policies to our audit committee 
we seek to maintain the necessary resources to ensure that control functions are performed to the highest standards 
we employ procedures for the approval of new transaction types and markets  price verification  review of daily profit and loss  and review of valuation models by personnel with appropriate technical knowledge of relevant products and markets 
these procedures are performed by personnel independent of the revenue producing units 
for trading and principal investments with little or no price transparency  we employ  where possible  procedures that include comparisons with similar observable positions  analysis of actual to projected cash flows  comparisons with subsequent sales and discussions with senior business leaders 
for a further discussion of how we manage the risks inherent in our trading and principal investing businesses  see risk management below 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  principally slk llc slk in fiscal  the ayco company  lp ayco in fiscal  cogentrix energy  inc cogentrix in fiscal and national energy gas transmission  inc negt in fiscal  we have acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets  including identifiable intangible assets  at the acquisition date 
goodwill 
we test the goodwill in each of our operating segments for impairment at least annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the estimated fair value of each operating segment with its estimated net book value 
we derive the fair value of each of our operating segments primarily based on price earnings multiples 
we derive the net book value of our operating segments by estimating the amount of shareholders equity required to support the assets of each operating segment 
our last annual impairment test was performed during our fiscal fourth quarter and no impairment was identified

identifiable intangible assets 
we amortize our identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives in accordance with sfas no 
 and test for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an impairment loss  calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value

a prolonged period of weakness in global equity markets and the trading of securities in multiple markets and on multiple exchanges could adversely impact our businesses and impair the value of our goodwill and or identifiable intangible assets 
in addition  certain events could indicate a potential impairment of our identifiable intangible assets  including i changes in market structure that could adversely affect our specialist businesses  ii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator or iii a default event under a power contract or physical damage or other adverse events impacting the underlying power generation facilities

in addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  the use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits 
we estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different 
our total liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case or proceeding  our experience and the experience of others in similar cases or proceedings  and the opinions and views of legal counsel 
given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of our litigation and regulatory matters  particularly in cases or proceedings in which 
table of contents substantial or indeterminate damages or fines are sought  we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for cases or proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred

results of operations the composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed

financial overview the following table sets forth an overview of our financial results financial overview in millions  except per share amounts year ended november net revenues pre tax earnings net earnings net earnings applicable to common shareholders diluted earnings per common share return on average common shareholders equity return on average tangible common shareholders equity return on average common shareholders equity is computed by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders equity 
tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock and goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
we believe that return on average tangible common shareholders equity is a meaningful measure of performance because it excludes the portion of our common shareholders equity attributable to goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
as a result  this calculation measures corporate performance in a manner that treats underlying businesses consistently  whether they were acquired or developed internally

substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily and  therefore  its value and our net revenues are subject to fluctuations based on market movements 
in addition  net revenues derived from our principal investments in privately held concerns and in real estate may fluctuate significantly depending on the revaluation or sale of these investments in any given period 
we also regularly enter into large transactions as part of our trading businesses 
the number and size of such transactions may affect our results of operations in a given period 
net revenues from principal investments do not include management fees generated from our merchant banking funds 
these management fees are included in the net revenues of the asset management and securities services segment

asset management provides investment advisory and financial planning services and offers investment products across all major asset classes to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide and primarily generates revenues in the form of management and incentive fees 
securities services 
securities services provides prime brokerage services  financing services and securities lending services to mutual funds  pension funds  hedge funds  foundations and high net worth individuals worldwide  and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees 
assets under management typically generate fees as a percentage of asset value 
in certain circumstances  we are also entitled to receive asset management incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund s return or when the return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark returns or other performance targets 
incentive fees are recognized when the performance period ends and they are no longer subject to adjustment 
we have numerous incentive fee arrangements  many of which have annual performance periods that end on december and are not subject to adjustment thereafter 
for that reason  incentive fees are seasonally weighted each year to our first fiscal quarter 
depending on the level of net revenues in our first fiscal quarter of  these incentive fees may be material to the results of operations in that quarter

off balance sheet arrangements we have various types of off balance sheet arrangements that we enter into in the ordinary course of business 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms  including purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in mortgage backed and other asset backed securitization vehicles  holding senior and subordinated debt  interests in limited and general partnerships  and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles  entering into interest rate  foreign currency  equity  commodity and credit derivatives  entering into operating leases  and providing guarantees  indemnifications  loan commitments  letters of credit  representations and warranties 
we enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes  primarily related to the securitization of commercial and residential mortgages  home equity and auto loans  government and corporate bonds  and other types of financial assets 
other reasons for entering into these arrangements include underwriting client securitization transactions  providing secondary market liquidity  making investments in performing and nonperforming debt  equity  real estate and other assets  providing investors with credit linked and asset repackaged notes  and receiving or providing letters of credit to satisfy margin requirements and to facilitate the clearance and settlement process 
variable interest entities vies and qualifying special purpose entities qspes are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets  including the mortgage backed and other asset backed securities markets  since they provide market liquidity to financial assets by offering investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process 
our financial interests in  and derivative transactions with  such nonconsolidated entities are accounted for at fair value  in the same manner as our other financial instruments  except in cases where we exert significant influence over an entity and apply the equity method of accounting

goldman sachs total capital total shareholders equity and long term borrowings increased to billion as of november compared with billion as of november see risk management liquidity risk cash flows below for a discussion of how we deployed capital raised as part of our financing activities 
the increase in total capital resulted primarily from an increase in long term borrowings to billion as of november from billion as of november the weighted average maturity of our long term borrowings as of november was approximately seven years 
we swap a substantial portion of our long term borrowings into us dollar obligations with short term floating interest rates in order to minimize our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange movements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our long term borrowings 
over the past several years  our ratio of long term borrowings to total shareholders equity has been increasing 
the growth in our long term borrowings has been driven primarily by i our ability to replace a portion of our short term borrowings with long term borrowings and pre fund near term refinancing requirements  in light of the favorable debt financing environment  and ii the need to increase total capital in response to growth in our trading and investing businesses 

table of contents total shareholders equity increased by to billion common equity of billion and preferred stock of billion as of november from billion as of november during  goldman sachs issued  shares of preferred stock in three series as set forth in the following table preferred stock by series shares shares earliest redemption value series description date issued issued authorized redemption date in millions a perpetual floating rate april    april  non cumulative b perpetual october    october  non cumulative c perpetual floating rate october    october  non cumulative each share of preferred stock has a par value of  has a liquidation preference of  is represented by  depositary shares and is redeemable at our option at a redemption price equal to  plus declared and unpaid dividends 
our ability to declare or pay dividends on  or purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire  our common stock is subject to certain restrictions in the event we fail to pay or set aside full dividends on our preferred stock for the latest completed dividend period 
all preferred stock also has a preference over our common stock upon liquidation 
our stock repurchase program is intended to help maintain our total shareholders equity at appropriate levels and to substantially offset increases in share count over time resulting from employee equity based compensation 
the repurchase program has been effected primarily through regular open market purchases and is influenced by  among other factors  the level of our common shareholders equity  our overall capital position  employee equity awards granted and exercises of employee stock options  the prevailing market price of our common stock and general market conditions 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a total cost of billion  and during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a total cost of billion 
the average price paid per share for repurchased shares was and for the years ended november and november  respectively 
the increase in the level of repurchases in compared with primarily reflects our decision to manage the growth of our common shareholders equity 
in addition  to satisfy minimum statutory employee tax withholding requirements related to the delivery of shares underlying restricted stock units  we cancelled million restricted stock units at a total cost of million in and we cancelled million restricted stock units at a total cost of million in as of november  we were authorized to repurchase up to million additional shares of stock pursuant to our repurchase program

we consider junior subordinated debt issued to a trust to be a component of our tangible equity capital base due to the inherent characteristics of these securities  including the long term nature of the securities  our ability to defer coupon interest for up to ten consecutive semiannual periods and the subordinated nature of the obligations in our capital structure 
the following table sets forth the reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible equity capital as of november in millions total shareholders equity add junior subordinated debt issued to a trust deduct goodwill and identifiable intangible assets tangible equity capital 
table of contents leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity 
adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible equity capital 
we believe that the adjusted leverage ratio is a more meaningful measure of our capital adequacy than the leverage ratio because it excludes certain low risk collateralized assets that are generally supported with little or no capital and reflects the tangible equity capital deployed in our businesses 
debt to equity ratio equals long term borrowings divided by total shareholders equity 
tangible common shareholders equity equals total shareholders equity less preferred stock and goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible common shareholders equity as of november in millions total shareholders equity deduct preferred stock common shareholders equity deduct goodwill and identifiable intangible assets tangible common shareholders equity book value per common share is based on common shares outstanding  including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements  of million and million as of november and november  respectively 
tangible book value per common share is computed by dividing tangible common shareholders equity by the number of common shares outstanding  including restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements 
short term borrowings goldman sachs obtains secured and unsecured short term borrowings primarily through the issuance of promissory notes  commercial paper and bank loans 
short term borrowings also include the portion of long term borrowings maturing within one year of our financial statement date and certain long term borrowings that are redeemable within one year of our financial statement date at the option of the holder 
the following table sets forth our short term borrowings by product short term borrowings in millions as of november promissory notes commercial paper bank loans and other current portion of long term borrowings total our liquidity depends to an important degree on our ability to refinance these borrowings on a continuous basis 
investors who hold our outstanding promissory notes short term unsecured debt that is nontransferable and in which goldman sachs does not make a market and commercial paper have no obligation to purchase new instruments when the outstanding instruments mature 

table of contents the following table sets forth our secured and unsecured short term borrowings as of november in millions secured short term borrowings unsecured short term borrowings total short term borrowings a large portion of our secured short term borrowings are similar in nature to our other collateralized financing sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
these secured short term borrowings provide goldman sachs with a more stable source of liquidity than unsecured short term borrowings  as they are less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings due to underlying collateral 
our unsecured short term borrowings include extendible debt if the earliest maturity occurs within one year of our financial statement date 
extendible debt is debt that allows the holder the right to extend the maturity date at predetermined periods during the contractual life of the instrument 
these borrowings can be  and in the past generally have been  extended

credit ratings we rely upon the short term and long term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day to day operations 
the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings 
credit ratings are important when we are competing in certain markets and when we seek to engage in longer term transactions  including otc derivatives 
we believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies assessment of our liquidity  market  credit and operational risk management practices  the level and variability of our earnings  our capital base  our franchise  reputation and management  our corporate governance and the external operating environment

contractual obligations and contingent commitments goldman sachs has contractual obligations to make future payments under long term debt and long term noncancelable lease agreements and has contingent commitments under a variety of commercial arrangements 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of november contractual obligations in millions thereafter total long term borrowings by contract maturity minimum rental payments long term borrowings maturing within one year of our financial statement date and certain long term borrowings that are redeemable within one year of our financial statement date at the option of the holder are included as short term borrowings in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
long term borrowings repayable at the option of goldman sachs are reflected at their contractual maturity dates 
certain long term borrowings that are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the holder are reflected at the dates such options become exercisable 
as of november  our long term borrowings were billion and consisted principally of senior borrowings with maturities extending to these long term borrowings consisted of billion in secured long term borrowings and billion in unsecured long term borrowings 
as of november  long term borrowings included nonrecourse debt of billion  consisting of billion issued by william street funding corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of group inc formed to raise funding to support loan commitments to investment grade clients made by another wholly owned william street entity  and billion issued by other consolidated entities  of which billion was related to our power generation facilities 
nonrecourse debt is debt that only the issuing subsidiary or  if applicable  a subsidiary guaranteeing the debt is obligated to repay

table of contents the following table sets forth our quarterly long term borrowings maturity profile through fiscal long term borrowings maturity profile in millions long term borrowings maturity profile chart our long term borrowings include extendible debt if the earliest maturity is one year or greater from our financial statement date 
extendible debt is categorized in the maturity profile at the earliest possible maturity date even though the debt can be  and in the past generally has been  extended 
as of november  our future minimum rental payments  net of minimum sublease rentals  under noncancelable leases were billion 
these lease commitments  principally for office space  expire on various dates through certain agreements are subject to periodic escalation provisions for increases in real estate taxes and other charges 
during our third fiscal quarter of  we announced plans for a new world headquarters in new york city  with initial occupancy scheduled for  at an expected cost of billion to billion 
goldman sachs will partially finance the project with tax exempt liberty bonds 
as of november  we borrowed approximately billion through the issuance of liberty bonds and may borrow up to an additional million through the issuance of additional liberty bonds before as of november  we had outstanding construction related commitments of million in connection with this project 
included in our future minimum rental payments under noncancelable lease agreements is million related to a year ground lease for the land on which our world headquarters will be constructed  of which million is a lump sum payment due by june see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k for further information regarding our leases 
our occupancy expenses include costs associated with office space held in excess of our current requirements 
this excess space  the cost of which is charged to earnings as incurred  is being held for potential growth or to replace currently occupied space that we may exit in the future 
we regularly evaluate our current and future space capacity in relation to current and projected staffing levels 
we may incur exit costs in and thereafter to the extent we i reduce our space capacity or ii commit to  or occupy  new properties in the locations in which we operate and  consequently  dispose of existing space that had been held for potential growth 
these exit costs may be material to our results of operations in a given period 

table of contents the following table sets forth our contingent commitments as of november contingent commitments in millions commitment amount by period of expiration thereafter total commitments to extend credit william street program other commercial lending investment grade non investment grade warehouse financing total commitments to extend credit commitments under letters of credit issued by banks to counterparties other commercial commitments total includes our corporate and real estate investment fund commitments  construction related commitments and other purchase commitments 
our commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to counterparties that have fixed termination dates and are contingent on the satisfaction of all conditions to borrowing set forth in the contract 
in connection with our lending activities  we had outstanding commitments of billion as of november compared with billion as of november the increase primarily related to our commercial lending activities outside the william street credit extension program  and such commitments were generally extended in connection with contingent acquisition financing and other types of corporate lending 
since these commitments may expire unused  the total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect the actual future cash flow requirements 
we may reduce our credit risk on these commitments by syndicating all or substantial portions of commitments to other investors 
in addition  commitments that are extended for contingent acquisition financing are often short term in nature  as borrowers often replace them with other funding sources 
with respect to the william street credit extension program  substantially all of the commitments extended are to investment grade corporate borrowers 
with respect to these commitments  we have credit loss protection provided to us by smfg  which is generally limited to of the first loss we realize on approved loan commitments  subject to a maximum of billion 
in addition  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  upon our request  smfg will provide protection for of the second loss on such commitments  subject to a maximum of billion 
we also use other financial instruments to hedge certain william street commitments not covered by smfg 
as of november  we had commitments to enter into forward secured financing transactions  including certain repurchase and resale agreements and secured borrowing and lending arrangements  of billion

risk management management believes that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of goldman sachs 
accordingly  we have a comprehensive risk management process to monitor  evaluate and manage the principal risks we assume in conducting our activities 
these risks include market  credit  liquidity  operational  legal and reputational exposures 
risk management structure we seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial  credit  operational  compliance and legal reporting systems 
in addition  a number of committees are responsible for monitoring risk exposures and for general oversight of our risk management process 
these committees  whose responsibilities are described below  meet regularly and consist of senior members of both our revenue producing units and departments that are independent of our revenue producing units 

table of contents segregation of duties and management oversight are fundamental elements of our risk management process 
in addition to the committees described below  functions that are independent of the revenue producing units  such as compliance  finance  legal  management controls internal audit and operations  perform risk management functions  which include monitoring  analyzing and evaluating risk 
management committee 
all risk control functions ultimately report to our management committee 
through both direct and delegated authority  the management committee approves all of our operating activities  trading risk parameters and customer review guidelines 
risk committees 
the firmwide risk committee reviews the activities of existing businesses  approves new businesses and products  approves firmwide and divisional market risk limits  reviews business unit market risk limits  approves market risk limits for selected sovereign markets and business units  approves sovereign credit risk limits and credit risk limits by ratings group  and reviews scenario analyses based on abnormal or catastrophic market movements 
the divisional risk committee sets market risk limits for our trading activities subject to overall firmwide risk limits  based on a number of measures  including value at risk var  stress tests and scenario analyses 
several other committees oversee various risk  valuation  operational  credit and business practice issues related to our asset management business 
business unit risk limits are established by the various risk committees and may be further allocated by the business unit managers to individual trading desks 
trading desk managers have the first line of responsibility for managing risk within prescribed limits 
these managers have in depth knowledge of the primary sources of risk in their respective markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures 
market risk limits are monitored by the finance division and are reviewed regularly by the appropriate risk committee 
limit violations are reported to the appropriate risk committee and business unit managers and addressed  as necessary 
credit risk limits are also monitored by the finance division and reviewed by the appropriate risk committee 
business practices committee 
the business practices committee assists senior management in its oversight of compliance  legal and operational risks and related reputational concerns  such as potential conflicts of interest 
the business practices committee also reviews the firm s business practices  policies  and procedures for consistency with our business principles 
the business practices committee reviews these areas and makes recommendations for improvements as necessary to mitigate potential risks and assist in achieving adherence to our business principles 
capital committee 
the capital committee reviews and approves transactions involving commitments of our capital 
such capital commitments include extensions of credit  alternative liquidity commitments  certain bond underwritings  certain distressed debt and principal finance activities  and certain equity linked structured products 
the capital committee is also responsible for ensuring that business and reputational standards for capital commitments are maintained on a global basis 
commitments committee 
the commitments committee reviews and approves underwriting and distribution activities  primarily with respect to offerings of equity and equity related securities  and sets and maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that legal  reputational  regulatory and business standards are maintained in conjunction with these activities 
in addition to reviewing specific transactions  the commitments committee periodically conducts strategic reviews of industry sectors and products and establishes policies in connection with transaction practices 
credit policy committee 
the credit policy committee establishes and reviews broad credit policies and parameters that are implemented by the credit department 

table of contents finance committee

new products committee 
the new products committee  under the oversight of the firmwide risk committee  is responsible for reviewing and approving new products and businesses globally 
operational risk committee 
the operational risk committee provides oversight of the ongoing development and implementation of our operational risk policies  framework and methodologies  and monitors the effectiveness of operational risk management 
structured products committee 
the structured products committee reviews and approves structured product transactions entered into with our clients that raise legal  regulatory  tax or accounting issues or present reputational risk to goldman sachs 
market risk the potential for changes in the market value of our trading and investing positions is referred to as market risk 
such positions result from market making  specialist  proprietary trading and investing  and underwriting activities 
categories of market risk include exposures to interest rates  equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices 
a description of each market risk category is set forth below interest rate risks primarily result from exposures to changes in the level  slope and curvature of the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  mortgage prepayment speeds and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
currency rate risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of currency rates 
commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and volatilities of commodities  such as electricity  natural gas  crude oil  petroleum products  and precious and base metals 
we seek to manage these risks by diversifying exposures  controlling position sizes and establishing hedges in related securities or derivatives 
for example  we may hedge a portfolio of common stocks by taking an offsetting position in a related equity index futures contract 
the ability to manage an exposure may  however  be limited by adverse changes in the liquidity of the security or the related hedge instrument and in the correlation of price movements between the security and related hedge instrument 

table of contents in addition to applying business judgment  senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk 
these tools include risk limits based on a summary measure of market risk exposure referred to as var  which are updated and monitored on a daily basis  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equity markets and significant moves in selected sovereign markets  and inventory position limits for selected business units 
var var is the potential loss in value of goldman sachs trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
for the var numbers reported below  a one day time horizon and a confidence level were used 
this means that there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
thus  shortfalls from expected trading net revenues on a single trading day greater than the reported var would be anticipated to occur  on average  about once a month 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days 
the var numbers below are shown separately for interest rate  equity  currency and commodity products  as well as for our overall trading positions 
the var numbers in each risk category include the underlying product positions and related hedges that may include positions in other product areas 
for example  the hedge of a foreign exchange forward may include an interest rate futures position  and the hedge of a long corporate bond position may include a short position in the related equity 
the modeling of the risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no standard methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
we use historical data to estimate our var and  to better reflect current asset volatilities  we generally weight historical data to give greater importance to more recent observations 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
different var methodologies and distributional assumptions could produce a materially different var 
moreover  var calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day 
changes in var between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of exposure  volatilities and or correlations among asset classes 

table of contents the following tables set forth the daily var average daily var in millions year ended november risk categories interest rates equity prices currency rates commodity prices diversification effect total during the second quarter of  we began to exclude from our calculation other debt portfolios that cannot be properly measured in var 
the effect of excluding these portfolios was not material to prior periods and  accordingly  such periods have not been adjusted 
for a further discussion of the market risk associated with these portfolios  see other debt portfolios below 
equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to higher levels of exposure to commodity prices  equity prices and interest rates  partially offset by reduced exposures to currency rates  as well as reduced volatilities  particularly in interest rate and equity assets 
our average daily var increased to million in from million in  primarily due to higher levels of exposure to equity prices  currency rates and commodity prices  partially offset by reduced exposures to interest rates  as well as reduced volatilities  particularly in interest rate and equity assets

table of contents the following chart presents our daily var during daily var in millions daily var chart trading net revenues distribution substantially all of our inventory positions are marked to market on a daily basis and changes are recorded in net revenues 
the following chart sets forth the frequency distribution of our daily trading net revenues for substantially all inventory positions included in var for the year ended november daily trading net revenues in millions daily trading net revenues chart daily trading net revenues as part of our overall risk control process  daily trading net revenues are compared with var calculated as of the end of the prior business day 
trading losses incurred on a single day did not exceed our one day var during 
table of contents other debt portfolios the market risk associated with portfolios in our credit products business that cannot be properly measured in var primarily due to inadequate historical data on the underlying assets in the aggregate is measured based on a potential decline in the asset value of such portfolios 
the market values of the underlying positions are sensitive to changes in a number of factors  including discount rates and the projected timing and amount of future cash flows 
as of november  the potential impact of a decline in the asset value of these portfolios was million compared with million as of november the increase in is primarily due to new investments in the americas and asia 
nontrading risk smfg 
the market risk of our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg  net of the economic hedge on the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying a portion of our investment  is measured using a sensitivity analysis that estimates the potential reduction in our net revenues associated with a decline in the smfg common stock price 
as of november  the sensitivity of our investment to a decline in the smfg common stock price was million compared with million as of november the change is primarily due to an increase in the smfg common stock price and  to a lesser extent  the impact of the passage of time in respect of the transfer restrictions on the underlying common stock  partially offset by the effect of hedging the unrestricted shares of common stock underlying our investment 
this sensitivity should not be extrapolated to other movements in the smfg common stock price  as the relationship between the fair value of our investment and the smfg common stock price is nonlinear 
other principal investments 
the market risk for financial instruments in our nontrading portfolio  including our merchant banking investments but excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg  is measured using a sensitivity analysis that estimates the potential reduction in our net revenues associated with a decline in equity markets 
this sensitivity analysis is based on certain assumptions regarding the relationship between changes in stock price indices and changes in the fair value of the individual financial instruments in our nontrading portfolio 
different assumptions could produce materially different risk estimates 
as of november  the sensitivity of our nontrading portfolio excluding our investment in the convertible preferred stock of smfg to a equity market decline was million compared with million as of november  primarily reflecting new private investments 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold fails to perform under its contractual obligations to us  or upon a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold 
to reduce our credit exposures  we seek to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
in addition  we attempt to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by i entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from a counterparty or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events  ii seeking third party guarantees of the counterparty s obligations  and or iii using credit derivatives and other structures and techniques 
for most businesses  counterparty credit limits are established by the credit department  which is independent of the revenue producing departments  based on guidelines set by the firmwide risk committee and the credit policy committee 
for most products  we measure and limit credit exposures by reference to both current and potential exposure 
we typically measure potential exposure based on projected worst case market movements over the life of a transaction within a confidence interval 
for collateralized transactions  we also evaluate potential exposure over a shorter collection period  and give effect to the value of collateral received 
we further seek to measure credit exposure through the use of scenario analyses  stress tests and other quantitative 
table of contents tools 
our global credit management systems monitor current and potential credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their affiliates 
these systems also provide management  including the firmwide risk and credit policy committees  with information regarding overall credit risk by product  industry sector  country and region 
as of both november and november  we held us government and federal agency obligations that represented and of our total assets  respectively 
in addition  most of our securities purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized by us government  federal agency and other sovereign obligations 
as of november and november  we did not have credit exposure to any other counterparty that exceeded of our total assets 
however  over the past several years  the amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing  due to  among other factors  the growth of our lending and otc derivative activities 
a further discussion of our derivative activities follows below 
derivatives derivative contracts are instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps or option contracts  that derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts  which are often referred to as otc derivatives  or they may be listed and traded on an exchange 
substantially all of our derivative transactions are entered into for trading purposes  to facilitate client transactions  to take proprietary positions or as a means of risk management 
in addition to derivative transactions entered into for trading purposes  we enter into derivative contracts to hedge our net investment in non us operations and to manage the interest rate and currency exposure on our long term borrowings and certain short term borrowings 
derivatives are used in many of our businesses  and we believe that the associated market risk can only be understood relative to all of the underlying assets or risks being hedged  or as part of a broader trading strategy 
accordingly  the market risk of derivative positions is managed together with our nonderivative positions 
fair values of our derivative contracts are reflected net of cash paid or received pursuant to credit support agreements and are reported on a net by counterparty basis in our consolidated statements of financial condition when management believes a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement 
for an otc derivative  our credit exposure is directly with our counterparty and continues until the maturity or termination of such contract 
the following table sets forth the distribution  by credit rating  of substantially all of our exposure with respect to otc derivatives as of november  after taking into consideration the effect of netting agreements 
the categories shown reflect our internally determined public rating agency equivalents 
over the counter derivative credit exposure in millions exposure percentage of collateral net of total exposure credit rating equivalent exposure held collateral net of collateral aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa bb ba or lower unrated total net of cash received pursuant to credit support agreements of billion 

table of contents the following tables set forth our otc derivative credit exposure  net of collateral  by remaining contractual maturity exposure net of collateral in millions years credit rating equivalent months months years years or greater total aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa bb ba or lower unrated total years contract type months months years years or greater total interest rates currencies commodities equities total where we have obtained collateral from a counterparty under a master trading agreement that covers multiple products and transactions  we have allocated the collateral ratably based on exposure before giving effect to such collateral 
derivative transactions may also involve legal risks including the risk that they are not authorized or appropriate for a counterparty  that documentation has not been properly executed or that executed agreements may not be enforceable against the counterparty 
we attempt to minimize these risks by obtaining advice of counsel on the enforceability of agreements as well as on the authority of a counterparty to effect the derivative transaction 
in addition  certain derivative transactions involve the risk that we may have difficulty obtaining  or be unable to obtain  the underlying security or obligation in order to satisfy any physical settlement requirement or that the derivative may have been assigned to a different counterparty without our knowledge or consent 
liquidity risk liquidity is of critical importance to companies in the financial services sector 
most failures of financial institutions have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances 
accordingly  goldman sachs has in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies that are intended to maintain significant flexibility to address both firm specific and broader industry or market liquidity events 
our principal objective is to be able to fund goldman sachs and to enable our core businesses to continue to generate revenue even under adverse circumstances 
management has implemented a number of policies according to the following liquidity risk management framework excess liquidity maintain substantial excess liquidity to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows in a stressed environment including financing obligations 
asset liability management ensure we fund our assets with appropriate financing 
intercompany funding maintain parent company liquidity and manage the distribution of liquidity across the group structure 
crisis planning ensure all funding and liquidity management is based on stress scenario planning and feeds into our liquidity crisis plan 

table of contents excess liquidity maintenance of a pool of highly liquid securities 
our most important liquidity policy is to pre fund what we estimate will be our likely cash needs during a liquidity crisis and hold such excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered  highly liquid securities that may be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity 
this global core excess liquidity is intended to allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive markets 
we believe that this pool of excess liquidity provides us with a resilient source of funds and gives us significant flexibility in managing through a difficult funding environment 
our global core excess reflects the following principles the first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company s survival 
focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows  not just disruptions to financing flows 
goldman sachs businesses are diverse  and its cash needs are driven by many factors  including market movements  collateral requirements and client commitments  all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment 
during a liquidity crisis  credit sensitive funding  including unsecured debt and some types of secured financing agreements  may be unavailable and the terms or availability of other types of secured financing may change 
as a result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis  we hold more unencumbered securities and larger unsecured debt balances than our businesses would otherwise require 
we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities  even though it increases our unsecured liabilities 
the following table sets forth the average loan value the estimated amount of cash that would be advanced by counterparties against these securities of our global core excess year ended november in millions us dollar denominated non us dollar denominated total global core excess the us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered us government and agency securities and highly liquid mortgage securities  all of which are federal reserve repo eligible  as well as overnight cash deposits 
our non us dollar denominated excess is comprised of only unencumbered french  german  united kingdom and japanese government bonds and euro  british pound and japanese yen overnight cash deposits 
we strictly limit our global core excess to this narrowly defined list of securities and cash that we believe are highly liquid  even in a difficult funding environment 
the majority of our global core excess is structured such that it is available to meet the liquidity requirements of our parent company  group inc  and all of its subsidiaries 
the remainder is held in our principal non us operating entities  primarily to better match the currency and timing requirements for those entities potential liquidity obligations 

table of contents the size of our global core excess is determined by an internal liquidity model together with a qualitative assessment of the condition of the financial markets and of goldman sachs 
our liquidity model identifies and estimates cash and collateral outflows over a short term horizon in a liquidity crisis  including  but not limited to upcoming maturities of unsecured debt and letters of credit  potential buybacks of a portion of our outstanding negotiable unsecured debt  adverse changes in the terms or availability of secured funding  derivatives and other margin and collateral outflows  including those due to market moves or increased requirements  additional collateral that could be called in the event of a downgrade in our credit ratings  draws on our unfunded commitments not supported by william street funding corporation  and upcoming cash outflows  such as tax and other large payments 
other unencumbered assets 
in addition to our global core excess described above  we have a significant amount of other unencumbered securities as a result of our business activities 
these assets  which are located in the united states  europe and asia  include other government bonds  high grade money market securities  corporate bonds and marginable equities 
we do not include these securities in our global core excess 
we maintain global core excess and other unencumbered assets in an amount that  if pledged or sold  would provide the funds necessary to replace at least of our unsecured obligations that are scheduled to mature or where holders have the option to redeem within the next months 
this implies that we could fund our positions on a secured basis for one year in the event we were unable to issue new unsecured debt or liquidate assets 
we assume conservative loan values that are based on stress scenario borrowing capacity and we regularly review these assumptions asset by asset 
the estimated aggregate loan value of our global core excess and our other unencumbered assets averaged billion in and billion in asset liability management asset quality and balance sheet composition 
we seek to maintain a highly liquid balance sheet and substantially all of our inventory is marked to market daily 
we utilize aged inventory limits for certain financial instruments as a disincentive to our businesses to hold inventory over longer periods of time 
we believe that these limits provide a complementary mechanism for ensuring appropriate balance sheet liquidity in addition to our standard position limits 
in addition  we periodically reduce the size of certain parts of our balance sheet to comply with period end limits set by management 
because of these periodic reductions and certain other factors including seasonal activity  market conventions and periodic market opportunities in certain of our businesses that result in larger positions during the middle of our reporting periods  our balance sheet fluctuates between financial statement dates and is lower at fiscal period end than would be observed on an average basis 
over the last six quarters  our total assets and adjusted assets at quarter end have been  on average  and lower  respectively  than amounts that would have been observed  based on a weekly average  over that period 
these differences  however  have not resulted in material changes to our credit risk  market risk or liquidity position because they are generally in highly liquid assets that are typically financed on a secured basis 
the global core excess excludes liquid assets held separately to support the william street credit extension program 

table of contents certain financial instruments may be more difficult to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress and  accordingly  we generally hold higher levels of capital for these assets than more liquid types of financial instruments 
the table below sets forth our aggregate holdings in these categories of financial instruments as of november in millions mortgage whole loans and collateralized debt obligations bank loans high yield securities emerging market debt securities smfg convertible preferred stock other corporate principal investments real estate principal investments includes certain mortgage backed interests held in qspes

excludes assets for which goldman sachs is not at risk eg  assets related to consolidated employee owned merchant banking funds of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively 
a large portion of these assets are funded on a secured basis through secured funding markets or nonrecourse financing 
we focus on demonstrating a consistent ability to fund these assets on a secured basis for extended periods of time to reduce refinancing risk and to help ensure that these assets have an established amount of loan value in order that they can be funded in periods of market stress

we seek to manage the maturity profile of our funding base such that we should be able to liquidate our assets prior to our liabilities coming due  even in times of prolonged or severe liquidity stress 
we generally do not rely on immediate sales of assets other than our global core excess to maintain liquidity in a distressed environment 
however  we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent and necessary in a persistent liquidity crisis 
in order to avoid reliance on asset sales  our goal is to ensure that we have sufficient total capital long term borrowings plus total shareholders equity to fund our balance sheet for at least one year 
we seek to maintain total capital in excess of the aggregate of the following long term financing requirements the portion of financial instruments owned that we believe could not be funded on a secured basis in periods of market stress  assuming conservative loan values  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  property  leasehold improvements and equipment  and other illiquid assets  derivative and other margin and collateral requirements  anticipated draws on our unfunded loan commitments  and capital or other forms of financing in our regulated subsidiaries that is in excess of their long term financing requirements 
see intercompany funding below for a further discussion of how we fund our subsidiaries 
our total capital of billion and billion as of november and november  respectively  exceeded the aggregate of these requirements 

table of contents conservative liability structure 
we structure our liabilities conservatively to reduce refinancing risk as well as the risk that we may redeem or repurchase certain of our borrowings prior to their contractual maturity 
for example  we may repurchase goldman sachs commercial paper through the ordinary course of business as a market maker 
as such  we emphasize the use of promissory notes in which goldman sachs does not make a market over commercial paper in order to improve the stability of our short term unsecured financing base 
we have also created internal guidelines regarding the principal amount of debt maturing on any one day or during any single week or year and have average maturity targets for our unsecured debt programs 
we seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally for both secured and unsecured funding 
we have imposed various internal guidelines  including the amount of our commercial paper that can be owned and letters of credit that can be issued by any single investor or group of investors 
we benefit from distributing our debt issuances through our own sales force to a large  diverse global creditor base and we believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity 
we access funding in a variety of markets in the united states  europe and asia 
we issue debt through syndicated us registered offerings  us registered and a medium term note programs  offshore medium term note offerings and other bond offerings  us and us commercial paper and promissory note issuances  and other methods 
we make extensive use of the repurchase agreement and securities lending markets and arrange for letters of credit to be issued on our behalf 
additionally  unsecured debt issued by group inc does not contain provisions that would  based solely upon an adverse change in our credit ratings  financial ratios  earnings  cash flows or our stock price  trigger a requirement for an early payment  collateral support  change in terms  acceleration of maturity or the creation of an additional financial obligation 
intercompany funding subsidiary funding policies 
substantially all of our unsecured funding is raised by our parent company  group inc the parent company then lends the necessary funds to its subsidiaries  some of which are regulated  to meet their asset financing and capital requirements 
in addition  the parent company provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements 
the benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding include enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries 
our intercompany funding policies are predicated on an assumption that  unless legally provided for  funds or securities are not freely available from a subsidiary to its parent company or other subsidiaries 
in particular  many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or limit the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to group inc regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that group inc needs to make payments on obligations  including debt obligations 
as such  we assume that capital or other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to our parent company or other subsidiaries 
in addition  we assume that the global core excess held in our principal non us operating entities will not be available to our parent company or other subsidiaries and therefore is available only to meet the potential liquidity requirements of those entities 
we also manage our intercompany exposure by requiring senior and subordinated intercompany loans to have maturities equal to or shorter than the maturities of the aggregate borrowings of the parent company 
this policy ensures that the subsidiaries obligations to the parent company will generally mature in advance of the parent company s third party borrowings 
in addition  many of our subsidiaries and affiliates pledge collateral at loan value to the parent company to cover their intercompany borrowings other than subordinated debt in order to mitigate parent company liquidity risk 

table of contents equity investments in subsidiaries are generally funded with parent company equity capital 
as of november  group inc s equity investment in subsidiaries was billion compared with its total shareholders equity of billion 
group inc has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness  directly or indirectly  to its regulated subsidiaries  for example  as of november  group inc had billion of such equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in goldman  sachs co  its principal us registered broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs international  a regulated uk broker dealer  billion invested in goldman sachs execution clearing  lp  a lp registered broker dealer  and billion invested in goldman sachs japan ltd  a regulated broker dealer based in tokyo 
group inc also had billion of unsubordinated loans to these entities as of november  as well as significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries 
subsidiary foreign exchange policies 
our capital invested in non us subsidiaries is generally exposed to foreign exchange risk  substantially all of which is hedged 
in addition  we generally hedge the nontrading exposure to foreign exchange risk that arises from transactions denominated in currencies other than the transacting entity s functional currency 
crisis planning in order to be prepared for a liquidity event  or a period of market stress  we base our liquidity risk management framework and our resulting funding and liquidity policies on conservative stress scenario planning 
in addition  we maintain a liquidity crisis plan that specifies an approach for analyzing and responding to a liquidity threatening event 
the plan provides the framework to estimate the likely impact of a liquidity event on goldman sachs based on some of the risks identified above and outlines which and to what extent liquidity maintenance activities should be implemented based on the severity of the event 
it also lists the crisis management team and internal and external parties to be contacted to ensure effective distribution of information 
cash flows as a global financial institution  our cash flows are complex and interrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets and  consequently  we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the excess liquidity and asset liability management policies described above 
cash flow analysis may  however  be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our business 
year ended november our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing activities  primarily in long term debt  in light of the favorable debt financing environment  partially offset by common stock repurchases 
we used net cash of billion in our operating and investing activities  primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for ourselves and our clients 
year ended november our cash and cash equivalents decreased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing activities  primarily in long term debt  in light of the favorable debt financing environment 
we used net cash of billion in our operating and investing activities  primarily to capitalize on trading and investing opportunities for ourselves and our clients  to meet additional collateral requirements at securities exchanges and clearing organizations and to provide additional funding support for our william street loan commitments program 

table of contents year ended november our cash and cash equivalents increased by billion to billion at the end of we raised billion in net cash from financing activities  primarily in long term debt 
we used net cash of billion in our operating and investing activities primarily to capitalize on opportunities in our trading and principal investing businesses  including the purchase of investments that could be difficult to fund in periods of market stress 
we also increased our global core excess  provided funding support for our william street loan commitments program  invested in the convertible preferred stock of smfg and financed the acquisition of east coast power llc operational risk operational risk relates to the risk of loss arising from shortcomings or failures in internal processes  people or systems  and from external events 
operational risk can arise from many factors ranging from routine processing errors to potentially costly incidents arising  for example  from major systems failures 
operational risk may also cause reputational harm 
thus  efforts to identify  manage and mitigate operational risk must be equally sensitive to the risk of reputational damage as well as the risk of financial loss 
we manage operational risk through the application of long standing  but continuously evolving  firmwide control standards the training  supervision and development of our people  the active participation and commitment of senior management in a continuous process of identifying and mitigating key operational risks across the firm  and a framework of strong and independent control departments that monitor operational risk on a daily basis 
together  these elements form a strong firmwide control culture that serves as the foundation of our efforts to minimize events that create operational risk and the damage they can cause 
the operational risk department  an independent risk management function  is responsible for developing and implementing a standardized framework to identify  measure  monitor and manage operational risk across the firm 
this framework  which evolves with the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance  takes into account internal and external operational risk events  business environment and internal control factors  the ongoing analysis of business specific risk metrics and the use of scenario analysis 
while individual business units have direct responsibility for the control and mitigation of operational risk  this framework provides a consistent methodology for identifying and monitoring operational risk factors at the business unit and firmwide level 
recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r establishes standards of accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
two key differences between sfas no 
and sfas no 
r relate to attribution of compensation costs to reporting periods and accounting for award forfeitures 
sfas no 
r generally requires the immediate expensing of equity based awards granted to retirement eligible employees 
however  awards granted subject to a substantive non compete agreement are generally expensed over the non compete period 
sfas no 
r also requires expected forfeitures to be included in determining stock based employee compensation expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of the annual report on form k  significant accounting policies stock based compensation for a discussion of how we currently account for equity based awards granted to retirement eligible employees and forfeitures 
we will adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal management is currently evaluating the effect of adoption of sfas no 
r on our results of operations with respect to awards granted to retirement eligible employees that are subject to a non compete agreement 

table of contents the following table sets forth the pro forma net earnings that would have been reported for each year if equity based awards granted to retirement eligible employees had been expensed over the non compete period and if expected forfeitures had been accrued as required by sfas no 
r year ended november in millions net earnings applicable to common shareholders  as reported  add stock based employee compensation expense  net of related tax effects  included in reported net earnings  deduct stock based employee compensation expense  net of related tax effects  determined under sfas no 
r  pro forma net earnings applicable to common shareholders  in june  the eitf reached consensus on issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  which requires general partners or managing members in the case of limited liability companies to consolidate their partnerships or to provide limited partners with rights to remove the general partner or to terminate the partnership 
goldman sachs  as the general partner of numerous merchant banking and asset management partnerships  is required to adopt the provisions of eitf i immediately for partnerships formed or modified after june  and ii in the first quarter of fiscal for partnerships formed on or before june  that have not been modified 
we generally expect to provide limited partners in these funds with rights to remove goldman sachs or rights to terminate the partnerships and  therefore  do not expect that eitf will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
