these reclassifications had no effect on the results of operations or stockholders equity 
overview we were incorporated in california in  became a public company in and were reincorporated in the state of delaware in february through most of our corporate existence  we provided ics for personal computer applications  including personal computer pc graphics and storage 
several years ago  we refocused our business efforts away from these areas  which we believed had become commodity like in terms of pricing and offered diminished opportunities for sustained product differentiation and profitability 
we have reinforced our commitment to maintain profitability by taking strategic actions during fiscal year and the first part of fiscal year to improve our top and bottom line growth 
some actions we have taken in the past fiscal year include  but are not limited to improving efficiencies by completing implementation of a product line structure focusing on our product lines including analog mixed signal products  embedded products  and industrial products  divesting ourselves of our digital video product line assets to focus on our core strengths  and enhancing operations by moving to a completely fabless business model 
during fiscal year  we completed the outstanding litigation with fujitsu for a net million and enhanced our financial position by obtaining million from a one time cash receipt associated with an amendment to an existing licensing agreement  in which certain rights to cirrus logic were terminated from a prior cross license agreement 
further  we were able to realize a tax benefit of approximately million due to the expiration of certain statutes related to non us tax liabilities 
we did not pay us income taxes in fiscal year and we do not expect to incur regular us income taxes in fiscal year  as we have a large net operating loss nol carryforward to offset tax liabilities for us sourced income 
we do not expect to see the same level of tax benefits from the expiration of certain non us statutes of limitations during fiscal year that we experienced in fiscal year we may incur taxes in many of the non us and non us state tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
over the course of fiscal year  we enhanced our focus on operations and decreased our expenses in research and development and sales  general  and administrative by a total of million when compared to the previous year 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year on a pre tax loss of million 
this benefit was the result of reversals of prior year us federal and us tax liabilities 
during fiscal year  we settled and received million from the settlement of outstanding commercial litigation with a storage product manufacturer named western digital corp 
we received a total of million  after expenses  from two patent infringement lawsuits with ati technologies and nvidia corporation involving graphics patents 
finally  we received a net million related to a transaction with broadcom corporation for certain us and international patents 
further  we also benefited from the sale of certain marketable securities for million 
page of 
table of contents although we continue to defend our patents and investigate the potential for leveraging our intellectual property portfolio  we do not anticipate the same level of benefits we have received in the past to reoccur in the future 
we have directed our efforts to become a leader in digital audio and high performance analog and mixed signal ics for consumer entertainment  professional applications  automotive entertainment and high precision industrial measurement applications 
we offer more than products to over  end customers worldwide through both direct and indirect sales channels 
we target both large existing and emerging growth markets that derive value from our expertise in advanced analog and mixed signal design processing  systems level integrated circuit engineering and embedded software 
end products incorporating our ics are marketed by many of the world s leading electronics companies  including bose  creative technologies  harman kardon  lg electronics  panasonic  philips  pioneer  samsung  siemens  sony  thomson sa and yamaha  among others 
our products include analog and mixed signal products for consumer  professional  automotive  industrial  along with other analog and mixed signal products  digital home audio processors and digital portable processors  commercial audio processors  automotive audio solutions  and embedded processors 
some common items our audio mixed signal products may be found in include amplifiers  avrs  dvd players and recorders  dvd receivers  set top boxes  digital televisions  mp players  game consoles  car audio systems and satellite radios 
the balance of our analog and mixed signal ic components are primarily sold into industrial measurement applications  such as temperature gauges for industrial use  seismic devices for oil field and seismology applications and high precision weigh scales for commercial and scientific use 
we maintain sales  design and technical support personnel in the us and other locations near our customers 
we have strategically aligned our personnel to provide better support to our base of system solution customers  most of which maintain design and or manufacturing sites outside of the united states 
we intend to continue to evaluate our employee headcount in these locations in order to maintain our high level of commitment and support to our customers 
we also contract with third parties for all of our wafer fabrication  assembly and testing operations 
our supply chain management organization is responsible for the management of all aspects of the manufacturing and testing of our products  including process and package development  test program development  and production testing of products in accordance with our iso certified quality management system 
our fabless manufacturing strategy allows us to concentrate on our design strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures  access advanced manufacturing facilities  and provide flexibility on sourcing through multiple qualified vendors

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our operations for each of the past three fiscal years as a percentage of net sales 
all percentage amounts were calculated using the underlying data in thousands fiscal years ended march  march  march  net sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring costs and other  net litigation settlement license agreement amendment patent agreement and settlements  net income loss from operations realized gain on marketable equity securities interest income interest expense other income expense  net income loss before income taxes benefit for income taxes net income loss net sales march  march  march  mixed signal audio products embedded products industrial products video products other products total net sales for fiscal year decreased million  or percent  to million from million in fiscal year net sales from our embedded processor products were up million in fiscal year due to increased revenue from a non recurring united states government project  as well as increased demand for arm based products and our communications related products 
we also saw revenue growth in our industrial product line  of which million was due to higher demand for our power meter products 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in net sales of our video products  as we sold our digital video related product line during fiscal year net sales of our mixed signal products decreased million due to various product mix changes between our digital to analog and analog to digital converters 
net sales for fiscal year decreased million  or percent  to million from million in fiscal year net sales from our industrial products were up million in fiscal year due to increased demand in our seismic business 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in net sales of our video products in fiscal year from the prior year 
the decrease in our video products was primarily attributable to missed design wins due to software compatibility issues coupled with a decrease in sales into the dvd player market  as manufacturers discontinued producing this highly commoditized product 
net sales from mixed signal products declined million due primarily to a continued decrease in demand for personal computer audio components  a market we have de emphasized  while embedded product net sales increased million during fiscal year net sales from our other products declined approximately million in fiscal year from the prior year due to sales related to a discontinued product line in fiscal year page of

sales to avnet  inc formerly memec holdings group represented percent  percent and percent in fiscal years  and  respectively 
no other customers or distributors accounted for percent or more of net sales in fiscal years  or the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in a customer s orders could have an adverse affect on our sales 
gross margin gross margin was percent in fiscal year  up from percent in fiscal year in fiscal year  we completed the sale of our digital video product line assets 
product mix changes and changes associated with selling the digital video product line assets resulted in an increase to gross margins of approximately percentage points 
the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent of gross margin percentage compared with percent contribution to margin in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges decreased by million from fiscal year  which increased gross margins by percentage points 
gross margin was percent in fiscal year  down from percent in fiscal year in fiscal year  we completed the transition of our test operations to outside third party providers 
during this transition  we did not decrease our internal test operations as much as we had anticipated  which resulted in higher internal overhead costs 
this increase in internal overhead resulted in a percent decrease in our gross margin 
further  the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent of gross margin percentage compared with a percent contribution to margin in fiscal year overall  inventory charges increased million  or percent in fiscal year compared with the prior year  mainly due to write down charges associated with video related products 
we continue to see increased lead times from our various fabrication  assembly  and test service providers 
we also have experienced rising costs associated with the increased cost of certain precious metals from our assembly providers 
an increase in procurement lead times  precious metal costs and or decrease in capacity may cause our costs to increase  which may slow our gross margin growth in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased million from fiscal year due in large part to the decrease in expenses associated with the sale of the digital video product line assets in early fiscal year and our cost savings measures from fiscal year research and development expenses  including amortization of acquired intangibles  decreased as a percentage of net sales to percent in fiscal year from percent in fiscal year amortization of acquired intangibles decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the company expects to see an increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year of approximately to million as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
r  which requires that stock options be expensed based upon their fair value at the time of grant 
research and development expenses in fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year primarily due to fiscal year cost reductions and the realization of the full year impact of the fiscal year cost reductions 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from percent in fiscal year to percent in fiscal year research and development expense for fiscal years and now include million and million  respectively  of amortization of acquired intangible assets

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this was primarily due to charges associated with million in loss contingency accruals on certain properties recently sub leased to a third party by cirrus logic during the current year and a benefit recorded in fiscal year related to a million release of a use tax accrual coupled with a refund of million related to recovered non us goods and sales tax 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from percent in fiscal year to percent in fiscal year the company expects to see an increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal year of approximately to million as a result of the implementation of sfas no

selling  general and administrated expenses benefited in fiscal year from a million release of a use tax accrual coupled with a refund of million related to recovered non us goods and sales tax 
further  selling  general and administrative expenses also benefited from the realization of the full year impact of the fiscal year cost reduction efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from percent in fiscal year to percent in fiscal year restructuring costs and other  net during the fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in operating expenses for severance and facility related items associated with workforce reductions related to the sale of the digital video product line assets and changes to sub lease assumptions regarding exited facilities 
this action affected approximately individuals worldwide and resulted in a net charge of approximately million 
in connection with the digital video product line asset sale  we ceased using certain leased office space in our fremont  california location 
accordingly  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to the exit from this facility 
partially offsetting the restructuring charge was million related to the gain on the digital video product line asset sale 
for further detail  see note  non marketable securities 
during fiscal year  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million in operating expenses for facility consolidations primarily in california and texas  an impairment charge of million for technology licenses and equipment that will no longer be used due to our workforce reductions and a charge of million related to workforce reductions 
we expected to realize approximately million to million in savings in annual research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses due to the related headcount reductions and facility consolidation activities 
during fiscal year  we did realize these expected savings as noted earlier in the research and development discussion 
further  as we continue to monitor our operating expenses  facility accruals  divestiture opportunities and space utilizations  we may record additional restructuring charges related to these items
