carecentrix operations provide an array of administrative services and coordinate the delivery of home nursing services  acute and chronic infusion therapies  durable medical equipment  and respiratory products and services for managed care organizations and health plans

gentiva s revenues are generated primarily from three major payer sources the us medicare program  medicaid and local government programs  and commercial insurers 
the medicare and medicaid and related programs are subject to legislative and other risk factors that can result in fluctuating reimbursement rates for gentiva s direct home health services to patients 
the commercial insurance industry is continually seeking ways to control the cost of services to patients that it covers 
one of the ways it seeks to control costs is to require greater efficiencies from its providers  including home healthcare companies 
despite these risks  gentiva believes it can operate effectively in the current healthcare climate by increasing its medicare volume  seeking rate increases from commercial payers and implementing new business practices  technologies and other methods to make the company a more efficient provider of services 
gentiva has made a decision to seek more business from the medicare 
for example  in  gentiva s revenue from medicare increased percent from the prior year 
various states have addressed budget pressures by considering or implementing reductions in various healthcare programs  including reductions in rates or changes in patient eligibility requirements 
in addition  the company has also decided to taper participation in certain medicaid and other state and county programs 
as a result  gentiva s revenue from this payer category declined percent from the prior year 
gentiva believes that several marketplace factors can contribute to its future growth 
first  the company is a leader in a highly fragmented home healthcare industry populated by approximately  providers of varying size and resources 
second  the cost of a home healthcare visit to a patient can be significantly lower than the cost of an average day in a hospital or skilled nursing institution 
and third  the demand for home care is expected to grow  primarily due to an aging us population 
the cms projects that national home health and durable medical equipment spending will rise from billion in to billion by the us census bureau has projected that the age and older population will increase more than percent between and the company expects to capitalize on these positive trends through a determined set of strategies  as follows generate increased revenue by growing medicare volume and improving commercial insurance pricing  continue to develop and expand specialty programs for incremental revenue growth  focus on clinical associate recruitment  retention and productivity  and continue technology initiatives that could make gentiva more efficient and profitable 
the company anticipates executing these strategies by continuing to expand its sales presence  developing and marketing its managed care services  making operational improvements and deploying new technologies  providing employees with leadership training and instituting retention initiatives  ensuring strong ethics and corporate governance  and focusing on shareholder value 
results from these strategies and initiatives are reflected in the company s performance

home healthcare services segment revenues are derived from all three payer groups medicare  medicaid and local government and commercial insurance and other 
carecentrix segment revenues are derived from the commercial insurance and other payer group only 
medicare revenue growth for fiscal as compared to fiscal was driven by several factors  including i an increase in admissions  including the company s specialty programs and exclusive of acquired operations  of approximately percent  ii improvement in revenue per admission  iii reimbursement rate changes  as noted below and iv the impact of the heritage acquisition  which closed on may  and constituted approximately percent of the percent increase in medicare revenue for fiscal these positive factors were reduced by percent resulting from a change in the amount of medicare special items which are described below 
medicare revenue included special items of million for fiscal and million for fiscal special items represented i million recorded and received during fiscal in partial settlement of the company s appeal filed with the prrb related to the reopening of its cost reports  ii million recorded and received during fiscal in settlement of the company s appeal filed with the prrb related to the reopening of its and cost reports  and iii a revenue adjustment in fiscal of million to reflect the estimated repayment to medicare in connection with services rendered to certain patients since the inception of the pps in october in connection with the estimated repayment  cms had determined that homecare providers should have received lower reimbursements for certain services rendered to beneficiaries discharged from inpatient hospitals within fourteen days immediately preceding admission to home healthcare 
the reimbursement rate changes included a percent market basket increase that became effective for patients on service on or after january   partially offset by the elimination of the percent rate increase related to home health services performed in specifically defined rural areas of the country referred to as the rural add on provision effective for patients on service on or after april  the rate adjustments relating to the market basket change and rural add on provision represented incremental revenue of approximately million for fiscal medicaid and local government revenues decreased for the fiscal periods as compared to the fiscal periods  due primarily to a reduction in the company s participation in certain low margin medicaid and state and county programs partially offset by an increase in skilled visits within medicaid programs 
revenues relating to hourly medicaid and state and county programs decreased million for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  while revenues relating to intermittent care visits increased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal commercial insurance and other revenues decreased million  or percent  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily driven by the million decline in the revenues of the carecentrix segment  as well as the impact of exiting certain unprofitable business as the company pursues more favorable commercial pricing in the home healthcare services segment  partially offset by increases in revenues from the acquired heritage operations 
home healthcare services segment revenues increased million  or percent  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal revenues for fiscal and fiscal were impacted by the medicare special items discussed above 
in addition  fiscal and  to a lesser extent  fiscal medicare revenues and commercial insurance and other revenues were negatively impacted by hurricanes in the southeastern united states 
carecentrix segment revenues for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or percent 
the decrease was primarily driven by an million decline in revenues related to the cigna contract due to a reduction in the number of enrolled cigna members in resulting in lower revenues from cigna s capitated plans  partially offset by the addition of cigna members in five new england states  effective july   and volume growth in cigna s fee for service plans

the decline in gross profit margins in fiscal as compared to fiscal in the carecentrix segment resulted from i a positive adjustment relating to a change in estimated costs in fiscal as the company completed its reconfiguration of the home medical equipment network and ii lower margins in the period due to changes in the company s arrangements with triwest 
the increase in gross profit margins in the home healthcare services segment resulted from several factors  including i the favorable change in business mix due to increased volume of medicare business  including growth from higher margin specialty programs  ii increased revenue per medicare admission in fiscal and iii rate increases in medicare and certain non medicare business 
these increases were offset somewhat by increased direct cost of services including clinician wages  benefits and insurance costs as well as costs relating to orientation  training and productivity as the company transitions more of its skilled clinical care to a dedicated workforce 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  including depreciation and amortization  increased million to million for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to million for the year ended january the increases for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  were attributable to i restructuring and other special items million associated with the realignment of the carecentrix operations in response to changes in the nature of the services provided to cigna members and the acceleration of vesting of options ii field operating costs associated with the heritage operations following its acquisition in may approximately million  iii incremental field operating and administrative costs to service increased medicare volume and develop and manage the company s growing specialty programs in the home healthcare services segment million  iv increased selling and patient care coordination expenses  primarily in the home healthcare services segment million and v incremental costs associated with the company s technology initiatives million  as well as incremental costs relating to the hiring of full time clinicians and other personnel

the transfer resulted in a reduction of deferred tax assets  a reduction in current taxes payable and the creation of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
the captive insurance company may have a future impact on the company s effective state tax rate 
prior to fiscal year  the state tax history of certain subsidiaries indicated cumulative losses and a lack of state tax audit experience

the company performed a review of state net operating loss carryforwards and recorded a deferred tax asset of million and a valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal to recognize that certain state net operating loss carryforwards may expire before realization

net revenues for carecentrix were percent attributable to the commercial insurance and other payer source 
on january   a medicare market basket increase of percent became effective for patients on service on or after such date 
this increase was partially offset by the elimination of the percent rate increase related to home health services performed in specifically defined rural areas of the country referred to as the rural add on provision effective for patients on service on or after april  in addition  a favorable change in the fixed dollar ratio formula for receiving outlier payments became effective for patients on service on or after january  outliers represent patient cases which exceed the anticipated cost thresholds established by medicare and result in increased reimbursement 
this change has increased the number of episodes which qualify for the outlier payment

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most critical estimates relate to revenue recognition  the collectibility of accounts receivable and related reserves  the cost of claims incurred but not reported and obligations under insurance programs  which include workers compensation  professional liability  property and general liability  and employee health and welfare insurance programs 
a description of the critical accounting policies and a discussion of the significant estimates and judgments associated with such policies are described below 
revenue recognition revenues recognized by the company are subject to a number of elements which impact both the overall amount of revenue realized as well as the timing of the collection of the related accounts receivable 
in each category described below  the impact of the estimate  if applicable  undertaken by the company with respect to these elements is reflected in net revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
see further discussion of the elements below under the heading causes and impact of change on revenue 
in addition  these elements can be impacted by the risk factors described in risks related to the company s business and industry and risks related to healthcare regulation  which appear in part i  item a of this report 
fee for service agreements under fee for service agreements with patients and commercial and certain government payers  net revenues are recorded based on net realizable amounts to be received in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered 
fee for service contracts with commercial payers are traditionally one year in term and renewable automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated by either party 
under fee for service agreements with certain managed care customers  the company also estimates the revenue related to claims incurred but not reported in situations in which the company is responsible for care management and patient services are performed by a non affiliated provider 
the estimate of revenue for claims incurred but not reported involves applying a factor based on historical patterns of service utilization and payment trends to the services authorized at each of the company s regional coordination centers 
the company evaluates the assumptions and judgments used in determining this factor on a quarterly basis utilizing the trailing months of claims payments  and changes in estimated unbilled receivables for claims incurred but not reported are determined based on this evaluation 
changes in the estimate are recorded as net revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income 
there have not been any material revisions in this estimate for the periods presented in this filing 
capitated arrangements the company has capitated arrangements with certain managed care customers 
under the capitated arrangements  net revenues are recognized based on a predetermined monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the volume of services covered by the capitation arrangements 
net revenues generated under capitated arrangements were approximately percent  percent  and percent of total net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
medicare prospective payment system reimbursements under pps for medicare reimbursement  the company estimates net revenues to be recorded based on a reimbursement rate which is determined using relevant data  such as the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and certain other factors  as well as applicable wage indices to give effect to geographic differences in wage levels 
medicare billings under pps are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over an average patient treatment period 
the process for recognizing revenue to be recorded under the medicare program is based on certain assumptions and judgments  including the average length of time of each treatment as compared to a standard day episode  the appropriateness of the clinical assessment of each patient at the time of certification and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits  have significant changes in condition or are subject to certain other factors during the episode 
revenue is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
deferred revenue of approximately million and million relating to the medicare pps program was included in other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets as of january  and january   respectively 
there have not been any material revisions in estimates of medicare reimbursements under pps for the periods presented in this filing 
during fiscal  however  the company recorded a revenue adjustment of million to reflect an estimated repayment to medicare in connection with the services rendered to certain patients since the inception of pps on october  in connection with the estimated repayment  cms has determined that home care providers should have received lower reimbursements for certain services rendered to beneficiaries discharged from inpatient hospitals within fourteen days immediately preceding admission to home healthcare 
as of january   medicare has not finalized the amounts to be repaid for these items 
although management believes that established reserves  which are included in medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  are sufficient  it is possible that the finalization of repayments to medicare relating to these items could result in adjustments to the consolidated financial statements that exceed established reserves 
settlement issues under interim payment system prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home healthcare services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs were reported in annual cost reports which were filed with cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
although management believes that established reserves related to the open fiscal cost report year are sufficient  it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits could exceed established reserves and could have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these reserves are reflected in medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company periodically reviews its established audit reserves for appropriateness and records any adjustments or settlements as net revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income 
there have not been any material revisions in established reserves for the periods presented in this filing 
settlement liabilities are recorded at the time of any probable and reasonably estimable event and any positive settlements are recorded as revenue in the company s consolidated statements of income in the period in which such gain contingencies are realized 
as discussed further under the heading government matters prrb appeal in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  the company received an aggregate of million during fiscal in settlement of the company s appeal filed with the prrb related to the reopening of all of its and cost reports 
during fiscal  the company received million in partial settlement of the prrb appeal relating to its cost reports 
causes and impact of change on revenue for each of the sources of revenue  the principal elements in addition to those described above which can cause change in the amount of revenue to be realized are i an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation  ii an inability to obtain authorizations acceptable to the payer  iii utilization of services at levels other than authorized  and iv other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
revenue adjustments resulting from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts are recorded as adjustments to net revenues or recorded against allowance for doubtful accounts  depending on the nature of the adjustment 
these are determined by company management and reviewed from time to time  but no less often than quarterly 
each of the elements described here and under each of the various sources of revenue can effect change in the estimates  and it is not possible to predict the degree of change that might be effected by a variation in one or more of the elements described 
while it is not possible to predict the degree of change of each element  we believe that changes in these elements could cause a change in estimate which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
there have not been any material revisions in these estimates for the periods presented in this filing 
billing and receivables processing the company s billing systems record revenues at net expected reimbursement based on established or contracted fee schedules 
the systems provide for an initial contractual allowance adjustment from usual and customary charges  which is typical for the payers in the healthcare field 
the company records an initial contractual allowance at the time of billing and reduces the company s revenue to expected reimbursement levels 
changes in contractual allowances  if any  are recorded each month 
changes in contractual allowances have not been material for the periods presented in this filing 
accounts receivable attributable to major payer sources of reimbursement are as follows dollars in thousands january  january  medicare   medicaid and local government   commercial insurance and other   gross accounts receivable   less allowance for doubtful accounts   net accounts receivable   the commercial insurance and other payer group included self pay accounts receivable of million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
accounts receivable below further outlines other matters considered with respect to estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable collection policy the process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables involves significant assumptions and judgments 
the company believes that its collection and reserve processes  along with the monitoring of its billing processes  help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in reimbursement experience  revenue adjustments and billing functions 
collection processes are performed in accordance with the fair debt collections practices act and include reviewing aging and cash posting reports  contacting the payers to determine why payment has not been made  resubmission of claims when appropriate and filing appeals with payers for claims that have been denied 
collection procedures generally include follow up contact with the payer at least every days from invoice date  and a review of collection activity at days to determine continuation of internal collection activities or potential referral to collection agencies 
the company s bad debt policy includes escalation procedures and guidelines for write off of an account  as well as the authorization required  once it is determined that the open account has been worked by the company s internal collectors and or collection agencies in accordance with the company s standard procedures and resolution of the open account through receipt of payment is determined to be remote 
the company reviews each account individually and does not have either a threshold dollar amount or aging period that it uses to trigger a balance write off  although the company does have a small balance write off policy for non governmental accounts with debit balances under the company s policy is to bill for patient co payments and make good faith efforts to collect such amounts 
at the end of each reporting period  the company estimates the amount of outstanding patient co payments that will not be collected and the amount of outstanding co payments that may be waived due to financial hardship based on a review of historical trends 
this estimate is made as part of the company s evaluation of the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
there have not been any material revisions in this estimate for the periods presented in this filing 
accounts receivable reserve methodology the company has implemented a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on accounts receivable aging trends 
the company analyzes historical collection trends  reimbursement experience and revenue adjustment trends  by major payer groups including medicare  cigna and other payer groups organized by similar type and experience  as an integral part of the estimation process related to determining the valuation allowance for accounts receivable 
in addition  the company assesses the current state of its billing functions on a quarterly basis in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues to determine the impact  if any  on its reserve estimates  which involve judgment 
revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts  which is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
there have not been any material changes in the estimates for the periods presented in this filing 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at january   january  and december  was million  million and million  respectively 
additional information regarding the company s allowance for doubtful accounts can be found in schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts on page of this report 
cost of claims incurred but not reported under capitated arrangements with managed care customers  the company estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported based on applying actuarial assumptions  historical patterns of utilization to authorized levels of service  current enrollment statistics and other information 
under fee for service arrangements with managed care customers  the company also estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported and the estimated revenue relating thereto in situations in which the company is responsible for care management and patient services are performed by a non affiliated provider 
the estimate of cost of claims incurred but not reported involves applying a factor based on historical patterns of service utilization and payment trends to the services authorized at each of the company s regional coordination centers 
the company evaluates the assumptions and judgments used in determining this factor on a quarterly basis utilizing the trailing months of claims payments  and changes in estimated liabilities for cost of claims incurred but not reported are determined based on this evaluation 
each of the elements described above can effect change in the estimates  and it is not possible to predict the degree of change that might be effected by a variation in one or more of the elements described 
because of the elements described above  these estimates may change in the future and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the cost of claims incurred for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
differences in costs between fiscal years relate primarily to changes in business activity in the company s carecentrix operations during the reported periods 
cost of claims incurred but not reported  including any changes in estimate relating thereto  are reflected in cost of services sold in the company s consolidated statements of income 
there have not been any material revisions in estimates of prior year costs related to cost of claims incurred for the periods presented in this filing 
obligations under insurance programs the company is obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including workers compensation  professional liability  property and general liability  and employee health and welfare 
the company may be subject to workers compensation claims and lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims
