the following table sets forth information about us by geographic area net sales long lived assets year ended december  december  in thousands united states foreign operations canada other foreign subtotal foreign operations total us and foreign management information systems we have implemented data processing systems to provide support for a full range of business functions  such as customer service  inventory and logistics management  accounting and administrative support 
our branch information system  known as wesnet  is the primary data processing vehicle for all branch operations other than our bruckner integrated supply division and certain acquired branches 
the wesnet system provides all of the basic day to day order management and order fulfillment functions 
the wesnet application and server reside locally within each branch and provide us with a flexible and cost effective approach to facilitate expansion and organizational growth 
the distributed systems are connected to a centralized data processing center via a wide area network that provides a tightly coupled  yet flexible system 
the centralized corporate information system and data warehouse provide a platform with capability that we believe exceeds many of the most advanced enterprise resource planning packages available on the market 
our centralized servers contain near real time transactional data from each branch system  as well as multiple years of historical transaction data 
the centralized server and data warehouse technology provide a cost effective mechanism to better monitor  manage and enhance operational processes

our integrated supply services are supported by state of the art proprietary procurement and inventory management systems 
these systems provide a fully integrated  flexible supply chain platform that currently handles over of our integrated supply customers transactions electronically 
our configuration options for a customer range from online linkages to the customer s business and purchasing systems  to total replacement of a customer s procurement and inventory management system for mro supplies 
competition we believe that we are the largest distributor in the estimated billion us electrical distribution industry and the largest provider of integrated supply services for mro goods and services in the united states 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry 
we compete directly with national  regional and local providers of electrical and other industrial mro supplies 
in  the latest year for which industry published market share data is available  the four national distributors  including us  accounted for approximately of estimated total industry sales 
competition is primarily focused on the local service area  and is generally based on product line breadth  product availability  service capabilities and price 
another source of competition is buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability 
while increased buying power may improve the competitive position of buying groups locally  we believe these groups have not been able to compete effectively with us for national account customers due to the difficulty in coordinating a diverse ownership group 
although certain internet based procurement service companies  auction businesses and trade exchanges remain in the marketplace  the impact on our business from these potential competitors has been minimal to date 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees worldwide  of which approximately  were located in the united states and approximately in canada and our other international locations 
less than of our employees are represented by unions 
we believe our labor relations are generally good 
intellectual property we currently have trademarks and service marks registered with the us patent and trademark office 
the registered trademarks and service marks include wesco  our corporate logo  the running man logo  the running man in box logo and the extra effort people 
in  two trademarks  cb only the best is good enough and ladd  were added as a result of the acquisition of carlton bates company carlton bates 
certain of these and other trademark and service mark registration applications have been filed in various foreign jurisdictions  including canada  mexico  the united kingdom  singapore and the european community 
environmental matters our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety 
some of these laws and regulations may impose strict  joint and several liabilities on certain persons for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties 
these persons may include former  current or future owners or operators of properties and persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances 
our owned and leased real property may give rise to such investigation  remediation and monitoring liabilities under environmental laws 
in addition  anyone disposing of certain products we distribute  such as ballasts  fluorescent lighting and batteries  must comply with environmental laws that regulate certain materials in these products 
source electrical wholesale estimated industry sales per electrical wholesaling november  based upon us census bureau survey segregating electrical wholesale vs 
electrical retail sales 
electrical wholesaling s estimated industry sales of billion had aggregated wholesale and retail sales 

table of contents we believe that we are in compliance  in all material respects  with applicable environmental laws 
as a result  we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future 
seasonality our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors 
sales during the first quarter are generally less than below the sales of the remaining three quarters due to a reduced level of activity during the winter months of january and february 
sales increase beginning in march  with slight fluctuations per month through december 
as a result  our reported sales and earnings in the first quarter are generally lower than in subsequent quarters

risk factors 
the following factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified by the following cautionary statements our outstanding indebtedness requires debt service obligations that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and could limit our growth and impose restrictions on our business 
as of december   we had million of consolidated indebtedness  including million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes and million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures  and stockholders equity of million 
we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness 
these amounts exclude our accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility  through which we sell up to million of our accounts receivable to a third party conduit and remove these receivables from our consolidated balance sheet 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
our debt service obligations have important consequences  including but not limited to the following a substantial portion of cash flow from our operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for operations  future business opportunities and acquisitions and other purposes  and increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future may be limited  we may be hindered in our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  and we may be required to incur additional interest due to the contingent interest feature of the debentures  which is an embedded derivative 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt  refinance our indebtedness  make scheduled payments on our operating leases  fund planned capital expenditures or to finance acquisitions will depend on our future performance  which to a certain extent  is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  make necessary capital expenditures or meet other cash needs 
if unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
our receivables facility has a three year term and is subject to renewal in may there can be no assurance that available funding or any sale of assets or additional financing would be possible at the time of renewal in amounts or terms favorable to us  if at all 
over the next three years  we are obligated to pay approximately million of which million is related to our revolving credit facility  million in notes payable associated with acquisitions  million related to our mortgage credit facility and million related to capital leases 
additionally  another acquisition agreement contains contingent consideration for the final acquisition payment which management has estimated will be million and is reported as deferred acquisition payable 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
our credit facilities and the indenture governing wesco distribution s senior subordinated indebtedness contain  and any of our future debt agreements may contain  certain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt or issue guarantees  create liens  make certain investments  
table of contents enter into transactions with our affiliates  sell certain assets  redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments  declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders  and merge or consolidate with any person 
our credit facilities also require us to maintain specific earnings to fixed expenses and debt to earnings ratios and to meet minimum net worth requirements 
in addition  our credit facilities contain additional affirmative and negative covenants 
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us 
in addition  our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the debentures  the notes and our other debt  which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt 
if any of our debt is accelerated  we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 
we may be unable to repurchase the debentures or the notes for cash when required by the holders  including following a fundamental change 
holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase the debentures on specified dates or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change prior to maturity 
the occurrence of a change of control would also constitute an event of default under our credit facilities  requiring repayment of amounts outstanding thereunder  and the occurrence of a change of control would also enable holders of the notes to require wesco distribution to repurchase such notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any 
any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions 
we may not have sufficient funds to make the required repayments and repurchase at such time or the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  our ability to repurchase the debentures or the notes in cash may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our debt outstanding at the time  including other credit facilities  which will limit our ability to purchase the debentures or notes for cash in certain circumstances 
if we fail to repurchase the debentures or notes in cash as required by the respective indentures  it would constitute an event of default under the applicable indenture  which  in turn  would constitute an event of default under our credit facilities and the other indenture 
if the financial condition of our customers declines  our credit risk could increase 
in light of the financial stresses within the worldwide automotive industry  certain automakers and tier one mirror customers have already declared bankruptcy or may be considering bankruptcy 
should one or more of our larger customers declare bankruptcy  it could adversely impact the collectibility of our accounts receivable  bad debt expense and net income 
downturns in the electrical distribution industry have had in the past  and may in the future have  an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
the electrical distribution industry is affected by changes in economic conditions  including national  regional and local slowdowns in construction and industrial activity  which are outside our control 
our operating results may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates that may lead to a decline in economic activity  particularly in the construction market  while simultaneously resulting in higher interest payments under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  during periods of economic slowdown such as the one we recently experienced  our credit losses  based on history  could increase 
there can be no assurance that economic slowdowns  adverse economic conditions or cyclical trends in certain customer markets will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents an increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete directly with national  regional and local providers of electrical and other industrial mro supplies 
competition is primarily focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth  product availability  service capabilities and price 
other sources of competition are buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability 
some of our existing competitors have  and new market entrants may have  greater financial and marketing resources than us 
to the extent existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices  we may be required to lower our prices for current services  thereby adversely affecting financial results 
existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions  which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions 
in addition  it is possible that competitive pressures resulting from industry consolidation could affect our growth and profit margins compared to the industry 
loss of key suppliers or lack of product availability could decrease sales and earnings 
most of our agreements with suppliers are terminable by either party on days notice or less 
our ten largest suppliers in accounted for approximately of our purchases for the period 
our largest supplier in was eaton corporation  through its eaton electrical division  accounting for approximately of our purchases 
the loss of  or a substantial decrease in the availability of  products from any of these suppliers  or the loss of key preferred supplier agreements  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials  labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments  transportation disruptions  or other reasons beyond our control 
in addition  certain of our products  such as wire and conduit  are commodity price based products and may be subject to significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control 
an interruption of operations at any of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on the operations of branches served by the affected distribution center 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that particular products or product lines will be available to us  or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand 
such limited product access could cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage 
acquisitions that we may undertake would involve a number of inherent risks  any of which could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result 
we have historically expanded our operations through selected acquisitions of businesses and assets 
acquisitions involve various inherent risks  such as uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  the potential loss of key employees of an acquired business  problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business  and unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition or other transaction rationale 
any one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of businesses or assets 
goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired 
as of december   our goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to million  net of accumulated amortization 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flows to recover the net amount of any investments in goodwill and other intangible assets recorded  the investment could be considered impaired and subject to write off 
we expect to record further goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of future acquisitions we may complete 
future amortization of such other intangible assets or impairments  if any  of goodwill or intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations in any given period 
a disruption of our information systems could increase expenses  decrease sales or reduce earnings 
a serious disruption of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our computer systems are an integral part of our business and growth strategies 
we depend on our information systems to process orders  manage inventory and accounts receivable collections  purchase products  ship products to our customers on a timely basis  maintain cost effective operations and provide superior service to our customers 

table of contents our business may be harmed by required compliance with anti terrorism measures and regulations 
following the terrorist attacks on the united states  a number of federal  state and local authorities have implemented various security measures  including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks  such as the ones that we and our suppliers use 
if security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our suppliers deliveries of the product inventory we need or our deliveries of our product to our customers  we may not be able to meet the needs of our customers or may incur additional expenses to do so 
there may be future dilution of our common stock 
to the extent options to purchase common stock under our stock option plans are exercised  holders of our common stock will incur dilution 
additionally  our debentures include a contingent conversion price provision and the option for a settlement in shares which will increase dilution to our stockholders 
there is a risk that the market value of our common stock may decline 
stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations  and the market prices of companies in our industry have been volatile 
it is impossible to predict whether the price of our common stock will rise or fall 
trading prices of our common stock will be influenced by our operating results and prospects and by economic  financial and other factors

company overview in  we achieved significant organic growth  completed two acquisitions  executed initiatives to reduce cost  redeemed higher cost senior subordinated notes and replaced them with lower cost debt  and increased financing availability under our revolving credit agreement and our receivables facility

sales from our acquisitions  both of which were purchased in the third quarter  were million or approximately over sales 
sales in also benefited by approximately over from price increases which kept pace with rising cost of sales  from favorable currency exchange rates and the remaining from higher sales volume  of which approximately was hurricane related 
sales volume in grew faster than that of our end markets served 
our end markets consist of industrial  construction  utility and commercial  institutional and governmental customers 
our sales to reach these markets can be categorized as stock  direct ship and special order 
stock orders are filled directly from existing inventory and generally represent approximately of total sales 
approximately of our total sales are direct ship sales 
direct ship sales are typically custom built products  large orders or products that are too bulky to be easily handled and  as a result  are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier 
special orders are for products that are not ordinarily stocked in inventory and are ordered based on a customer s specific request 
special orders represent the remainder of total sales 
operating income rose in to million or of net sales  compared with million or of net sales in  due mainly to sales growth  acquisitions and cost containment

in  we incurred million in charges for debt extinguishment related to the redemption of million in aggregate principal amount of our notes

outlook management anticipates that overall economic growth will continue through  and this is expected to lead to increased product demand and sales growth 
our continued focus on margin and operating productivity improvement should produce enhanced financial performance in we plan to use cash flow from operations plus our credit facilities to fund working capital requirements  and capital expenditures to pay down debt  and to fund the cost of acquisitions  if any 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to supplier programs  bad debts  inventories  insurance costs  goodwill  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to reserve items may be required 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized for product sales when title  ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer  or for services when the service is rendered or evidence of a customer arrangement exists 
in the case of stock sales and special orders  a sale occurs at the time of shipment from our distribution point  as the terms of wesco s sales are fob shipping point 
in cases where we process customer orders but ship directly from our suppliers  revenue is recognized once product is shipped and title has passed 
for some of our customers  we provide services such as inventory management or other specific support 
revenues are recognized upon evidence of fulfillment of the agreed upon services 
in all cases  revenue is recognized once the sales price to our customer is fixed or is determinable and wesco has reasonable assurance as to the collectibility in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
gross profit our calculation of gross profit is net sales less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes our cost of the products sold and excludes cost for warehousing  selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization  which are reported separately in the statement of income 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have a systematic procedure using estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibles made at the local branch level and on a consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a systematic procedure is used to determine excess and obsolete inventory reflecting historical data and reasonable assumptions for the percentage of excess and obsolete inventory on a consolidated basis 
supplier volume rebates we receive rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with them 
since there is a lag between actual purchases and the rebates received from the suppliers  we must estimate and accrue the approximate amount of rebates available at a specific date 
we record the amounts as other accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
the corresponding rebate income is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the appropriate level of such income is derived from the level of actual purchases made by wesco from suppliers  in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
goodwill as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating goodwill might be impaired 
this process involves estimating fair value using discounted cash flow analyses 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based on a combination of historical results and current internal forecasts 
two primary assumptions were an average long term revenue growth ranging from to depending on the end market served and a discount rate of 
we cannot predict certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill  which totaled million at december  and million at december  intangible assets we account for certain economic benefits purchased as a result of our acquisitions  including customer relations  distribution agreements and trademarks  as intangible assets and amortize them over a useful life determined by the expected cash flows produced by such intangibles and their respective tax benefits 
useful lives vary between five and years  depending on the specific intangible asset 
insurance programs we use commercial insurance for auto  workers compensation  casualty and health claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses 
our strategy involves large deductibles where we must pay all costs up to the deductible amount 
we estimate our reserve based on historical incident rates and costs 
income taxes we record our deferred tax assets at amounts that are expected to be realized 
we evaluate future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we review tax issues and positions taken on tax returns and determine the need and amount of contingency reserves necessary to cover any probable audit adjustments 
accounts receivable securitization facility our receivables facility  through an spe  sells  without recourse  to a third party conduit all the eligible receivables while maintaining a subordinated interest  in the form of over collateralization  in a portion of the receivables 

table of contents we account for the receivables facility in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
at the time the receivables are sold  the balances are removed from our balance sheet 
the receivables facility represents off balance sheet financing  since the conduit s ownership interest in the accounts receivable of the spe results in the removal of accounts receivable from our consolidated balance sheets  rather than resulting in the addition of a liability to the conduit 
we believe that the terms of the agreements governing this receivables facility not only provide a very favorable borrowing rate but also qualify our trade receivable sales transactions for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles  which requires us to remove the accounts receivable from our consolidated balance sheets 
absent this sale treatment  our consolidated balance sheet would reflect additional accounts receivable and debt 
our consolidated statements of income would not be impacted  except that other expenses would be classified as interest expense

revolving credit facility in march  we entered into a revolving credit agreement that is collateralized by substantially all personal property owned by wesco distribution and its subsidiaries

availability under the facility is limited to the amount of us and canadian eligible inventory and canadian receivables applied against certain advance rates

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations  including interest  at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
to to after total in millions contractual cash obligations including interest revolving credit facility mortgage financing facility non cancelable operating and capital leases bruckner note fastec note acquisition agreements senior subordinated notes due convertible senior debentures due total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents purchase orders for inventory requirements and service contracts are not included in the table above 
generally  our purchase orders and contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation 
we do not have significant agreements to purchase material or goods that would specify minimum order quantities 
management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility and the receivables facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures estimated to be million in and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be or will continue to be the case 
off balance sheet arrangements we maintain the receivables facility  which had a total purchase commitment of million as of december  the receivables facility has a term of three years and is subject to renewal in may under the receivables facility  we sell  on a continuous basis  an undivided interest in all domestic accounts receivable to wesco receivables corporation  a wholly owned spe 
the spe sells  without recourse  to a third party conduit all the eligible receivables while maintaining a subordinated interest  in the form of over collateralization  in a portion of the receivables 
we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates  accordingly  no servicing asset or liability has been recorded 
as of december  and  accounts receivable eligible for securitization totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which the subordinated retained interest was approximately million and million  respectively 
accordingly  million and million of accounts receivable balances were removed from the consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
costs associated with the receivables facility totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts are recorded as other expenses in the consolidated statements of income and are primarily related to the discount and loss on the sale of accounts receivables  partially offset by related servicing revenue 
the key economic assumptions used to measure the retained interest at the date of the securitization for securitizations completed in were a discount rate of and an estimated life of months 
at december   an immediate adverse change in the discount rate or estimated life of and would result in a reduction in the fair value of the retained interest of million and million  respectively 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this example  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another 
inflation the rate of inflation  as measured by changes in the consumer price index  did not have a material effect on our sales or operating results during the periods presented 
however  inflation in the future could affect our operating costs 
overall  price changes from suppliers have historically been consistent with inflation and have not had a material impact on the results of operations 
in recent years  prices of certain commodities have increased much faster than inflation 
in most cases we have been able to pass through a majority of these increases to customers 
seasonality our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors 
sales during the first quarter are generally less than below the sales of the remaining three quarters due to a reduced level of activity during the winter months of january and february 
sales increase beginning in march with slight fluctuations per month through december

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risks approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars and are primarily from customers in the united states 
as a result  currency fluctuations are currently not material to our operating results 
we do have foreign subsidiaries located in north america  europe and asia and may establish additional foreign subsidiaries in the future 
accordingly  we may derive a more significant portion of our sales from international operations  and a portion of these sales may be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our future operating results could become subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we have monitored and will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk at various times  we have refinanced our fixed rate debt to better leverage the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
our variable rate borrowings at december  and of million and million  respectively  represented approximately and of total indebtedness at december  and  respectively 
fixed rate borrowings in we reduced our borrowing rate on a major portion of our fixed rate debt  redeeming million in aggregate  principal outstanding on our notes at  and issuing million of our notes at and million of our debentures at 
as these borrowings were issued at fixed rates  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate fluctuations  although market value would be 
historically  we have used interest swap agreements to mitigate the risk of changes fair value due interest rate fluctuations 
at december   interest rates were within basis points of the coupon rate of the notes and the debentures 
fair value exceeded carrying value of these debt instruments see note  debt 
interest expense on our other fixed rate debt also was not impacted due to changes in market interest rates  and fair value approximated carrying value for this debt as well 
floating rate borrowings we borrow under our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
during our average daily borrowing under the facility was million 
borrowings under our facility bear interest at the applicable libor or base rate  as defined  and therefore we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates
