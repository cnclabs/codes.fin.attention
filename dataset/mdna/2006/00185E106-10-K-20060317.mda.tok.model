item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear beginning on page of this annual report on form k 
our management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
overview apac is a leading provider of customer care services and solutions to market leaders in the communications  healthcare  financial services  business services  travel and entertainment  and publishing industries 
from through  we experienced rapid growth  followed by a decline in business from through during both of these periods  we offered both customer care and outbound customer acquisition services to our clients 
customer acquisition services involve an apac telephone sales representative making a telemarketing call to a consumer to sell a client s products or services 
the principal factors that led to the decline include a reduction in volume from several key clients  industry trends towards offshore outsourcing  and pricing pressures resulting from increased competition in  and regulatory factors affecting  the outbound telemarketing business 
in july  we announced a strategic restructuring to exit the outbound telemarketing business and focus primarily on customer care applications 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are the most important to the depiction of the financial statements and often require significant and complex judgments by us  employing the use of estimates and judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments in these areas based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
the estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
we have used methodologies that are consistent from year to year in all material respects 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  accounting for long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring charge  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for employee benefits and income taxes 
any deviation from these policies or estimates could have a material impact on the financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize customer service revenues as services are performed for our clients 
client contracts generally require that we bill for our services based on time spent by customer service representatives or on a per call or per transaction basis 
time can be billed by the hour or phone minute 
we are generally subject to varying client quality  service level  and performance standards  such as average handle time  occupancy rate  abandonment rate  call quality  and customer satisfaction 
our performance against such standards may provide bonus opportunities  or conversely  may subject us to penalties  which are recognized as earned or incurred 
accounting for long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of property  equipment and capitalized software 
in addition to the original cost of these assets  their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections we make  including estimated useful lives and salvage values 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we record impairment charges on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
any decision to reduce capacity by closing customer care centers or to abandon software may result in a write off of the net book value of the affected assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount by which the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to  the estimated fair market value of the assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of time the asset will be used in our operations and estimated salvage values 
the remaining useful life of the impaired assets will be reassessed and revised if necessary 
goodwill and other intangible assets under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test all existing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment at least annually 
our policy is to test goodwill for impairment as of the end of each fiscal year 
if events occur that would necessitate a more frequent review  we will perform our evaluation for impairment at that time 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we evaluate the remaining useful life of our customer relationships balance at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period 
restructuring charge under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we record a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when a liability is incurred 
a restructuring charge may be recognized for certain employee termination benefits and other costs when we exit an activity 
the amount of a restructuring charge is based on our estimate of severance and other costs to be paid to terminated employees and costs associated with the termination of lease obligations  net of estimated sublease rental income 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a quarterly assessment of the probable estimated losses in trade accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on specific allowances for certain identified receivables and an additional allowance for estimated losses on all other receivables based on their age and on collection history 
accounting for employee benefits we record an accrued liability for group health and workers compensation claims based on an estimate of claims incurred  but not reported  as well as asserted claims at the end of a period 
this estimate is derived from an analysis performed by actuaries we hire who have expertise in this area 
although these estimates are generally reliable  changes in the employee mix and unforeseen events could result in an adjustment to these estimates 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is recorded when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
we record a reserve for tax contingencies until we believe it is probable that the deductions giving rise to these contingencies will not be successfully challenged 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected information about our results of operations for fiscal years ended january   january  and december  fiscal years   and  respectively 
certain additional items of net revenue and cost of services have been included as we believe they would enhance an understanding of our results of operations

the effect of the additional week in fiscal year was to increase revenues and gross profit by million and  respectively and increase operating loss by  means that the percentage change is not meaningful 
non gaap financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap  we use the following measures defined as non gaap financial measures ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income  free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow 
the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with gaap 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our core business operating results 
we believe management  investors and lenders benefit from referring to these non gaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning  forecasting and analyzing future periods 
these non gaap financial measures also facilitate internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by us in our financial and operational decision making 
we expect to use consistent methods for computation of non gaap financial measures 
our calculations of non gaap financial measures may not be consistent with calculation of similar measures used by other companies

we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda plus restructuring and other charges and asset impairment charges 
we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda  in addition to operating income and cash flows from operating activities  to assess our liquidity and performance and believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are of interest to our investors to be able to evaluate our financial results using the same measures we use

the year over year revenue decline was primarily due to reductions in the domestic outbound customer acquisition business of million and the absence of revenue from the rd week of fiscal year of million  partially offset by an increase of million in off shore revenue 
cost of services decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the revenue decline resulted in an reduction in direct labor costs 
in addition  operational efficiencies and the reduction in call center overhead as a result of the july restructuring contributed to the million reduction in cost of services 
the july restructuring resulted in the closure of twelve customer care centers including space located in our corporate offices in deerfield  illinois 
the assets of four of these centers were sold to third parties 
as a percent of revenue  cost of services increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase was due to significantly underutilized capacity and excess overhead expenses during the first half of fiscal year gross profit decreased million to million in fiscal year from in fiscal year due primarily to the reduction in volume 
as a percent of revenue  gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year driven by significant underutilized capacity and excess overhead expenses 
ebitda declined from million in fiscal year to a negative million in fiscal year due to the million decline in gross profit and higher operating expenses driven by increases of million and million in asset impairment charges and restructuring and other charges  respectively 
the increase in asset impairment charges and restructuring and other charges was due primarily to the charges associated with the july restructuring and the million write down of goodwill 
fiscal year asset impairment charges were million compared to million in fiscal year and fiscal year restructuring and other charges were million compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
adjusting for restructuring and other charges and asset impairment charges  adjusted ebitda declined million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction of administrative and support positions as a result of the july restructuring 
we recorded restructuring and other charges of million in fiscal year which included million of restructuring charges and million of other charges 
components of the restructuring charges included the write off of property and lease termination and other costs associated with the reduction of our corporate office space in deerfield  illinois million and the closure of seven additional customer care centers million  and severance costs related to the elimination of administrative and support positions million 
cash charges totaling million relating to the july restructuring have been paid through january  the remaining million of cash charges  primarily related to lease termination costs  are payable in fiscal years through restructuring charges totaled million in fiscal year  partially offset by the reversal of million of prior year charges not utilized

we recorded million of asset impairment charges in fiscal year relating to the write off of unutilized software and telecommunications equipment 
operating loss was million in fiscal year  an increase from an operating loss of million in fiscal year primarily due to a decline in gross profit margin of million  increases in asset impairment and restructuring and other charges of million and million  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
adjusting for restructuring and other charges and asset impairment charges  adjusted operating loss increased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this increase was also primarily the result of lower gross profit margins  partially offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
net interest expense increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due to an increase in borrowings in primarily to fund purchases of property and equipment and severance costs related to the july restructuring 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by the nondeductibility of the million charge for goodwill impairment and the recognition of tax credits in the computation of the fiscal year tax benefit 
fiscal year results of operations compared to fiscal year results of operations net revenue decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  a decrease of million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the decision by comcast corporation  one of our clients  to bring certain marketing programs in house  a reduction in the mortgage servicing business and reduced customer acquisition volumes related to the impact of the rollout of the national do not call registry on october  cost of services decreased million in fiscal year  or  to million from million in fiscal year approximately of the decrease in cost of services resulted from lower direct costs associated with the decline in revenue  while the remaining reduction related to cutbacks in overhead spending  including savings associated with customer care center closings 
as a percent of revenue  cost of services increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year due to lower revenue rates realized per hour of work performed  the effect of lower volumes on certain fixed costs  higher labor costs and spending associated with operational improvement initiatives 
lower revenue rates resulted from price concessions in response to competitive pressures and operational inefficiencies related to certain non hourly paid programs 
ebitda declined from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year due to a million reduction in gross profit driven by the decrease in net revenue and costs of services  partially offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
adjusting for restructuring and other charges and asset impairment charges  adjusted ebitda declined to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year for the same reasons 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  a decrease of million or 
expenses declined from the prior year primarily due to lower employee related expenses resulting from headcount reductions  reduced incentive and overhead expenses and a decrease in bad debt expense 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year we recorded million of restructuring charges in fiscal year related to the closure of three customer care centers  the transition of one center to a client and the elimination of certain administrative and support positions 
these charges included severance costs of million resulting from the elimination of administrative and support positions and million for the write down of property and lease termination and other costs

fiscal year asset impairment charges of million related to the write off of certain software licenses and computer hardware 
we generated an operating loss of million in fiscal year compared to million of operating income for fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to the lower gross profit margins in fiscal year  partially offset by a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses  as previously discussed 
adjusted for restructuring and other charges and asset impairment charges  adjusted operating loss declined to million in fiscal year from adjusted operating income of million in fiscal year for the same reasons 
net interest expense for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year this decrease reflects the pay down of substantially all debt in fiscal year and lower interest rates 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal year compared to in the prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to the non recurring effect of tax credits on taxable income in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth in millions our consolidated statements of cash flow data for the fiscal years ended january   january   and december   respectively 
net cash used provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided used by financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash net change in cash net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of an operating loss in fiscal year of million compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year the million increase in operating loss in fiscal year was primarily due to a decline in gross profit margin of million and increases in asset impairment and restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses of million

a reduction of million in accounts receivable due to lower revenues partially offset this decrease 
net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal year  primarily relating to expenditures for the buildout of additional seats in our customer care center in the philippines offset by proceeds from the sale of the assets of certain customer care centers 
net cash used by investing activities of million in fiscal year was also primarily due to expenditures related to the initial buildout of seats in the philippines and costs to develop ewfm and ewitness 
net cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year primarily due to borrowings under the credit agreement described below  partially offset by capital lease payments 
cash used by financing activities in fiscal year primarily related to capital lease payments 
free cash flow declined million in fiscal year to a negative million from a negative million in fiscal year this decline is due to a million reduction in ebitda  partially offset by a million reduction in capital expenditures 
adjusted free cash flow was a negative million in fiscal year  a million decrease from adjusted free cash flow of negative million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily due to lower adjusted ebitda of million offset by lower capital expenditures of million 
for fiscal year  free cash flow declined million to a negative million 
this decrease is due to an million reduction in ebitda and an increase of million in capital expenditures 
adjusted free cash flow was a negative million in fiscal year  a million decrease from fiscal year s adjusted free cash flow of million 
this decrease is due to lower adjusted ebitda of million and higher capital expenditures of million 
on june   we entered into a loan and security agreement credit agreement with lasalle bank national association  as agent lasalle which replaced our previous credit facility 
the terms of the credit agreement provided for up to a million revolving credit facility that would have expired in june the outstanding revolving loan commitment under the credit agreement was million based on our anticipated cash requirements 
borrowing availability was based on accounts receivable and was subject to certain restrictions and limitations set forth in the credit agreement 
on july   we entered into waiver and amendment no 
three amendment to the credit agreement 
under the terms of the amendment  lasalle agreed to waive certain existing and anticipated events of default under the credit agreement  amend the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement and provide an overadvance facility in an amount not to exceed million 
theodore g 
schwartz  chairman of our board of directors  guaranteed million of the overadvance facility  plus certain costs and expenses 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement the restated credit agreement with lasalle 
the restated credit agreement amends and restates the credit agreement  as amended 
under the terms of the restated credit agreement  lasalle agreed  among other things  to provide us with a million revolving loan facility which expires in october  reduce the interest rates and other fees  amend the financial covenants and release the guarantee that had been provided by theodore g 
schwartz 
our ability to borrow under the restated credit agreement depends on the amount of eligible accounts receivable from our clients and there are limitations on the concentration of these accounts with a single client 
in addition  lasalle retains certain reserves against otherwise available borrowing capacity  including a reserve related to the internal revenue services proposed adjustment to our tax return which is described below 
other restrictive covenants limit our ability to make capital expenditures  incur additional indebtedness  repurchase outstanding common shares  create liens  acquire  sell or dispose of certain assets  engage in certain mergers and acquisitions  pay dividends and make certain restricted payments 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants as of january  borrowings under the restated credit agreement incur a floating interest rate based on the libor index rate or an alternate base rate defined in the restated credit agreement 
the restated credit agreement is secured principally by a grant of a security interest in all our personal property and fixtures 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving facility as well as fees on outstanding letters of credit 
borrowings under the restated credit agreement totaled million as of january  we had approximately million in unused borrowing capacity as of january  in october  we received an million cash tax refund associated with the write off for tax purposes in of our remaining investment in iti 
the internal revenue service has audited our tax return and proposed an adjustment that would disallow this deduction 
we believe that we have sufficient support for the deduction and intend to pursue our available remedies 
on november   we filed a protest contesting the proposed adjustment and requesting a hearing with an internal revenue service appeals officer 
at this point  it is unclear as to how this issue will ultimately be resolved 
although we have not recognized the income tax benefit related to this deduction and have previously recorded a liability for the amount of the refund  should we not prevail in this matter  we may be required to pay some or all of the previously received refund of million  as well as interest related thereto 
the timing of any repayment of the previously received refund could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  require us to seek additional financing to fund the repayment  and result in a default under the restated credit agreement 
our cash flow is significantly impacted by our ability to collect our clients accounts receivable on a timely basis 
to the extent that our business with a single client or small group of clients represents a more significant portion of our revenue  a delay in receiving payment could materially adversely affect the availability of cash to fund operations 
we expect that our cash balances  cash flows from future operations and available borrowings under the restated credit agreement will be sufficient to meet normal operating needs  fund any planned capital expenditures  and repay debt obligations as they come due 
a significant change in operating cash flow  a failure to successfully complete our business turnaround or an adverse outcome in our pending dispute with the internal revenue service could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to comply with the covenants in the restated credit agreement 
and beyond as we move into our plans include the following expanding our offshore capacity in the philippines 
optimizing our current capacity and better leveraging our fixed costs 
the potential closure of at least one additional domestic customer care center 
improving our labor model and compensation programs to enhance our ability to attract and retain quality customer service representatives 
increasing our at home agent program to provide an alternative for those qualified employees that have a need or desire for a more flexible schedule and to improve our ability to manage productivity 
expansion of our offshore capacity will involve capital expenditures  including an investment in the necessary technology 
in anticipation of additional offshore growth  we have leased an additional  square feet in the philippines 
we have also begun to upgrade our domestic customer care centers 
to optimize our current capacity we are currently investing in the deployment of voip technology to support both our domestic and international advanced routing requirements 
we are also currently investing in technologies associated with supporting an expanded at home agent program 
we will continue to invest in both established and emerging call center technologies in order to fully optimize our operational performance and quality 
improving our labor model and compensation programs will ultimately involve an increase in direct labor costs 
we believe that the cost of any such increase will be offset by productivity improvements due to a higher quality  more stable workforce 
due to the nature of certain clients businesses we may experience seasonality of revenues 
in particular  our healthcare industry clients call volumes experience seasonality  peaking during open enrollment and plan initiation periods  typically in the fourth and first quarter of each fiscal year and our business services client experiences peaking processing needs from november through december 
in addition  our ability to anticipate the seasonality of our medicare part d enrollment and customer care program is limited by the fact that there is no history  but ultimately we believe revenues from this program will not be sustained at current levels 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases 
contractual obligations and commitments we have the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments payment due by period thereafter total dollars in thousands contractual obligations operating leases      other commercial commitments telecommunications commitments   letters of credit   training bonds new accounting pronouncements in the fourth quarter of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
if an employee terminates before the vesting period expires  any compensation cost recognized to date for that individual s equity instrument is reversed at the date of termination 
the grant date fair value of share options and similar instruments is to be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
sfas no 
r eliminates the option to use abp opinion no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting 
public companies may adopt the new standard using a modified prospective method or they may elect to restate prior periods using the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  companies are required to record compensation cost for new and modified awards over the remaining vesting periods of such awards 
no change to prior periods presented is permitted under the modified prospective method 
under the modified retrospective method  a company records compensation costs for prior periods retroactively through restatement of such periods using the exact proforma amounts disclosed in the company s footnotes 
we will adopt the standard using the modified prospective method 
the sec rule provides that sfas no 
r is effective for registrants as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  therefore  the required effective date for apac is january  our preliminary estimate of the net income effect of adopting sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method is approximately million to million for fiscal year in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
a conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
this interpretation does not have a material impact on our results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  this fasb changes the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle by requiring retrospective applications to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless impracticable 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued staff position  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
this pronouncement states that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be recognized as rental expense 
we are already in conformity with this new pronouncement 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effect of share based payment awards 
this pronouncement provides an alternative method of calculating the excess tax benefits available to absorb any tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we have until november to make a one time election to adopt the transition method 
we are currently evaluating fsp no 
r item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk historically  we have been exposed to the impact of us interest rate changes directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
from time to time  we have entered into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
we did not have any derivatives as of january  we prepared a sensitivity analysis of our average debt for the fiscal year ended january   assuming a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse change would not significantly increase interest expense 
the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
