as a result of the transaction  the company was relieved of the fee obligations under the license agreement with tst in fiscal of  as well as approximately of obligations related to certain cost sharing agreements between the company and tst projected for the months ending in november the company recorded a loss on the sale of emd assets of or per diluted common share  net of income tax benefit of  in the second quarter of fiscal the company no longer reports emd as a separate segment  rather it reports emd as a discontinued operation with all prior period results of operations set forth herein reclassified to reflect that presentation 
the company  however  has not reclassified prior period amounts in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company reports segment information based on how management views its business for evaluating performance and making operating decisions 
for the periods discussed in this item  msc reports results on the basis of one business segment 
msc s one segment focuses on providing material based solutions for acoustical  coated metal and electronic applications 
msc s acoustical material based solutions consist of layers of metal and other materials used to manage noise and vibration for the automotive  heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac and appliance markets 
msc s coated metal material based solutions include coil coated and electrogalvanized eg products primarily used in the automotive  building and construction  appliance  hvac and lighting markets 
msc s electronic material based solutions consist primarily of coated metal and laminated noise and vibration reducing materials used in the electronics market 
the company utilizes a significant level of shared assets and management across each of its product categories 
it is common for a single customer to purchase products from several different product categories 
the general state of the principal industries in which the company operates presents a number of risks including overcapacity the domestic coil coating market continues to be over capacity resulting in extreme competition in pricing  terms of sale and facility utilization 
uncertainty of north american automobile industry the three largest north american automobile manufacturers have all lost market share in recent years 
these manufacturers represent the company s three largest customers and the continued deterioration of market share could affect the company s future revenues and profits 
pricing and availability of materials the cost of metal substrates continues to increase while availability of metal declines 
the pricing of materials includes the cost of steel as well as  but not limited to  the cost of energy and the cost of petroleum based products 
shift in supply model as market conditions change  shifts in the supply model for certain products may occur 
the company must adapt its pricing strategy accordingly which may affect the comparability of the revenues  operating margins and working capital for the fiscal years presented 
in fiscal  the hard disk drive market shifted its supply model to a toll processing program which excludes the cost of the metal from a package program 
in fiscal  the company shifted the pricing of its gas tank product from a toll program to a package program which includes the cost of the metal 
the company continues to focus on the execution of its action plan to improve operating effectiveness  review the performance  direction and prospects of its remaining product offerings  and consider a range of alternatives with respect to such product offerings in order to achieve greater shareowner value

coated metal materials sales increased in fiscal to  from  in the prior year  primarily due to an increase in gas tank sales partially offset by lower sales of eg materials  building products  lighting materials and other products 
the increase in gas tank sales is principally due to a change in the pricing model to a package basis from a toll basis whereby the cost of metal is now included in the sales price 
the inclusion of the metal cost in the sales price increased sales by  in fiscal the decrease in eg sales is primarily due to the loss of a customer who exited this market 
the decrease in building product sales was primarily due to lower overall customer demand in this market and the decision not to renew a contract for the production of a low margin product

however  as explained earlier in this item  the company has experienced increased costs for both raw materials and energy which has had a negative impact on the gross profit in fiscal critical accounting policies msc s significant accounting policies are presented within the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies included elsewhere in this form k 
while all of the significant 
table of contents accounting policies affect the company s consolidated financial statements  some of the policies may be viewed to be critical 
these policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
management bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of judgments and estimates form the basis for making judgments about the company s value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title msc s value added content in the case of toll processing and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due customers are recognized as earned and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income loss 
the company s revenue recognition policies comply with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
the company also records reductions of revenue for credits issued to customers resulting from manufacturing claims for product defects based upon historical experience and upon specific claims issues as they arise 
any material differences between these estimates and our actual costs are recorded on a monthly basis and are reflected in the historical experience prospectively 
the company had claims reserves of  as of february  a increase in the company s manufacturing claims experience would have the effect of increasing the reserve by long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projections of cash flows on a non discounted basis 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference 
fair value is determined based on market quotes  if available  or is based on valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows 
the valuation techniques utilize certain assumptions made by the company including  but not limited to  estimated fair market value of assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as public market data  depreciation factors for orderly liquidation  including allowances such as dismantlement and removal  and the relationship between replacement cost new and market value based on the age of the assets 
the company has a subsidiary in germany that is currently operating in a loss position 
the carrying value of the subsidiary s long lived assets was  as of february  the sales of the german subsidiary were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the pretax loss on continuing operations was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
management believes  based on current projections  that the operations will generate future cash flows sufficient to support the carrying value of the long lived assets 
consequently  no write down of these assets is necessary at this time 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the actual current tax exposure state  federal and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the assessment considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in future years in which temporary differences reverse in the jurisdiction to which the deferred tax asset relates 
this evaluation is primarily based on the company s historical earnings  projected operating results  applicable net operating loss carryforward expiration dates and identified actions under the control of the company in realizing the associated carryforward benefits 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent the company determines the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
the management of the company periodically estimates the probable tax obligations of the company using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company transacts business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point 
table of contents in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
the company had  of gross deferred tax assets as of february   resulting from net operating loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences  which may reduce taxable income in future periods to the extent the company generates profits 
these assets relate to federal  state and foreign tax jurisdictions  the company would have to generate taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the deferred tax asset exists in order to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets is  as of february  retirement plans 
the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans including the non contributory supplemental pension plans for some msc officers and other postretirement health care plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements entitled retirement plans 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by consulting actuaries using a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate at which the obligation could be effectively settled and the anticipated rate of future salary increases 
key assumptions in the determination of the annual pension expense include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts  results could be adversely affected 
a one percentage point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the net pension expense by and decrease the estimated pension liability by  a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the net pension expense by and increase the estimated pension liability by  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the estimated future return on plan assets would have a relative effect on fiscal net pension expense 
the estimated future return on plan assets for the fiscal pension benefit income calculation is 
environmental reserves 
the company is a party to various legal proceedings in connection with the remediation of certain environmental matters 
the company records these environmental reserves based upon historical experience and the extent of relevant information available from various third parties 
there are a number of assumptions that are made  including  without limitation  the estimated extent of the environmental damage to any particular site  the available methods of remedy  the contribution expected from various other potentially responsible parties prps and the discretionary authority of federal and state regulatory authorities in bringing enforcement actions 
msc believes its range of exposure for these proceedings and known sites is million to million and as of february   has approximately million in its environmental reserves 
accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 which requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage  to be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  it requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facility 
the provisions of this standard apply prospectively and are effective for the company beginning march  the company expects the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows
