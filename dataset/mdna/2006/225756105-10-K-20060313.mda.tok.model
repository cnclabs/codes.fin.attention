item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for additional information on this lease termination 
resort residential development segment ownership structure as of december   we owned equity interests of to in four resort residential development corporations and two limited partnerships which are consolidated 
these resort residential development corporations  through partnership arrangements  owned in whole or in part active and planned upscale resort residential development properties  which we refer to as the resort residential development properties 
the partnerships  for the majority of which we are not the general partner  are responsible for the continued development and the day to day operations of the resort residential development properties 

table of contents competition and market information our resort residential development properties compete against a variety of other housing alternatives in each of their respective areas 
these alternatives include other planned developments  pre existing single family homes  condominiums  townhouses and non owner occupied housing  such as luxury apartments 
these developments focus primarily on the buying power of aging baby boomers 
management believes that the properties owned by crdi and desert mountain  representing our most significant investments in resort residential development properties  contain certain features that provide competitive advantages to these developments 
crdi invests primarily in mountain resort residential real estate in colorado and california  as well as in downtown denver  colorado 
management believes that the properties owned by crdi have limited direct competitors because the projects locations and product offerings are unique  land availability is limited and development rights are restricted in most of these locations 
desert mountain  a luxury resort residential and recreational private community in scottsdale  arizona  offers six hole jack nicklaus signature golf courses with adjacent clubhouses 
management believes desert mountain has few direct competitors due in part to the superior natural surroundings and the amenity package that desert mountain offers to its members 
sources of competition come from the resale market of existing lots and homes within desert mountain and from a few smaller projects in the area 
in addition  future resort residential golf development in the scottsdale area is limited due to the lack of water available for golf course use 
resort residential development demand is highly dependent upon the national economy  mortgage interest rates and home sales 
as the economy showed signs of improvement in  we generally experienced improved activity  absorption and pricing in all regions of our resort residential development investments 
resort hotel segment ownership structure as of december   we owned or had an interest in five luxury and destination fitness resorts and spas and three upscale business class hotel properties which we refer to as the resort hotel properties 
we hold one of the resort hotel properties  the fairmont sonoma mission inn spa  through a joint venture arrangement  pursuant to which we own an interest in the limited liability company  which is consolidated  that owns the property 
we hold two of the resort hotel properties  canyon ranch tucson and canyon ranch lenox  through an unconsolidated joint venture arrangement  pursuant to which we own a interest in the limited liability companies that own the properties 
the remaining five resort hotel properties are wholly owned 
seven of the resort hotel properties are leased to taxable reit subsidiaries that we own or in which we have an interest 
the omni austin hotel is leased to hcd austin corporation  an unrelated third party 
third party operators manage all of the resort hotel properties 
market information lodging demand is highly dependent upon the global economy and volume of business travel as well as leisure travel 
the hospitality market began to soften in early as the national economy went into recession 
in and  the industry experienced declines in occupancy  room rates and revenue per available room  or revpar  revpar is a combination of occupancy and room rates and is the chief measure of hotel market performance 
leisure travel recovered slightly in  but business travel remained weak 
as a result  market conditions were flat in in  not only did leisure travel rise  but business travel increased for the first time since  registering healthy gains in occupancy  room rates and revpar 
was also favorable for the national hotel industry 
in  the national occupancy rate as reported by smith travel research experienced a percentage point increase to  a rise in average daily room rates  or adr  and an gain in revpar 
for the luxury section of the industry  the most comparable to our portfolio  hotel occupancy rose percentage points to  adr increased and revpar climbed 

table of contents competition we believe that our luxury and destination fitness resorts and spas are unique properties due to location  concept and high replacement cost  all of which create barriers for competition to enter 
however  the luxury and destination fitness resorts and spas do compete against business class hotels or middle market resorts in their geographic areas  as well as against luxury resorts nationwide and around the world 
our upscale business class resort hotel properties in denver  austin and houston are business and convention center hotels that compete against other business and convention center hotels 
temperature controlled logistics segment ownership structure as of december   the temperature controlled logistics segment consisted of our interest in americold realty trust  or americold  a reit  which is unconsolidated 
americold operates facilities  of which are wholly owned  one is partially owned and sixteen are managed for outside owners 
the owned facilities  which we refer to as the temperature controlled logistics properties  have an aggregate of approximately million cubic feet million square feet of warehouse space 
americold also owns two quarries and the related land 
business and industry information americold provides the food industry with refrigerated warehousing  transportation management services and other logistical services 
the temperature controlled logistics properties consist of production  distribution and public facilities 
in addition  americold manages facilities owned by its customers for which it earns fixed and incentive fees 
production facilities differ from distribution facilities in that they typically serve one or a small number of customers located nearby 
these customers store large quantities of processed or partially processed products in the facility until they are further processed or shipped to the next stage of production or distribution 
distribution facilities primarily serve customers who store a wide variety of finished products to support shipment to end users  such as food retailers and food service companies  in a specific geographic market 
public facilities generally serve the needs of local and regional customers under short term agreements 
food manufacturers and processors use public facilities to store capacity overflow from their production facilities or warehouses 
these facilities also provide a number of additional services such as blast freezing  import export and labeling 
americold provides supply chain management solutions to food manufacturers and retailers who require multi temperature storage  handling and distribution capability for their products 
service offerings include comprehensive transportation management  supply chain network modeling and optimization  consulting and grocery retail based distribution strategies such as multi vendor consolidation  direct store delivery dsd and seasonal product distribution 
americold s technology provides food manufacturers with real time detailed inventory information via the internet 
americold s customers consist primarily of national  regional and local food manufacturers  distributors  retailers and food service organizations 
a breakdown of americold s largest customers includes 
table of contents percentage of segment revenue hj heinz company conagra foods  inc us government altria group inc kraft foods sara lee corp 
schwan corp 
tyson foods  inc general mills  inc mccain foods  inc smithfield companies inc other total competition americold is the largest operator of temperature controlled warehouse space in north america 
as a result  americold does not have any competitors of comparable size 
americold operates in an environment in which competition is national  regional and local in nature and in which the range of service  temperature controlled logistics facilities  customer mix  service performance and price are the principal competitive factors 
item a 
risk factors we derive the substantial majority of our office rental revenues from geographically concentrated markets 
as of december   approximately of our office portfolio  based on total net rentable square feet  was located in the metropolitan areas of houston and dallas  texas 
due to our geographic concentration in these metropolitan areas  any deterioration in economic conditions in the houston or dallas metropolitan areas  or in other geographic markets in which we in the future may acquire substantial assets  could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and could decrease our cash flow 
for the majority of the past five years  the houston and dallas office markets experienced negative net absorption which resulted in decreased occupancy and rental rates 
in addition  we compete for tenants based on rental rates  attractiveness and location of a property and quality of maintenance and management services 
an increase in the supply of properties competitive with ours in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain tenants in these markets 
our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 
our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets  and consequently the value of our investments  will be adversely affected if our office  resort residential development  resort hotel and temperature controlled logistics properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures 
any reduction in the revenues that our properties generate will adversely affect our cash flow and ability to meet our obligations 
as a real estate company  we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks downturns in the national  regional and local economic conditions where our properties are located  competition from other office  resort residential development  resort hotel and temperature controlled logistics properties  adverse changes in local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand for office space  luxury residences  resort hotel space or temperature controlled logistics storage space  changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants  tenant defaults  zoning or other regulatory restrictions  
table of contents decreases in market rental rates  costs associated with the need to periodically repair  renovate and re lease space  increases in the cost of maintenance  insurance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes  associated with one or more properties  which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties  and illiquidity of real estate investments  which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
we depend on leasing office space to tenants on economically favorable terms and collecting rent from our tenants  who may not be able to pay 
our financial results depend significantly on leasing space in our office properties to tenants on economically favorable terms 
in addition  because a large portion of our income comes from the renting of real property  our income  funds available to pay debt and funds available for distribution to our shareholders will decrease if a significant number of our tenants cannot pay their rent 
if a tenant does not pay its rent  we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and might incur substantial legal costs 
a number of companies  including some of our tenants  have declared bankruptcy in recent years  and other tenants may declare bankruptcy or become insolvent in the future 
if a major tenant declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent  the rental property where it leases space may have lower revenues and financial difficulties 
our leases generally do not contain restrictions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants 
as a result  the bankruptcy or insolvency of a major tenant could result in a lower level of funds from operations available for distribution to our shareholders or the payment of our debt 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is reviewed for adequacy by assessing such factors as the credit quality of our tenants  any delinquency in payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
if our assumptions regarding the collectibility of tenant accounts receivable prove incorrect  we could experience write offs in excess of the allowance for doubtful accounts  which would result in a decrease in our earnings 
bad debt as a percentage of office rental revenue has averaged less than over the last three years 
our results of operations depends on the ability of el paso energy to meet its obligations pursuant to its lease termination agreement with us 
in june  we entered into an agreement with our largest office tenant  el paso energy services company and certain of its subsidiaries  which will terminate el paso s leases relating to a total of  square feet at greenway plaza in houston  texas  effective december  original expirations for the space ranged from through under the agreement  el paso is required to pay in cash to us million in termination fees in periodic installments through december  of which million was received as of december  and is included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets as it is required to be escrowed with the lender  and million in rent according to original contractual lease terms from july   through december  of which million was received as of december  
if el paso does not comply with the terms of the agreement  our revenues will decline  which will adversely affect our results of operations and reduce the cash available for distribution to our shareholders or the payment of our debt 
we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or re leasing space 
we derive most of our revenue in the form of rent received from our tenants 
we are subject to the risks that  upon expiration  leases for space in our office properties may not be renewed  the space may not be re leased  or the terms of renewal or re lease  including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants  may be less favorable than current lease terms 
in the event of any of these circumstances  our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations could be adversely affected 
as of december   leases of office space for approximately million  million and million square feet  representing approximately  and of net rentable area  expire in  and  respectively 
during these same three years  leases of approximately of the net rentable area of our office properties in dallas and approximately of the net rentable area of our office properties in houston expire 

table of contents many real estate costs are fixed  even if income from our properties decreases 
our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our office properties to tenants  renting rooms at our resorts and hotels and successfully developing and selling lots  single family homes  condominiums  town homes and time share units at our residential development properties  in each case on terms favorable to us 
fixed costs associated with real estate investment  such as real estate taxes and insurance costs  generally do not decrease even when a property is not fully occupied  or the rate of sales at a project decreases  or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
in addition  there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to reits that may limit our ability to sell assets 
we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations 
the revenues from our eight resort hotel properties are subject to risks associated with the hospitality industry 
the following factors  among others  are common to the resort hotel industry  and may reduce the receipts generated by our resort hotel properties 
based on features such as access  location  quality of accommodations  room rate structure and  to a lesser extent  the quality and scope of other amenities such as food and beverage facilities  our resort hotel properties compete for guests with other resorts and hotels  a number of which have greater marketing and financial resources than our lessees or the resort hotel property managers  if there is an increase in operating costs resulting from inflation or other factors  we or the property managers may not be able to offset the increase by increasing room rates  our resort hotel properties are subject to fluctuating and seasonal demands for business travel and tourism  and our resort hotel properties are subject to general and local economic conditions that may affect the demand for travel in general and other factors that are beyond our control  such as acts of terrorism 
military actions against terrorists  new terrorist attacks actual or threatened and other political events could cause a lengthy period of uncertainty that might increase customer reluctance to travel and therefore adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 
the revenues from our eight resort hotel properties depend on third party operators that we do not control 
we own or have an interest in eight resort hotel properties  seven of which are leased to our own subsidiaries 
we currently lease the remaining resort hotel property  the omni austin hotel  to a third party entity  hcd austin corporation 
to maintain our status as a reit  third party property managers manage each of the eight resort hotel properties 
as a result  we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the operation and marketing of our resort hotel properties  such as decisions about quality of accommodations  room rate structure and the quality and scope of other amenities such as food and beverage facilities and similar matters 
the amount of revenue that we receive from the resort hotel properties is dependent on the ability of the property managers to maintain and increase the gross receipts from these properties 
if the gross receipts of our resort hotel properties decline  our revenues will decrease as well  which could adversely affect our results of operations and reduce the amount of cash available to meet our obligations 

table of contents the performance of our resort residential development properties is affected by national  regional and local economic conditions 
our resort residential development properties  which include desert mountain and crdi properties  are generally targeted toward purchasers of high end primary residences or seasonal secondary residences 
as a result  the economic performance and value of these properties is particularly sensitive to changes in national  regional and local economic and market conditions 
economic downturns may discourage potential customers from purchasing new  larger primary residences or vacation or seasonal homes 
in addition  other factors may affect the performance and value of a property adversely  including changes in laws and governmental regulations including those governing usage  zoning and taxes  changes in interest rates including the risk that increased interest rates may result in decreased sales of lots in any resort residential development property and the availability to potential customers of financing 
adverse changes in any of these factors  each of which is beyond our control  could reduce the income that we receive from the properties  and adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations 
the amount of debt that we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and our financial condition 
we have a substantial amount of debt 
as of december   we had approximately billion of consolidated debt outstanding  of which approximately billion was secured by approximately of our gross total assets 
our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 
we do not have a policy limiting the ratio of our debt to our total capitalization or assets 
the amount of debt we have and may have outstanding could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements  prevent us from making distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for operations  property acquisitions and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future  require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on our variable rate  unhedged debt if interest rates rise  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  if we need it in the future for working capital  debt refinancing  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes  increase the adverse effect on our available cash flow from operations that may result from changes in conditions in the economy in general and in the areas in which our properties are located  and limit our flexibility in conducting our business  which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt 
our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of  to pay interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness will depend on our future performance  which to a certain extent is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs 
if we are unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  or to sell assets or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that any such refinancing  sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 
if we were to breach certain of our debt covenants  our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately  and  if the debt is secured  could immediately take possession of the property securing the loan 
in addition  if any other lender declared its loan in an amount in excess of million due and payable as a result of a default  the holders of our public and private notes  along with the lenders under our credit facility and certain other lenders would be able to require that those debts be paid immediately 
as a result  any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

table of contents we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt that could restrict our operating activities  and the failure to comply could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under our debt 
our secured debt generally contains customary covenants  including  among others  provisions relating to the maintenance of the property securing the debt  restricting our ability to pledge assets or create other liens  restricting our ability to incur additional debt  restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases  and restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates 
our unsecured debt generally contains various restrictive covenants 
the covenants in our unsecured debt include  among others  provisions restricting our ability to incur additional debt  incur additional secured debt and subsidiary debt  make certain distributions  investments and other restricted payments  including distribution payments on our or our subsidiaries outstanding common and preferred equity  limit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us  enter into transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  enter into certain sale leaseback transactions  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  certain covenants in our bank facilities require us and our subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios  which include minimum debt service ratios  maximum leverage ratios and  in the case of the operating partnership  a minimum tangible net worth limitation and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt have been issued require us to meet thresholds for a number of customary financial and other covenants  including maximum leverage ratios  minimum debt service coverage ratios  maximum secured debt as a percentage of total undepreciated assets  and ongoing maintenance of unencumbered assets  in order to incur additional debt 
any of the covenants described in this risk factor may restrict our operations and our ability to pursue potentially advantageous business opportunities 
our failure to comply with these covenants could also result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our debt 
many factors affect the trading price of our shares 
as with other publicly traded securities  the trading price of our shares will depend on a number of factors that change from time to time  including the amount of distributions paid on our common and preferred shares  the market for similar securities  additional issuance of other classes or series of our shares  particularly preferred shares  or the issuance of debt securities  our financial condition  performance and prospects  general economic and financial market conditions  and prevailing interest rates  increases in which may have a negative effect on the trading value of our preferred shares 
rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares 
of our approximately billion of debt outstanding as of december   approximately million bears interest at variable rates and is unhedged 
we also may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future 
to mitigate part of this risk  we have entered  and in the future may enter into other transactions to limit our exposure to rising interest rates 
increases in interest rates  or the loss of the benefits of any interest rate hedging arrangements  would increase our interest expense on our variable rate debt  which would adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and meet our obligations 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our securities to demand a higher annual yield  which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares 

table of contents in order to pay distributions to our common shareholders at current levels  we may be required to use proceeds from a combination of asset sales and joint ventures  additional leverage on assets and borrowings under our credit facility 
lower occupancy levels  reduced rental rates  increased leasing costs and reduced revenues as a result of asset sales have had the effect of reducing our cash flow from operations 
for year ended december   our cash flow from operations was insufficient to fully cover the distributions on our common shares 
we funded this shortfall primarily with a combination of proceeds from asset sales and joint ventures  proceeds from investment land sales and borrowings under our credit facility 
while we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover our normal operating expenses  interest payments on our debt  distributions on our preferred shares  non revenue enhancing capital expenditures and revenue enhancing capital expenditures including property improvements  tenant improvements and leasing commissions in and  if our board of trustees continues to declare distributions on our common shares at current levels  we expect that our cash flow from operations will continue to be insufficient to fully cover distributions to our common shareholders in and we intend to use proceeds from asset sales and joint ventures  additional leverage on assets  and borrowings under our credit facility to cover this shortfall 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain the current quarterly distribution level on our common shares 
the terms of some of our debt may prevent us from paying distributions on our shares 
some of our debt limits the operating partnership s ability to make some types of payments on equity and other distributions to us  which would limit our ability to make some types of payments  including payment of distributions on our shares  unless we meet certain financial tests or are required to make the distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit 
as a result  if we are unable to meet the applicable financial tests  we may not be able to pay distributions on our shares in one or more periods 
payment of distributions on any class of our shares may be adversely affected by the level of our debt and the terms and number of our other shares that rank on an equal basis with or senior to that class of shares 
payment of distributions due on our common shares is subordinated to distributions on our preferred shares  and distributions on both our common and our preferred shares will be subordinated to all of our existing and future debt and will be structurally subordinated to the payment of dividends and distributions on equity  if any  issued by our subsidiaries  including the operating partnership 
in addition  we may issue additional shares of the same or another class or series of shares that rank on a parity with any class or series of our shares as to the payment of distributions and the amounts payable upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of our business 
we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets jointly with other persons or entities 
as of december   approximately of the net rentable area of our office properties was held jointly with other persons or entities 
in addition  three of our five resort hotel properties  all of our resort residential development properties and our temperature controlled logistics properties were owned jointly 
joint ownership of properties may involve special risks  including the possibility that our partners or co investors might become bankrupt  have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals  be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions  or in opposition to our policies or objectives including actions that may be inconsistent with our reit status  and have different objectives from us regarding the appropriate timing and pricing of any sale or refinancing of the properties 
joint ownership also gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 
in addition  in many cases we do not control the timing or amount of distributions that we receive from the joint investment  and amounts otherwise available for distribution to us instead may be reinvested in the property or used for other costs and expenses of the joint operation 

table of contents we also have joint venture agreements that contain buy sell clauses that could require us to buy or sell our interest at a time we do not deem favorable for financial or other reasons  including the availability of cash at such time and the impact of tax consequences resulting from any sale 
the management and leasing agreements under which we operate our office properties owned through joint ventures may be terminated after an initial period 
we generally manage the day to day operations of our properties held through joint ventures pursuant to separate management and leasing agreements 
under these agreements we receive fees for management of the properties and leasing commissions 
the management and leasing agreements may be terminated  after an initial period of one to five years  by our partners in the joint ventures 
the termination of one or more of the management and leasing agreements would result in the loss of the management fees and leasing commissions payable under such agreement or agreements 
mezzanine loans involve greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income producing properties 
we invest in mezzanine loans that typically take the form of limited recourse loans made to a special purpose entity which is the direct or indirect parent of another special purpose entity owning a commercial real estate property 
these mezzanine loans are secured by a pledge of the ownership interest in the property owner or in an entity that directly or indirectly owns the property owner and are thus structurally subordinate to a conventional first mortgage loan made to the property owner 
we also offer mezzanine financing by taking a junior participating interest in a first mortgage loan 
these types of investments involve more risk than conventional senior mortgage lending directly secured by real property because these investments are structurally or contractually subordinated to the senior loans or senior participations and may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by a senior lender on its collateral 
while we will typically have cure rights with respect to loans senior to ours and the right to purchase these senior loans if in default  an exercise of this right may require our investing substantial additional capital on short notice to avoid loss of our initial investment 
in addition  mezzanine loans usually have higher loan to value ratios than conventional mortgage loans  resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal 
reflecting the risk of these loans  mezzanine borrowers are generally required to pay significantly higher rates of interest than conventional mortgage loan borrowers  increasing borrowers cash flow vulnerability 
in the event of a bankruptcy of the borrower  we may not have full recourse to the borrower s assets  or the assets of the borrower may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine loan 
additionally  we have no right to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings of any senior borrower including the property owner 
while we normally obtain recourse guaranties to protect against a voluntary bankruptcy or uncontested involuntary bankruptcy of the mezzanine borrower and the senior borrowers  these guaranties may not fully cover our debt 
as a result of any or all of the foregoing  we may not recover some or all of our mezzanine loan investment 
in many cases  we do not develop our resort residential development properties and are dependent on the developer of these properties 
some of our resort residential development corporations co own resort residential development properties in partnership with third parties  which are the developers of the properties 
our partner for the majority of our resort residential development properties is harry frampton and his east west partners development team 
our income from the development and sale of these properties may be adversely affected if east west partners fails to provide quality services and workmanship or if it fails to maintain a quality brand name 
in addition  although we have entered into agreements with east west partners that contain limited non competition provisions  at certain times and upon certain conditions  east west partners may develop  and in some cases own or invest in  resort residential development properties that compete with our properties  which may result in conflicts of interest 
as a result  east west partners may in the future make decisions regarding competing properties that would not be in our best interests 
while we believe that we could find a replacement for east west partners  the loss of its services could have an adverse effect on the financial performance of our resort residential development segment 

table of contents development and construction risks could adversely affect our profitability 
we currently are developing  expanding or renovating some of our office or resort hotel properties and may in the future engage in these activities for other properties we own 
in addition  our resort residential development properties engage in the development of raw land and construction of single family homes  condominiums  town homes and time share units 
these activities may be exposed to the following risks  each of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations we may be unable to obtain  or suffer delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these activities  we may incur costs for development  expansion or renovation of a property which exceed our original estimates due to increased costs for materials or labor or other costs that were unexpected  we may not be able to obtain financing with favorable terms  which may make us unable to proceed with our development and other related activities on the schedule we originally planned or at all  we may be unable to complete construction and sale or lease up of a lot  office property or resort residential development unit on schedule  which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs  we may lease  rent or sell developed properties at below expected rental rates  room rates or unit prices  and occupancy rates  rents or unit sales at newly completed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  and may result in our investment not being profitable 
additionally  the time frame required for development  construction and lease up of these properties means that we may have to wait a few years for a significant cash return 
as a reit  we are required to make cash distributions to our shareholders 
if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient  we may be forced to borrow to fund these distributions  which could affect our ability to meet our other obligations 
environmental problems are possible and may be costly 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  we may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate  and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances 
this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release 
the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate properly contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow using those properties as collateral 
the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority  however  of any material environmental non compliance  liability or other environmental claim in connection with any of our properties  and we are not aware of any other environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets or results of operations taken as a whole 
the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the property specific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties 
in general  before we purchased each of our properties  independent environmental consultants conducted phase i environmental assessments  which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling  and where indicated  based on the phase i results  conducted phase ii environmental assessments which do involve this type of sampling 
none of these assessments revealed any materially adverse environmental condition relating to any particular property not previously known to us 
we believe that all of those previously known conditions either have been remediated or are in the process of being remediated at this time 
there can be no assurance  however  that environmental liabilities have not developed since these environmental assessments were prepared or that future uses or conditions including changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or new information about previously unidentified historical conditions will not result in the imposition of environmental liabilities 
if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities  the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

table of contents compliance with the americans with disabilities act could be costly 
under the americans with disabilities act of  all public accommodations and commercial facilities must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the ada requirements could involve removal of structural barriers from certain disabled persons entrances 
other federal  state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to such accesses 
although we believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with present requirements  noncompliance with the ada or related laws or regulations could result in the united states government s imposition of fines or in the award to private litigants of damages against us 
costs such as these  as well as the general costs of compliance with these laws or regulations  may adversely affect our ability to meet our obligations 
our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 
we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties  including insurance for property damage and third party liability 
we believe this coverage is of the type and amount customarily obtained for or by an owner of real property assets 
we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 
our existing primary insurance policies expire on november annually 
in the future  we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices 
in addition  insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses  such as losses due to terrorist acts  environmental liabilities  or other catastrophic events including hurricanes and floods  or  if offered  the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified 
we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property  but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 
if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could seriously disrupt our operations  delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property 
also  due to inflation  changes in codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors  it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed 
events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 
competition for acquisitions and dispositions could adversely affect us 
we plan to make select additional investments from time to time in the future and may compete for available investment opportunities with entities that have greater liquidity or financial resources 
several real estate companies may compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition or land for development and prospective tenants  guests or purchasers 
this competition may increase the costs of any acquisitions that we make and adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations by reducing the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us  and increasing the bargaining power of property owners 
we face similar competition with other real estate companies in our efforts to dispose of properties  which may result in lower sales prices 
in addition  if a competitor succeeds in making an acquisition in a market in which our properties compete  ownership of that investment by a competitor may adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations by interfering with our ability to attract and retain tenants  guests or purchasers  and adversely affecting our ability to minimize expenses of operation 

table of contents acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 
we intend to focus our investment strategy on investment opportunities and markets considered demand driven  primarily within our office property segment  with a long term strategy of acquiring properties at a cost significantly below that which would be required to develop a comparable property 
acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we select for acquisition  we may not be able to integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations successfully  our estimate of the costs of improving  repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be too low  and  as a result  the property may fail to meet our estimates of the profitability of the property  either temporarily or for a longer time  office properties  resorts or hotels we acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy and rental or room rates we anticipate at the time we make the decision to invest in the properties  resulting in lower profitability than we expected in analyzing the properties  our pre acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or necessary repairs until after the property is acquired  which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs  and our investigation of a property or building prior to its acquisition  and any representations we may receive from the seller  may fail to reveal various liabilities  which could effectively reduce the cash flow from the property or building  or increase our acquisition cost 
we are dependent on our key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
to a large extent we are dependent on our executive officers  particularly john c 
goff and dennis h 
alberts  and we also depend on each of the other trust managers for strategic business direction and real estate experience 
provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control or discourage takeover attempts beneficial to our shareholders 
there are certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws that may have the effect of discouraging  delaying or making more difficult a change in control and preventing the removal of incumbent directors 
the existence of these provisions may discourage third party bids and reduce any premiums paid to you for common shares that you own 
these include a staggered board of trust managers  which makes it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board  and the ownership limit described below 
in addition  any future series of preferred shares may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be beneficial to our security holders 
the declaration of trust also establishes special requirements with respect to business combinations  including certain issuances of equity securities  between us and an interested shareholder  and mandates procedures for obtaining voting rights with respect to control shares acquired in a control share acquisition 

table of contents your ownership of our shares is subject to limitation for reit tax purposes 
to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the federal income tax laws applicable to reits at any time during the last half of any taxable year  and our outstanding shares must be beneficially owned by or more persons at least days of a taxable year 
to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification  our declaration of trust  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than of our issued and outstanding common shares or such greater percentage as established by our board of trust managers  but in no event greater than  or more than of any class of our issued and outstanding preferred shares 
we refer to these limits together as the ownership limit 
in addition  the declaration of trust prohibits ownership by richard e 
rainwater  the chairman of our board of trust managers  together with certain of his affiliates or relatives  initially  of more than and subsequently  of more than of our issued and outstanding common shares 
we refer to this limit as the rainwater ownership limit 
any transfer of shares may be null and void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit  or mr 
rainwater  together with his affiliates and relatives  to violate the rainwater ownership limit  and the intended transferee or holder will acquire no rights in the shares 
those shares will automatically convert into excess shares  and the shareholder s rights to distributions and to vote will terminate 
the shareholder would have the right to receive payment of the purchase price for such excess shares and certain distributions upon our liquidation 
excess shares will be subject to repurchase by us at our election 
while the ownership limit and the rainwater ownership limit help preserve our status as a reit  they could also delay or prevent any person or small group of persons from acquiring  or attempting to acquire  control of us and  therefore  could adversely affect our shareholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for their shares 
the number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities 
we have entered into various private placement transactions whereby units of limited partnership interests in our operating partnership were issued in exchange for properties or interests in properties 
these units and interests are currently exchangeable for our common shares on the basis of two shares for each one unit or  at our option  an equivalent amount of cash 
upon exchange for our common shares  those common shares may be sold in the public market pursuant to registration rights 
as of december   approximately  units were outstanding   of which were exchangeable for  of our common shares or  at our option  an equivalent amount of cash 
in addition  as of december   the operating partnership had outstanding options to acquire approximately  units  of which  were exercisable and exchangeable for  of our common shares or  at our option  an equivalent amount of cash 
these options were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per unit  or per common share  with a weighted average remaining contractual life of three years 
we have also reserved a number of common shares for issuance pursuant to our employee benefit plans  and such common shares will be available for sale from time to time 
as of december   we had outstanding options to acquire approximately  common shares  of which approximately  options were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of  with a weighted average remaining contractual life of years 
we cannot predict the effect that future sales of common shares  or the perception that such sales could occur  will have on the market prices of our equity securities 

table of contents failure to qualify as a reit would cause us to be taxed as a corporation  which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 
we intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to meet the requirements for qualification as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  which we refer to as the code 
a reit generally is not taxed at the corporate level on income it distributes to its shareholders  as long as it distributes at least percent of its income to its shareholders annually and satisfies certain other highly technical and complex requirements 
unlike many reits  which tend to make only one or two types of real estate investments  we invest in a broad range of real estate products 
several of our investments also are more complicated than those of other reits 
as a result  we are likely to encounter a greater number of interpretative issues under the reit qualification rules  and more issues which lack clear guidance  than are other reits 
we  as a matter of policy  consult with outside tax counsel in structuring our new investments in an effort to satisfy the reit qualification rules 
we must meet the requirements of the code in order to qualify as a reit now and in the future  so it is possible that we will not continue to qualify as a reit in the future 
the laws and regulations governing federal income taxation are the subject of frequent review and amendment  and proposed or contemplated changes in the laws or regulations may affect our ability to qualify as a reit and the manner in which we conduct our business 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to our shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
in addition to these taxes  we may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax 
unless we are entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following any year during which we were first disqualified 
therefore  if we lose our reit status  we could be required to pay significant income taxes  which would reduce our funds available for investments or for distributions to our shareholders 
this would likely adversely affect the value of your investment in us 
in addition  we would no longer be required by law or our operating agreements to make any distributions to our shareholders 
the lower tax rate on dividends from regular corporations may cause investors to prefer to hold stock in regular corporations instead of reits 
on may   the president signed into law the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  which we refer to as the act 
under the act  the current maximum tax rate on the long term capital gains of non corporate taxpayers is reduced to for the tax years beginning on or before december  the act also reduced the tax rate on qualified dividend income to the maximum capital gains rate 
because  as a reit  we are not generally subject to tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gains distributed to our shareholders  our distributions are not generally eligible for this new tax rate on dividends 
as a result  the non capital gain portion of our reit distributions generally continues to be taxed at the higher tax rates applicable to ordinary income 
without further legislation  the maximum tax rate on long term capital gains will revert to in  and dividends will again be subject to tax at ordinary rates
