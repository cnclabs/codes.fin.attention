critical accounting policies the following explains our most critical accounting policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements set forth on pages to of this form k for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
time and materials contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate 
revenue is earned when our consultants are working on projects 
revenue recognition is negatively impacted by holidays and consultant vacation and sick days 
we also have fixed price arrangements with certain customers 
a price for an entire project is agreed upon for a predetermined fee before the project starts 
we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
we prepare a budget for each fixed price project  and based upon the budget that we prepare  we estimate what our costs should be 
we determine performance by comparing the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
we recognize revenue based upon costs incurred by our consultants during the period 
if our estimates indicate a loss on a particular fixed price contract  we record a provision for the estimated loss without regard to the stage of completion 
changes in job performance  conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the changes are identified 
certain contracts with no stated deliverables  with a designated workforce assigned  recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
revenue on these contracts is ratable and predetermined based upon the negotiated contract 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts we extend credit to clients based upon management s assessment of their creditworthiness 
the majority of our revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from fortune companies and major systems integrators 
unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed in accordance with the terms of client contracts that will be invoiced in subsequent periods 
we review accounts receivable periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible  as well as judgments made by us based upon historical and expected charge off 
table of contents experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be necessary  which may impact earnings 
investments the company accounts for its investments in marketable equity securities in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
the company has determined that certain of its investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  utilizing the investments closing price at each reporting period 
these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with the unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive loss 
the unrealized gain or loss is the difference between the company s original cost for an investment and the investment s fair value at each reporting period 
realized gains or losses on securities sold are calculated using the specific identification method 
if management determines that an investment in available for sale securities has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value  by a charge to earnings 
such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that are considered by the company in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the financial condition of the investee  and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
in evaluating these factors above  management presumes a decline in value to be other than temporary if the market price of the security is or more below the investment s cost basis for a period of six months or more the criteria 
however  the presumption of an other than temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature eg  strong operating performance of investee  historical volatility of investee  etc additionally  there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the criteria is not satisfied eg  plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below the company s cost basis 
during  the company incurred impairment losses deemed to be other than temporary 
these impairments are disclosed in note no such impairment losses were incurred in or for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements  etc 
in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs all quantitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
in  the company recorded an impairment of million on its investment in concours  inc there were no impairments recorded in goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually or as triggering events occur 
in making this assessment  we rely on a combination of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated cash flows and our current market value 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analyses of goodwill impairment 
under sfas  goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair values of reporting units underlying the segments were estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology  recent comparable transactions or a combination thereof 
for further discussions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents stock based compensation at december   the company had three stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  gives companies the option to adopt the fair value method for expense recognition of employee stock options or to continue to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method  as outlined under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
the company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options and discloses the pro forma effect as if the fair value method had been applied in note the following table illustrates the effect on net loss per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock based employee compensation year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income loss  as reported add deferred compensation expense reported in earnings less total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards and deferred compensation expense pro forma net income loss earnings loss per share basic and diluted as reported pro forma income taxes we record an estimated liability for income and other taxes based on what we determine will likely be paid in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters  including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions  and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the amount recorded 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years  we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding increase or charge to income 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb no 
r  share based payment 
fasb no 
r requires employers to value share based payments using the fair value method  eliminating the option to use the intrinsic method to value such payments 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r prospectively beginning in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the effect of the provision of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of sfas fin clarifies that 
table of contents the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated  even if conditional on a future event 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections as amended fasb 
this statement replaces apb opinion no

this statement shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  this statement does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of this statement 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
all of the estimates that we make in preparing our financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which could impact our earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk short term investments are invested in highly liquid securities such as money market funds and certain corporate bonds with maturities of one year or less  and marketable equity securities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
part of this portfolio includes minority equity investments in several publicly traded companies  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
we have also invested in one privately held company airweb  which can still be considered in the development stage 
this type of investment has an inherent risk as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire remaining investment in this company 
the company s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation 
foreign currency risk exists by nature of the company s global operations 
the company sells its services in a number of locations around the world  and hence foreign currency risk is diversified 
when appropriate  the company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions 
these actions may include entering into forward contracts to hedge existing exposures 
the instrument is used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposure 
substantially all of the company s foreign affiliates financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
accordingly  exposure to exchange risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not material
