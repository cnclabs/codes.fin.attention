the company s revenues are derived by selling its products to distributors  who in turn sell the product through to retailers and consumers 
the better beer category  which includes imported beers and craft beers  has seen high single digit compounded annual growth over the past ten years 
defining factors for better beer include superior quality  image and taste  supported by appropriate pricing 
the company believes that the better beer category is positioned to increase market share as consumers continue to trade up in taste and quality 
in  growth of the craft beer category was approximately  and the better beer category grew by mid single digits while the total beer category remained relatively flat 
the better beer category now comprises approximately of domestic beer consumption 
the company believes that significant opportunity to gain market share continues to exist in the better beer category 
in  the company is targeting depletions growth to be in line with the craft beer category depletions growth 
the company s pricing plans include an overall increase which may be more difficult to achieve than in the past few years  given the current pricing environment

based on these assumptions  earnings per diluted share are expected to be between and  absent any significant change in currently planned levels of brand support and before accounting for the impact of the adoption of fasb r  share based compensation 
the company estimates that the adoption of fasb r will reduce earnings per diluted share by between approximately and in this impact will depend on the vesting of certain performance based options 
the company s ability to achieve this type of earnings growth in is dependent on its ability to achieve challenging targets for volume  pricing and costs

this estimate could change based on the actual production capacity and capability built 
the company continually evaluates the best way to utilize its cash balances  and absent significant capital needs for its production strategy  expects to continue the stock repurchase program within the parameters authorized by the board of directors

the better beer category is highly competitive due to the large number of regional craft and specialty brewers and the brewers of imported beers who distribute similar products that have similar pricing and target consumers 
the company believes that its pricing is appropriate given the quality and reputation of its core brands  while realizing that economic pricing pressures may affect future pricing levels 
certain major domestic brewers have also developed niche brands to compete within the better beer category and have acquired interests in craft beers or importation rights to foreign brands 
import brewers and major domestic brewers are able to compete more aggressively than the company  as they have substantially greater resources  marketing strength and distribution networks than the company 
the company anticipates craft beer competition increasing as craft brewers have benefited from a couple of years of healthy growth and are looking to maintain these trends 
the company also increasingly competes with wine and spirits companies  some of which have significantly greater resources than the company 
this competitive environment may affect the company s overall performance within the better beer category 
as the market matures and the better beer category continues to consolidate  the company believes that companies that are well positioned in terms of brand equity  marketing and distribution will have greater success than those who do not

the company believes that a ownership strategy could potentially produce some improvement in operating and freight costs 
this estimate could change based on the actual production capacity and capability built 
the company continually evaluates these factors and others in its evaluation of ownership versus contracting 
the company believes that it has secured sufficient alternatives in the event that production at any of its contract brewing locations is interrupted or discontinued  however  the company may not be able to maintain its current economics if such disruption were to occur 
management is currently aware of some impending issues at its contract breweries that could preclude normal production 
these include the eden brewery operating without the renewal of its union contract for several months  and concerns about financial issues at the rochester brewery 
the company is working with these breweries to attempt to minimize any potential disruptions 
the company continues to brew its samuel adams boston lager at each of its brewing facilities  but at any particular time may rely on only one supplier for its products other than samuel adams boston lager 
the company believes that it has sufficient capacity options that would allow for a shift in production locations if necessary  although it is unable to quantify any additional costs  capital or operating  if any  that it might incur in securing access to such capacity 
in the event of a labor dispute  governmental action  a sudden closure of one of the contract breweries or other events that would prevent either the cincinnati brewery or any of the contract breweries from producing the company s beer  management believes that it would be able to shift production between breweries so as to meet demand for its beer

the total value of the contracts entered into as of december   which are denominated in euros  was million 
the company has no forward exchange contracts in place as of december  and currently intends to purchase future hops using the exchange rate at the time of purchase 
the contract agreements were deemed necessary in order to bring hops inventory levels and purchase commitments into balance with the company s current brewing volume and hops usage forecasts 
in addition  these new contracts enabled the company to secure its position for future supply with hops vendors in the face of some competitive buying activity 
the computation of the excess inventory required management to make certain assumptions regarding future sales growth  product mix  cancellation costs and supply  among others 
actual results may materially differ from management s estimates 
the company continues to manage inventory levels and purchase commitments in an effort to maximize utilization of hops on hand and hops under commitment 
the company s accounting policy for hops inventory and purchase commitments is to recognize a loss by establishing a reserve to the extent inventory levels and commitments exceed forecasted needs as determined by the company s brewing department 
the company will continue to manage hops inventory and contract levels 
the current levels are deemed adequate  based upon foreseeable future brewing requirements 
however  changes in management s assumptions regarding future sales growth  product mix  and hops market conditions could result in future material losses
