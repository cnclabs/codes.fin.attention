item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors including  but not limited to  those under business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 

table of contents overview we are a leading outsourcer of web based account presentation  payment and relationship management services to financial services providers nationwide 
our services  branded in the clients name  integrate seamlessly into a single vendor  end to end solution  supported by customer care  targeted consumer marketing  training and other network and technical professional products and services 
the company currently operates in two business segments banking and card 
registered end users using account presentation  bill payment or both  are the major drivers of our revenues 
exclusive of the users obtained in the acquisition of incurrent  from december  through december   the number of users using our account presentation services increased  and the number of users using our payment services increased  for an overall increase in users 
while we have seen some reduction in average monthly recurring revenue per user  due largely to our decisions to fix price the account presentation service to our clients and offer volume based bill payment price reductions  this has been offset by a decline in the average monthly recurring cost per user  thereby improving our gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  and it increased to for the year ended december  we have long term service contracts with our financial services provider clients 
the majority of our revenues are recurring  though these contracts also provide for implementation  set up and other non recurring fees 
account presentation services revenues are based on either a monthly license fee  allowing our financial institution clients to register an unlimited number of customers  or a monthly fee for each registered customer 
payment services revenues are based on either a monthly fee for each customer enrolled  a fee per executed transaction  or a combination of both 
our clients pay nearly all of our fees and then determine if or how they want to pass these costs on to their users 
they typically provide account presentation services to users free of charge  as they derive significant potential benefits including account retention  delivery and paper cost savings  account consolidation and cross selling of other products 
as of december  approximately of our clients were charging their users for providing payment services 
as a network based service provider  we have made substantial up front investments in infrastructure  particularly for our proprietary systems 
while we continue to incur ongoing development and maintenance costs  we believe the infrastructure we have built provides us with significant operating leverage 
in we began an effort to upgrade and rewrite certain of our applications infrastructure that will continue into we expect that this effort will require incremental capital expenditures  primarily for additional development labor  of between million and million over that period 
we continue to automate processes and develop applications that allow us to make only small increases in labor and other operating costs relative to increases in customers and transactions 
we believe our financial and operating performance will be based primarily on our ability to leverage additional end users and transactions over this relatively fixed cost base 
critical accounting policies and estimates the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our annual audited consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition policy 
we generate revenues from service fees  professional services  and other supporting services 
many of our contracts consist of multiple deliverables that require more than one unit of accounting  and these contracts are accounted for according to emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

under eitf no 
 we allocate revenues in arrangements with multiple deliverables to each qualifying separate unit of accounting based on either their relative fair values or the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair value is determined by the prices charged when the element is sold separately or other vendor specific objective evidence 

table of contents service fees are primarily composed of three business lines  account presentation services  payment services and relationship management services 
revenues from service fees include new user registration fees  account access fees  transaction fees  customer service fees and relationship marketing support fees 
revenues from service fees are recognized over the term of the contract as the services are provided 
we collect funds from end users and aggregate them in clearing accounts  which are not included on our consolidated balance sheets  as we do not have ownership of these funds 
for certain transactions  funds may remain in the clearing accounts until a payment check is deposited or other payment transmission is accepted by the receiving merchant 
we earn interest on these funds for the period they remain in the clearing accounts 
this interest totaled  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
professional services revenues consist of implementation fees associated with the linking of our financial institution clients to our quotiensm e financial suite through various networks  web development and hosting fees  training fees  communication services and the sales of software licenses and related support

 and recognize the revenues related to software license fees using the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion is measured by the percentage of labor effort incurred to date to estimated total labor effort to complete delivery of the software license 
the amount of revenues allocated to each element of a software sale are based on the fair value of undelivered elements based on prices charged when the elements are sold separately 
the revenues related to the support of a software license are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support agreement 
other revenues consist of service fees associated with enhanced third party solutions and termination fees 
service fees for enhanced third party solutions include fully integrated bill payment and account retrieval through intuit s quicken  check ordering  inter institution funds transfer  account aggregation and check imaging 
revenues from these service fees are recognized over the term of the contract as the services are provided 
termination fees are recognized upon termination of a contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the provision for losses on accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts are recognized based on our estimate  which considers our historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data and financial health of specific customers 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  this represents management s estimate of the probable losses in the accounts receivable balance at december  while the allowance for doubtful accounts and the provision for losses on accounts receivable depend to a large degree on future conditions  management does not forecast significant adverse developments in we incurred approximately  of bad debt expense in income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax net operating loss carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when such amounts are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of total deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce such deferred tax assets to amounts more likely than not to be ultimately realized 
prior to december   we maintained a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset resulting primarily from our net operating loss carryforwards  since the likelihood of the realization of that asset had not become more likely than not as of those balance sheet dates 
at december   we determined that our 
table of contents recent experience generating taxable income balanced against our history of losses  along with our projection of future taxable income  constituted significant positive evidence for partial realization of the deferred tax asset and  therefore  partial release of the valuation allowance against that asset 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we released valuation allowance against million of our total million net operating loss carryforwards  creating a million deferred tax asset as of december  and a million benefit to our earnings for the year ended december  at one or more future dates  if sufficient positive evidence exists that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realized with respect to the remaining net operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax asset  we will release the remaining valuation allowance  realize the remaining deferred tax asset and report the associated benefit to our earnings in the appropriate period 
cost of internal use software and computer software to be sold 
we capitalize the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop no 

capitalized computer software costs consist primarily of payroll related and consulting costs incurred during the development stage 
we expense costs related to preliminary project assessments  research and development  re engineering  training and application maintenance as they are incurred 
capitalized software costs are being depreciated on a straight line basis over a period of three years upon being placed in service 
we capitalize the cost of computer software to be sold according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas no 

software development costs are capitalized beginning when a product s technological feasibility has been established by completion of a working model of the product and ending when a product is ready for general release to customers 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

under these provisions  we assess the recoverability of these types of assets at least annually and when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
we use the fair value method to assess the recoverability of our goodwill and have two reporting units  banking and card 
we use the undiscounted cash flows method  when needed  to assess the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets and the discounted cash flows method  at least annually  to assess the recoverability of our goodwill 
we did not incur any impairment charges for the years ended december   or future impairment assessments could result in impairment charges that would reduce the carrying values of these assets 
recently issued pronouncement 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
 and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative upon adopting sfas no 
r 
the company will adopt sfas no 
r on january  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods i 
a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
ii 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures for either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company will implement sfas no 
r in the first quarter of and intends to use the modified prospective method

we currently believe that cash on hand  investments and the cash we expect to generate from operations will be sufficient to meet our current anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to have additional cash requirements over the next year because of efforts we are undertaking to upgrade and rewrite certain of our infrastructure applications 
we forecast that all incremental expenses related to this undertaking can be financed out of cash provided by operating activities 
there can be no assurance that additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by us will not be required or that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such time as required
