item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that these concentrations are mitigated by the diversification of our loan portfolio among commercial  commercial and residential construction  commercial mortgage  home equity and consumer loans 
in addition  our business activities currently are mainly concentrated in fresno county  california 
consequently  our results of operations and financial condition are dependent upon the general trends in this part of the california economy and  in particular  the residential and commercial real estate markets 
in addition  our concentration of operations in this area of california exposes us to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes  such as earthquakes  fires and floods in this region or as a result of energy shortages in california 
our deposits are attracted from individual and commercial customers 
a material portion of our deposits have not been obtained from a single person or a few persons  the loss of any one or more of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in order to attract loan and deposit business from individuals and small businesses  we maintain the following lobby hours at our branches branch monday thursday friday saturday clovis main am to am am to am none clovis main drive up am to am am to am none foothill am to am am to am am to am herndon fowler am to am am to am am to am fig garden village am to am am to am am to am kerman am to am am to am none river park am to am am to am am to am river park drive up am to am am to am am to am sacramento private banking am to am am to am none oakhurst am to am am to am none madera am to am am to am none fresno downtown am to p

no automated teller machines are currently located at the sacramento office 
our real estate and small business administration sba departments maintain business hours of am to am  monday through friday  and extended hours are available at customer request 
to compete effectively  we rely substantially on local promotional activity  personal contacts by our officers  directors and employees  referrals by our shareholders  extended hours  personalized service and our reputation in the communities we serve 
in fresno and madera counties  in addition to our ten branch locations  serving the bank s primary service areas  as of december  there were operating banking offices in our primary service area  which consists of the cities of clovis  fresno  kerman  oakhurst  madera  and prather  california  of which were offices of regional and major chain banking systems and were offices of other community banks 
prather does not contain any banking offices other than our office 
additionally  our primary service area contains thrift offices 
and credit unions 
business activity in our primary service area is oriented towards light industry  small business and agriculture 
the june fdic summary of deposits report indicated the company had of the total deposits held by all depositories in fresno county and in madera county 
in sacramento county  in addition to our one branch  as of december  there were operating banking offices in our primary service area of which were offices of regional and major chain banking systems and were offices of other community banks 
the sacramento service area contains thrift offices 
the banking business in california generally  and our primary service area specifically  is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits  and is dominated by a relatively small number of major banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area 
among the advantages such major banks have over us is their ability to finance wide ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets  including loans  to regions of higher yield and demand 
major banks offer certain services such as international banking and trust services which are not offered directly but which usually can be offered indirectly through correspondent institutions 
in addition  by virtue of their greater total capitalization  such banks have substantially higher lending limits than we do 
legal lending limits to an individual customer are limited to a percentage of our total capital accounts 
as of december   the bank s legal loan limits to individual customers were  for unsecured loans and  for unsecured and secured loans combined 
for borrowers desiring loans in excess of the bank s lending limits  the bank makes and may  in the future  make such loans on a participation basis with other community banks taking the amount of loans in excess of the bank s lending limits 
in other cases  the bank may refer such borrowers to larger banks or other lending institutions 
other entities  both governmental and in private industry  seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities also provide competition for us in the acquisition of deposits 
banks also compete with money market funds and other money market instruments  which are not subject to interest rate ceilings 
in recent years  increased competition has also developed from specialized finance and non finance companies that offer wholesale finance  credit card  and other consumer finance services  including on line banking services and personal finance software 
competition for deposit and loan products remains strong  from both banking and non banking firms  and affects the rates of those products as well as the terms on which they are offered to customers 
technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets 
technological innovation has  for example  made it possible for non depository institutions to offer customers automated transfer payment services that previously have been traditional banking products 
in addition  customers now expect a choice of several delivery systems and channels  including telephone  mail  home computer  atms  self service branches  and in store branches 
mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to streamline their operations  reduce expenses  and increase revenues to remain competitive 
in addition  competition has intensified due to federal and state interstate banking laws  which permit banking organizations to expand geographically with fewer restrictions than in the past 
such laws allow banks to merge with other banks across state lines  thereby enabling banks to establish or expand banking operations in our market 
the competitive environment also is significantly impacted by federal and state legislation  which may make it easier for non bank financial institutions to compete with us

interest income from non accrual loans is recorded only if collection of principal in full is not in doubt and when and if received 
loans are placed on non accrual status and any accrued but unpaid interest income is reversed and charged against income when the payment of interest or principal is ninety days or more past due 
loans in the non accrual category are treated as non accrual loans even though we may ultimately recover all or a portion of the interest due 
these loans return to accrual status when the loan becomes contractually current and future collectibility of amounts due is reasonably assured 
there were  in loans on non accrual at december  see note of company s audited consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
at december  interest foregone on nonaccrual loans totaled  for the year then ended 
there were no loans on nonaccrual at december  or interest foregone on nonaccrual loans for the year then ended 
interest foregone on nonaccrual loans totaled  for the year ended december  in and  we had one restructured loan in the principal amount of  and  respectively 
at december   and the company had no restructured loans 
see note of the company s audited consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report concerning our recorded investment in loans for which an impairment has been recognized 
impaired loans are identified from internal credit review reports  past due reports  overdraft listings  and regulatory reports of examination 
borrowers experiencing problems such as operating losses  marginal working capital  inadequate cash flow or business interruptions which jeopardize collection of the loan are also reviewed for possible impairment classification 
when a loan is classified as impaired  the net fair value ie  the measure of the impaired loan is computed based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
alternatively  if the loan is collateral dependent  impairment is measured based on the fair value or market price of the collateral 
if the net fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  then the resulting impairment amount is recognized through the allowance for credit losses with a corresponding charge to the provision for credit losses 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due including both principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
as of december   we had no loans where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as impaired loans 
table g summary of loan loss experience the following table summarizes loan loss experience as of and for the years ended december      and dollars in thousands loans outstanding at december  average loans outstanding during period allowance for credit losses balance at beginning of year deduct loans charged off commercial and industrial real estate construction real estate other loans to finance agricultural and other loans to farmers loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures other total loans charged off add recoveries of loans charged off commercial and industrial real estate construction real estate other loans to finance agricultural and other loans to farmers loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures other total recoveries net charge offs recoveries allowance acquired in merger of bank of madera county add provision charged to operating expense balance at end of year allowance for credit losses as a percentage of outstanding loan balance net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding managing credits identified through the risk evaluation methodology includes developing a business strategy with the customer to mitigate our losses 
our management continues to monitor these credits with a view to identifying as early as possible when  and to what extent  additional provisions may be necessary 
the allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by the bank s and our board of directors audit compliance committee and by the bank s and our board of directors 
reserves are allocated to loan portfolio segments using percentages which are based on both historical risk elements such as delinquencies and losses and predictive risk elements such as economic  competitive and environmental factors 
we have adopted the specific reserve approach to allocate reserves to each adversely graded asset  as well as to each impaired asset for the purpose of estimating potential loss exposure 
although the allowance for credit losses is allocated to various portfolio categories  it is general in nature and available for the loan portfolio in its entirety 
additions may be required based on the results of independent loan portfolio examinations  regulatory agency examinations  or our own internal review process 
additions are also required when  in our management s judgment  the reserve does not properly reflect the potential loss exposure 
for  we added  to the allowance for credit losses 
the main reason for the provision was two commercial loans that were charged off in the fourth quarter 
the loans were to related borrowers whose business suffered a major event in the fourth quarter which affected their ability to continue their business 
we made no additions to the allowance for credit losses in  and due mainly to decreased levels of risk rated loans and increased recoveries on previously charged off loans 
the provision for credit losses was  in the provision primarily related to the an increase in non accrual loans  which totaled  at december  as well as a increase in loan volume during using the criteria on the previous page  the allocation of the allowance for credit losses is set forth below dollars in thousands amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans amount percent of loans in each category to total loans commercial and industrial real estate construction  land development and other land loans real estate other equity lines of credit loans to finance agricultural and other loans to farmers loans to individuals for household  family and other personal expenditures and other loans lease contracts other non specific reserve loans are charged to the allowance for credit losses when the loans are deemed uncollectible 
it is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance so that it remains adequate to cover all probable loan charge offs that exist in the portfolio at that time table h deposits we have no known foreign deposits

such regulation is intended  among other things  to protect depositors whose deposits are insured by the fdic and the banking system as a whole 
the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the board of governors  also influence the commercial banking business 
the board of governors implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial intermediaries subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the board of governors in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
indirectly such actions may also affect the ability of non bank financial institutions to compete with the bank 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
the laws  regulations  and policies affecting financial services businesses are continuously under review by congress and state legislatures  and federal and state regulatory agencies 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial intermediaries 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies and other financial intermediaries are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory and other professional agencies 
changes in the laws  regulations or policies that affect us cannot necessarily be predicted  but they may have a material effect on our business and earnings 
bank holding company regulation the company  as a bank holding company  is subject to regulation under the bhc act  and is subject to the supervision and examination of the board of governors 
pursuant to the bhc act  we are required to obtain the prior approval of the board of governors before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of voting shares of any bank if  after giving effect to such acquisition  we would own or control  directly or indirectly  more than percent of such bank 
under the bhc act  we may not engage in any business other than managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiaries that the board of governors deems to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking 
we are also prohibited  with certain exceptions  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than percent of the voting shares of any company unless the company is engaged in banking activities or the board of governors determines that the activity is so closely related to banking to be a proper incident to banking 
the board of governors approval must be obtained before the shares of any such company can be acquired and  in certain cases  before any approved company can open new offices 
the bhc act and regulations of the board of governors also impose certain constraints on the redemption or purchase by a bank holding company of its own shares of stock 
our earnings and activities are affected by legislation  by actions of regulators  and by local legislative and administrative bodies and decisions of courts in the jurisdictions in which both the company and the bank conduct business 
for example  these include limitations on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company and the ability of the company to pay dividends to its shareholders 
it is the policy of the board of governors that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries 
various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval 
in addition to these explicit limitations  the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a banking subsidiary or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
depending upon the circumstances  the agencies could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
in addition  banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law in dealings with their holding companies and other affiliates 
subject to certain exceptions set forth in the federal reserve act and the recently enacted regulation w  a bank can make a loan or extend credit to an affiliate  purchase or invest in the securities of an affiliate  purchase assets from an affiliate  accept securities of an affiliate as collateral security for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company  issue a guarantee  or accept letters of credit on behalf of an affiliate only if the aggregate amount of the above transactions of such subsidiary does not exceed percent of such subsidiary s capital stock and surplus on a per affiliate basis or percent of such subsidiary s capital stock and surplus on an aggregate affiliate basis 
such transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase a low quality asset  as that term is defined in the federal reserve act  from an affiliate 
such restrictions also generally prevent a holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the holding company unless the loans are secured by collateral 
a holding company and its banking subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or provision of services 
for example  with certain exceptions a bank may not condition an extension of credit on a customer obtaining other services provided by it  a holding company or any of its other bank affiliates  or on a promise by the customer not to obtain other services from a competitor 
the board of governors has cease and desist powers over parent bank holding companies and non banking subsidiaries where actions of a parent bank holding company or its non financial institution subsidiaries represent an unsafe or unsound practice or violation of law 
the board of governors has the authority to regulate debt obligations other than commercial paper issued by bank holding companies by imposing interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt obligations 
we are also a bank holding company within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
as such  we and our subsidiaries are subject to examination by the department of financial institutions dfi 
further  we are required by the board of governors to maintain certain capital levels 
see capital standards 
regulation of the bank banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
the bank  as a california state chartered bank  is subject to primary supervision  regulation and periodic examination by the dfi and the fdic 
the bank is not a member of the federal reserve system  but is nevertheless subject to certain regulations of the board of governors 
if  as a result of an examination of a bank  the fdic should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation  various remedies are available to the fdic 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict the growth of the bank  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  and ultimately to terminate the bank s deposit insurance  which for a california chartered bank would result in a revocation of the bank s charter 
the dfi has many of the same remedial powers 
the bank is a member of the fdic  which currently insures customer deposits in each member bank to a maximum of  per depositor 
for this protection  the bank is subject to the rules and regulations of the fdic  and  as is the case with all insured banks  may be required to pay a semi annual statutory assessment 
various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the state of california and the united states affect the operations of the bank 
state and federal statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including standards for safety and soundness  reserves against deposits  interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  mergers and acquisitions  borrowings  dividends  locations of branch offices  fair lending requirements  community reinvestment act activities  and loans to affiliates 
payment of dividends the company our shareholders are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by our board of directors  out of funds legally available  subject to the dividends preference  if any  on preferred shares that may be outstanding  and also subject to the restrictions of the california corporations code 
at december   we had no outstanding shares of preferred stock 
the principal source of cash revenue to the company is dividends received from the bank 
the bank s ability to make dividend payments to the company is subject to state and federal regulatory restrictions 
the bank dividends payable by the bank to the company are restricted under california law to the lesser of the bank s retained earnings  or the bank s net income for the latest three fiscal years  less dividends paid during that period  or  with the approval of the dfi  to the greater of the retained earnings of the bank  the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year or the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
in addition to the regulations concerning minimum uniform capital adequacy requirements described below  the fdic has established guidelines regarding the maintenance of an adequate allowance for credit losses 
therefore  the future payment of cash dividends by the bank will generally depend  in addition to regulatory constraints  upon the bank s earnings during any fiscal period  the assessment of the board of directors of the capital requirements of the bank and other factors  including the maintenance of an adequate allowance for credit losses 
capital standards the board of governors  the fdic and other federal banking agencies have issued risk based capital adequacy guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital adequacy that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are reported as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us government securities  to for assets with relatively higher credit risk  such as business loans 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items 
the regulators measure risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items against both total qualifying capital the sum of tier capital and limited amounts of tier capital and tier capital 
tier capital consists of common stock  retained earnings  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in certain subsidiaries  less most other intangible assets 
tier capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity 
the inclusion of elements of tier capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies 
since december   the federal banking agencies have required a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of  and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets and off balance sheet items of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to average total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
it is improbable  however  that an institution with a leverage ratio would receive the highest rating by the regulators since a strong capital position is a significant part of the regulators rating 
for all banking organizations not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio is at least to basis points above the minimum 
thus  the effective minimum leverage ratio  for all practical purposes  is at least or 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
a bank that does not achieve and maintain the required capital levels may be issued a capital directive by the fdic to ensure the maintenance of required capital levels 
as discussed above  the company and the bank are required to maintain certain levels of capital 
the regulatory capital guidelines as well as the actual capitalization for the bank and the company on a consolidated basis as of december  follow requirement actual adequately capitalized for the bank to be well capitalized bank company total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage capital ratio usa patriot act in the wake of the tragic events of september th  on october   the president signed the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism usa patriot act of the usa patriot act also made significant changes to the bank secrecy act 
under the usa patriot act  financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and of identifying customers when establishing new relationships and standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers 
for example  the enhanced due diligence policies  procedures  and controls generally require financial institutions to take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transaction  to ascertain the identity of the nominal and beneficial owners of  and the source of funds deposited into  each account as needed to guard against money laundering and report any suspicious transactions  to ascertain for any foreign bank  the shares of which are not publicly traded  the identity of the owners of the foreign bank  and the nature and extent of the ownership interest of each such owner  and to ascertain whether any foreign bank provides correspondent accounts to other foreign banks and  if so  the identity of those foreign banks and related due diligence information 
under the usa patriot act  financial institutions are to establish anti money laundering programs to enhance their bank secrecy act program 
the usa patriot act sets forth minimum standards for these programs  including the development of internal policies  procedures  and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test the programs 
bank management believes that the bank is currently in compliance with the act 
financial services modernization legislation on november   president clinton signed into law the gramm leach bliley act  also known as the financial services modernization act 
this legislation eliminated many of the barriers that have separated the insurance  securities and banking industries since the great depression 
the federal banking agencies the board of governors  fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency among others  continue to draft regulations to implement the gramm leach bliley act 
the gramm leach bliley act is the result of a decade of debate in the congress regarding a fundamental reformation of the nation s financial system 
the law is subdivided into seven titles  by functional area 
the major provisions of the gramm leach bliley act are financial holding companies and financial activities 
title i establishes a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms  and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the bhc act framework to permit a holding company system to engage in a full range of financial activities through qualification as a new entity known as a financial holding company 
final regulations adopted by the fdic in january  in the form of amendments to part of the fdic rules and regulations  provide the framework for subsidiaries of state nonmember banks to engage in financial activities that the gramm leach bliley act permits national banks to conduct through a financial subsidiary 
activities permissible for financial subsidiaries of national banks  and  pursuant to section of the fdic rules and regulations  also permissible for financial subsidiaries of state nonmember banks  include  but are not limited to  the following a lending  exchanging  transferring  investing for others  or safeguarding money or securities  b insuring  guaranteeing  or indemnifying against loss  harm  damage  illness  disability  or death  or providing and issuing annuities  and acting as principal  agent  or broker for purposes of the foregoing  in any state  c providing financial  investment  or economic advisory services  including advising an investment company  d issuing or selling instruments representing interests in pools of assets permissible for a bank to hold directly  and e underwriting  dealing in  or making a market in securities 
securities activities 
title ii narrows the exemptions from the securities laws previously enjoyed by banks and creates a new  voluntary investment bank holding company 
the board of governors and the sec continue to work together to draft rules governing certain securities activities of banks 
insurance activities 
title iii restates the proposition that the states are the functional regulators for all insurance activities  including the insurance activities of federally chartered banks  and bars the states from prohibiting insurance activities by depository institutions 
privacy 
under title v  federal banking regulators were required to adopt rules that have limited the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party 
federal banking regulators issued final rules on may  to implement the privacy provisions of title v 
under the rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
compliance with these rules was mandatory after july  the company and the bank were in full compliance with the rules as of or prior to their respective effective dates 
safeguarding confidential customer information 
under title v  federal banking regulators are required to adopt rules requiring financial institutions to implement a program to protect confidential customer information 
in january  the federal banking agencies adopted guidelines requiring financial institutions to establish an information security program 
the bank implemented a security program appropriate to its size and complexity and the nature and scope of its operations prior to the july  effective date of the regulatory guidelines  and since initial implementation has  as necessary  updated and improved that program 
community reinvestment act sunshine requirements 
the federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations implementing section of title vii of the gramm leach bliley act  the sunshine requirements 
the regulations require nongovernmental entities or persons and insured depository institutions and affiliates that are parties to written agreements made in connection with the fulfillment of the institution s cra obligations to make available to the public and the federal banking agencies a copy of each agreement 
neither the company nor the bank is a party to any agreement that would be the subject of reporting pursuant to the cra sunshine requirements 
the company continues to evaluate the strategic opportunities presented by the broad powers granted to bank holding companies that elect to be treated as financial holding companies 
in the event that the company determines that access to the broader powers of a financial holding company is in the best interests of the company  its shareholders and the bank  the company will file the appropriate election with the board of governors 
the company and the bank intend to comply with all provisions of the gramm leach bliley act and all implementing regulations as they become effective 
consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature  and insured institutions have been advised to monitor carefully compliance with such laws and regulations 
the bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations  some of which are discussed below 
the community reinvestment act cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess a bank s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
the agencies use the cra assessment factors in order to provide a rating to the financial institution 
the ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
the bank was last examined for cra compliance by its primary regulator  the fdic  as of march the equal credit opportunity act ecoa generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
the truth in lending act tila is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology to express rates and payments  including the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total of payments and the payment schedule  among other things 
the fair housing act fh act regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing related lending activities against any person because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
a number of lending practices have been found by the courts to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
the home mortgage disclosure act hmda grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods and provides public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
the hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
finally  the real estate settlement procedures act respa requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
penalties under the above laws may include fines  reimbursements and other penalties 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with the cra  tila  fh act  ecoa  hmda and respa generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in its local community 
california financial information privacy act fair credit reporting act in  the federal fair credit reporting act the fcra was enacted to insure the confidentiality  accuracy  relevancy and proper utilization of consumer credit report information 
under the framework of the fcra  the united states has developed a highly advanced and efficient credit reporting system 
the information contained in that broad system is used by financial institutions  retailers and other creditors of every size in making a wide variety of decisions regarding financial transactions 
employers and law enforcement agencies have also made wide use of the information collected and maintained in databases made possible by the fcra 
the fcra affirmatively preempts state law in a number of areas  including the ability of entities affiliated by common ownership to share and exchange information freely  and the requirements on credit bureaus to reinvestigate the contents of reports in response to consumer complaints  among others 
the california financial information privacy act  which was enacted in  requires a financial institution to provide specific information to a consumer related to the sharing of that consumer s nonpublic personal information 
the act allows a consumer to direct the financial institution not to share his or her nonpublic personal information with affiliated or nonaffiliated companies with which a financial institution has contracted to provide financial products and services  and requires that permission from each such consumer be acquired by a financial institution prior to sharing such information 
the fact act  fair and accurate credit transaction act became law in  effectively extending and amending provisions of the fair credit reporting act fcra 
the fact act created many new responsibilities for consumer reporting agencies and users of consumer reports 
it contains many new consumer disclosre requirements as well as provisions to address identity theft 

check act on december   the board of governors amended regulation cc and its commentary to implement the check clearing for the st century act check act

other other legislation which has been or may be proposed to the united states congress and the california legislature and regulations which may be proposed by the board of governors  fdic and the dfi may affect our business 
it cannot be predicted whether any pending or proposed legislation or regulations will be adopted or the effect such legislation or regulations may have upon our business 
item a risk factors risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect our future results our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the central valley and california 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the market areas in which we operate 
the local economic conditions of these areas have a significant impact on our commercial  real estate and construction loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  such as inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  an outbreak of hostilities  unemployment and other factors beyond our control will impact these local economic conditions and will negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations 
in addition  the central valley remains largely dependent on agriculture 
a downturn in agriculture and agricultural related business could indirectly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on the small to medium sized business market 
our business development and marketing strategy primarily targets the banking and financial needs of small to medium sized businesses with non complex credit needs 
these businesses are diverse and not dependent upon one industry and represent a major sector of the central valley economies 
if general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the central valley in which we operate  our results of operations and financial condition will be significantly affected 
if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
our loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans  and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment 
we may experience significant credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the size of the allowance  we rely on our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio 
significant additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those we make 
any increase in our allowance or charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative affect on us 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability 
we realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
in either event  if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us  and our earnings may be negatively affected 
we are unable to predict fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by the following factors inflation  recession  a rise in unemployment  tightening money supply  international disorder  and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
our asset liability management strategy  which is designed to address the risk from changes in market interest rates and the shape of the yield curve  may not prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability 
we face vigorous competition from banks and other financial institutions  including savings institutions  finance companies and credit unions 
a number of these banks and other financial institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits  larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services 
to a limited extent  we also compete with other providers of financial services  such as money market mutual funds  brokerage firms  consumer finance companies and insurance companies 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking services  reduce our market share and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we face competition primarily from other banks in attracting  developing and retaining qualified banking professionals 
we may not be able to maintain our historical growth rate which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we have initiated internal growth programs  completed various acquisitions and opened additional offices in the past few years 
we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow at all 
we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable candidates for acquisition 
various factors  such as economic conditions and competition  may impede or prohibit the opening of new branch offices 
further  our inability to attract and retain experienced bankers may adversely affect our internal growth 
a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to complete acquisitions  and once complete  may not be able to integrate our acquisitions successfully 
our growth strategy includes our desire to acquire other financial institutions 
we may not be able to complete any future acquisitions and  if completed  we may not be able to successfully integrate the operations  management  products and services of the entities we acquire 
we may not realize expected cost savings or make revenue enhancements 
following each acquisition  we must expend substantial managerial  operating  financial and other resources to integrate these entities 
in particular  we may be required to install and standardize adequate operational and control systems  deploy or modify equipment  implement marketing efforts in new as well as existing locations and employ and maintain qualified personnel 
our failure to successfully integrate the entities we acquire into our existing operations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and local laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities 
any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on us and our operations 
additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers  authority and operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
further  regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties 
the exercise of this regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on us

economic conditions fresno county s economy has been relatively stable for the past three to four years  however  some minor evidence of a slow down has been evident in the fourth quarter of most industries in the county are either stable or contracting very modestly 
fresno county s double digit unemployment is one of the highest rates in california and the nation  however in the fourth quarter of  the county reported single digit unemployment for the first time in many years 
this high level is a hindrance to strong growth in the county 
agriculture and agricultural related businesses remain a critical part of the county s economy 
the county s agricultural production is widely diversified producing cotton  nuts  vegetables  fruit  cattle  and dairy products 
due to low land costs  relative to the rest of the state  fresno s economy has been significantly affected by the real estate construction segment in the past years 
several new and planned developments in the foothill area of the county may assist the industry in maintaining its growth 
however  there are indications of a slowing in the housing market  residential permits have been declining in fresno county also offers lower living costs compared with metropolitan areas to the north and south of the county 
fresno county s home appreciation has averaged annually over the past four years 
while affordability has declined as a result  the area is still considered more affordable than other places in california 
residential construction  while slowing somewhat  still appears to be strong 
the local economy benefited from growth in housing and construction fueled by record low long term interest rates  demand for new housing and refinance activity stock split on september  the company s board of directors approved a two for one stock split for shareholders of record at the close of business on october  and effective on october  all share and per share data in the consolidated financial statements and the following management s discussion and analysis have been retroactively restated to give effect to the stock split

we had no other real estate owned at december  and key factors in evaluating financial condition and operating performance as a publicly traded community bank holding company  we focus on several key factors including return to our stockholders  return on average assets  development of core revenue streams  including net interest income and non interest income  asset quality  asset growth  and operating efficiency 
return to our stockholders 
our return to our stockholders is measured in the form of return on average equity roe 
our net income for december  increased  compared to increases of  and  for and  respectively 
net income increased mainly due to an increase in net interest income provided by the increase in interest rates and the additional loan volume from the bmc merger and our own organic growth 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in interest expenses  addition to the provision for credit losses  operating expenses and a decrease in non interest income 
basic eps increased to for the year ended compared to and for years ended and  respectively 
diluted eps increased to for the year ended compared to and for years ended and  respectively 
the increase in eps was due primarily to the increase in net income  partially offset by the increase in average shares outstanding as a result of the merger and the exercise of stock options 
our roe was for the year ended compared to and for the years ended and  respectively 
the increase in roe is due to the increase in income partially offset by the increase in average equity outstanding  as a result of the bmc merger 
return on average assets our return on average assets roa is a measure we use to compare our performance with other banks and bank holding companies 
our roa for the year ended increased to compared to and for the years ended december  and the increase in roa is due to the increase in net income relative to our increase in average assets 
roa for our peer group was at september  peer group from snl financial data includes all holding companies in california with assets from m to m and not subchapter s 
development of core earnings over the past several years  we have focused on not only improving net income  but improving the consistency of our revenue streams in order to create more predictable future earnings and reduce the effect of changes in our operating environment on our net income 
specifically  we have focused on net interest income through a variety of processes  including increases in average interest earning assets as a result of the merger  loan generation and retention and improved net interest margin by focusing on core deposit growth and managing the cost of funds 
as a result  our net interest income before provision for credit losses increased  or to  for the year ended compared to  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
our net interest margin has also improved basis points to for the year ended compared to and for the years ended and  respectively

the company exited that activity in customer service charges increased slightly to  in compared to  and  in and  respectively  mainly due to an increase in the number of transaction accounts 
further detail on non interest income is provided below 
asset quality for all banks and bank holding companies  asset quality has a significant impact on the overall financial condition and results of operations 
asset quality is measured in terms of percentage of total loans and total assets  and is a key element in estimating the future earnings of a company 
non performing loans totaled  as of december  compared to none as of december  and  as of december  two loans comprised the  in non performing loans  and as of december   both loans were on nonaccrual 
management maintains certain loans that have been brought current by the borrower less than days delinquent on non accrual status until such time as management has determined that the loans are likely to remain current in future periods 
in december  we charged off two commercial loans in which the company had suffered a fire in one of their facilities 
the event had a material impact on the operations of the company  which has subsequently filed for chapter protection 
recovery potential on these two loans is uncertain 
as a result of the charge off  we also increased our provision for credit losses to  for compared to no provision in and non performing loans as a percentage of gross loans were as of december  compared to none at december  and at december  the company did not have any other real estate owned at december   or asset growth as revenues from both net interest income and non interest income are a function of asset size  the continued growth in assets has a direct impact in increasing net income and therefore roe and roa 
the majority of our assets are loans and investment securities  and the majority of our liabilities are deposits  and therefore the ability to generate deposits as a funding source for loans and investments is fundamental to our asset growth 
total assets increased during to  as of december  from  as of december  total gross loans increased to  as of december   compared to  at december  total investment securities increased to  as of december  compared to  as of december  as deposit growth exceeded loan growth 
total deposits increased to  as of december  compared to  as of december  we continue to under perform in our loan to deposit ratio compared to our peers 
our loan to deposit ratio at december  was compared to at december  the loan to deposit ratio of our peers was at september  operating efficiency operating efficiency is the measure of how efficiently earnings before taxes are generated as a percentage of revenue 
the bank s efficiency ratio non interest expenses divided by net interest income plus non interest income  excluding realized gain on sale of securities improved to for compared to for and at the improvement in the efficiency ratio is due to the increase in revenues exceeding the increase in operating expenses 
the bank s net interest income before provision for credit losses plus non interest income increased to  in compared to  in and  in  while operating expenses increased in and in and in the increase in operating expenses in can be partially attributed to the merger

basic earnings per share were  and for  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were  and for  and  respectively 
roe was for compared to for  and for roa for was compared to and for and  respectively 
the increase in net income and profitability for compared to the same period in was mainly due to the increases in net interest income and was partially offset by decreases in non interest income and increases in the provision for credit losses and non interest expenses 
net interest income increased due to an increase in average interest earning assets provided by our organic growth  the merger  and the positive effect of our asset sensitive position expanding our net interest margin in response to the thirteen increases in the federal funds interest rate since june  non interest income in included a realized gain from the sale of investments of  compared to the gain from the sale of investments of  in and  in non interest expenses increased primarily due to salaries and benefits and equipment and occupancy expenses that were all affected by the bmc merger 
interest income and expense net interest income is the most significant component of our income from operations 
net interest income the interest rate spread is the difference between the gross interest and fees earned on the loan and investment portfolios and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowings 
net interest income depends on the volume of and interest rate earned on interest earning assets and the volume of and interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities

interest and fee income from loans increased in compared to the same period of interest and fee income increased from to as stated above  the combination of the increased volume of loans from the merger with bmc  our organic growth from the focus on building relationships  and the thirteen interest rate increases that have occurred since june   were the major components of the  increase

in an effort to increase yields  without accepting unreasonable risk  a significant portion of the investment purchases have been in high quality mortgage backed securities mbs and collateralized mortgage obligations cmos 
at december   we held  or of the total market value of the investment portfolio in mbs and cmos with an average yield of 
we understand the interest rate risks and prepayment risks associated with mbs and cmos 
in a declining interest rate environment  prepayments from mbs and cmos could be expected to increase and the expected life of the investment could be expected to shorten 
conversely  if interest rates increase  prepayments could be expected to decline and the average life of the mbs and cmos could be expected to extend 
additionally  changes in interest rates are reflected in the market value of the investment portfolio 
during declining interest rates  the investment portfolio could be expected to have market value gains and in increasing rate environments  the market value could be expected to decline 
the net of tax effect of the change in market value of the available for sale investment portfolio is also reflected in the company s equity 
at december   the average life of the investment portfolio was years and the market value reflected a pre tax loss of  a component of the company s strategic plan has been to use its investment portfolio to offset  in part  its interest rate risk relating to variable rate loans 
at december   an immediate rate increase of basis points would result in an estimated decrease in the market value of the investment portfolio by approximately  conversely  with an immediate rate decrease of basis points  the estimated increase in the market value of the investment portfolio is  the modeling environment assumes management would take no action during an immediate shock of basis points 
the likelihood of immediate changes of basis points is contrary to expectation  as evidenced by the changes in interest rates in the past year  which were in basis point increments 
however  the company uses those increments to measure its interest rate risk in accordance with regulatory requirements and to measure the possible future risk in the investment portfolio

provision for credit losses we provide for possible credit losses by a charge to operating income based upon the composition of the loan portfolio  past delinquency levels  losses and non performing assets  economic and environmental conditions and other factors which  in management s judgement  deserve recognition in estimating credit losses 
loans are charged off when they are considered uncollectible or of such little value that continuance as an active earning bank asset is not warranted 
the establishment of an adequate credit allowance is based on both an accurate risk rating system and loan portfolio management tools 
the board has established initial responsibility for the accuracy of credit risk grades with the individual credit officer 
the grading is then submitted to the chief credit administrator cca  who reviews the grades for accuracy and makes recommendations to credit review who gives final approval 
the risk grading and reserve allocation is analyzed annually by a third party credit reviewer and by various regulatory agencies 
quarterly  the cca sets the specific reserve for all adversely risk graded credits 
this process includes the utilization of loan delinquency reports  classified asset reports  and portfolio concentration reports to assist in accurately assessing credit risk and establishing appropriate reserves 
reserves are also allocated to credits that are not adversely graded 
historical loss experience within the portfolio along with peer bank loss experiences are used in determining the level of the reserves held 
the allowance for credit losses is reviewed at least quarterly by the board s audit compliance committee and by the board of directors 
reserves are allocated to loan portfolio categories using percentages which are based on both historical risk elements such as delinquencies and losses and predictive risk elements such as economic  competitive and environmental factors 
we have adopted the specific reserve approach to allocate reserves to each adversely graded asset  as well as to each impaired asset for the purpose of estimating potential loss exposure 
although the allowance for credit losses is allocated to various portfolio categories  it is general in nature and available for the loan portfolio in its entirety 
additions may be required based on the results of independent loan portfolio examinations  regulatory agency examinations  or our own internal review process 
additions are also required when  in management s judgement  the allowance does not properly reflect the portfolio s potential loss exposure

management continues to monitor these credits with a view to identifying as early as possible when  and to what extent  additional provisions may be necessary 
the provision for credit losses in was  there were no provisions made in and the increase in is primarily the result of our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses after giving effect to the charge off in december of two commercial loans 
the borrower suffered a fire in one of their facilities 
the event had a material impact on the operations of the company which has subsequently filed for chapter protection 
recovery potential on these two loans is uncertain 
non performing loans as a percentage of gross loans was as of december  compared to none at december  and at december  non performing loans as of december  totaled  and were comprised of one real estate secured loan for  and one commercial loan for  we do not anticipate a loss on either loan 
the company did not have any other real estate owned at december  or for we had a net charge off ratio of 
for  we had a net recovery ratio of  and a net charge off ratio of for the potential for a future net recovery position is not likely as we have been very successful in collection of those loans charged off in prior years 
refer to the allowance for credit losses section for further discussion of credit quality 
the completion of the merger of bmc into the bank provided an additional  to the allowance for credit losses 
based on information currently available  management believes that the allowance for credit losses should be adequate to absorb estimated probable losses in the portfolio 
however  no assurance can be given that we may not sustain charge offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period

non interest income non interest income is comprised of customer service charges  loan placement fees  gain on sales of investments and other income 
non interest income was  in compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the  decrease in non interest income comparing to was primarily due to the decrease in gain realized on sale of investment securities of  the decrease from to was mainly due to the  decrease in rentals from equipment leased to others 
we have allowed the volume of leases to run off and have not replaced them as we have exited that activity 
customer service charges increased  to  in compared to  in and  in the increase in both years is mainly due to an increase in the activity level as the average number of transaction accounts has increased and the increase in fees generated by the overdraft protection program which began in we earn loan placement fees from the brokerage of single family residential mortgage loans provided for the convenience of our customers 
loan placement fees increased  in to  compared to  for and decreased in by  from  in the increase in is primarily due to the continued relative strength of normal home sales due to moving up or relocating as fresno and madera counties continue to reflect affordable housing compared to other parts of california 
the decrease in compared to is mainly due to the impact of the increases in mortgage rates and less refinancing opportunities 
appreciation in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli increased  mainly due to  in boli purchased in the bank purchased the additional insurance in connection with increases to the split dollar life insurance policies related to salary continuation benefits for four key executives 
offsetting the increase in volume was a decrease in the interest rate received 
appreciation in compared to decreased  as a result of the decrease in the yields earned 
this interest rate is reviewed annually by the board of directors 
salary continuation and the related boli are used as a retention tool for directors and key executives of the bank

investments our investment portfolio consists primarily of agency securities  mortgage backed securities  municipal securities  and overnight investments in the federal funds market and are all classified as available for sale 
as of december   investment securities with a fair value of  were held as collateral for public funds  treasury  tax  and for other purposes 
our investment policies are established by the board of directors and implemented by our investment asset liability committee 
it is designed primarily to provide and maintain liquidity  to enable us to meet our pledging requirements for public money and borrowing arrangements  to generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk  and to complement our lending activities 
the volume of our investment portfolio is generally considered higher than our peers due mostly to our relatively low loan to deposit ratio 
the total investment portfolio increased from  at december  to  at december  the market value of the portfolio reflected an unrealized loss of  at december  compared to an unrealized gain of  at december  which reflects the increase in the federal funds rate of basis points since the end of the year 
management periodically evaluates each investment security for other than temporary impairment  relying primarily on industry analyst reports  observation of market conditions and interest rate fluctuations 
management believes it will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the underlying investment securities and that the noted decline in fair value is considered temporary and due only to interest rate fluctuations 
see note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for carrying values and estimated fair values of our investment securities portfolio

this level of concentration is consistent with december  although management believes the loans within this concentration have no more than the normal risk of collectibility  a substantial decline in the performance of the economy in general or a decline in real estate values in the our primary market areas  in particular  could have an adverse impact on collectibility  increase the level of real estate related non performing loans  or have other adverse effects which alone or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that our commercial real estate loan underwriting policies and practices result in prudent extensions of credit  but recognize that our lending activities result in relatively high reported commercial real estate lending levels 
commercial real estate loans include certain loans which represent low to moderate risk and certain loans with higher risks 
the board of directors reviews and approves concentration limits and exceptions to limitations of concentration are reported to the board of directors at least quarterly 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non performing loans  other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets 
non performing loans are those loans which have i been placed on non accrual status  ii been subject to troubled debt restructuring  iii been classified as doubtful under our asset classification system  or iv become contractually past due days or more with respect to principal or interest and have not been restructured or otherwise placed on non accrual status 
a loan is classified as non accrual when it is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  payment in full of principal or interest under the original contractual terms is not expected  or principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection 
at december  and december   we had no oreo  repossessed assets or restructured loans 
at december   we had two non accrual loans totaling  compared to no non accrual loans at december  at december   we estimated the potential for any losses from these credits would have a minimal impact on the allowance for credit losses 
a summary of non accrual  restructured  and past due loans at december  and december  is set forth below 
the company had no restructured loans and no accruing loans past due more than days at december  and december  management is not aware of any potential problem loans  which were current and accruing at december   where serious doubt exists as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present repayment terms

as of december   we had  in impaired loans 
we place loans on non accrual status that are delinquent days or more or when a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of interest and principal 
management maintains certain loans that have been brought current by the borrower less than days delinquent on non accrual status until such time as management has determined that the loans are likely to remain current in future periods 
classified assets from time to time  management has reason to believe that certain borrowers may not be able to repay their loans within the parameters of the present repayment terms  even though  in some cases  the loans are current at the time 
these loans are graded in the classified loan grades of substandard  doubtful  or loss and include non performing loans 
each classified loan is monitored monthly 
classified assets  consisting of non accrual loans  loans graded as substandard or lower  other real estate owned and repossessed assets  all net of government guarantees  totaled  as of december  compared to  as of december  allowance for credit losses we have established a methodology for the determination of the allowance for credit losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and takes into consideration the need for an overall allowance for credit losses as well as specific allowances that are tied to individual loans 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance and a specific allowance for identified problem loans 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  general economic conditions and  in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral securing the loan 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged against earnings and reduced by net loan charge offs 
loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectible  or partially charged off when portions of a loan are deemed to be uncollectible 
recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the responsibility for the review of our assets and the determination of the adequacy lies with management and our audit committee 
they delegate the authority to the cca to determine the loss reserve ratio for each type of asset and reviews  at least quarterly  the adequacy of the allowance based on an evaluation of the portfolio  past experience  prevailing market conditions  amount of government guarantees  concentration in loan types and other relevant factors 
the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is based on two principles of accounting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the company under sfas no 
establishes reserves 
credit administration adheres to an internal asset review system and loss allowance methodology designed to provide for timely recognition of problem assets and adequate valuation allowances to cover expected asset losses 
the bank s asset monitoring process includes the use of asset classifications to segregate the assets  largely loans and real estate  into various risk categories 
the bank uses the various asset classifications as a means of measuring risk and determining the adequacy of valuation allowances by using a nine grade system to classify assets 
all credit facilities exceeding days of delinquency require classification 
the allowance for credit losses has seven components the general valuation allowance  criticized and classified allowance  the specific valuation allowance  large borrower risk allowance  pool loan allowance  q factor allowance and the model risk allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
general valuation allowances gva this element relates to assets with no well defined deficiency or weakness ie assets classified pass and takes into consideration losses that are imbedded within the portfolio but have not yet been recognized 
generally  borrowers are impacted by events well in advance of a lender s knowledge that may ultimately result in loan default and eventual loss 
an example of such a loss causing event would be the loss of a major tenant in the case of commercial real estate loan 
general valuation allowances are determined through consideration of past loss experience gva is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans  in each case based on the internal risk grade of pass of such loans and commercial leases 
changes in risk grades affect the amount of the allowance 
loss factors are based on our historical loss experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
loss factors are developed in the following ways pass graded loss factors for commercial  financial  and industrial loans along with real estate construction 
participated  commercial or consumer 
derive from a migration model that tracks historical losses over a period usually the last thirty six calendar months which we believe captures the inherent losses in our loan portfolio  pass graded loss factors for commercial real estate loans are based on the average annual net charge off rate over a period reflective of a full economic cycle  the past seven years 
we believe that an economic cycle is a period in which both upturns and downturns in the economy have been reflected 
we calculate a loss factor over a time interval that spans what we believe constitutes a complete and representative economic cycle 
criticized and classified allowance at the time of credit analysis and risk determination  credits  which have been determined to contain a weakness higher than management s overall risk appetite  are graded as criticized or classified 
once validated that the credit is not impaired  a risk of loss is calculated and applied 
the cca identifies credits that have a risk level of special mention or worse  however not inclusive of impaired assets 
the calculation uses the credit s expected default frequency edf as estimated by moody s risk for private companies 
in each case use of the loan maturity defines if the one or five year default component is employed 
default is defined by moody s as a statistical probability that the credit will either miss or delay interest and or principal payment  bankruptcy or receivership will occur  or exchange security where the exchange has the apparent purpose of helping the borrower avoid default 
the exception to use of the edf is found in the watch credits whereby the loan has an automatic reserve held on outstanding balance 
if the edf has not been calculated  the bank maintains an allocation equal to the sum of of those loans classified loss of those loans classified doubtful of those loans classified substandard of those loans classified special mention of those loans classified watch pool loan allowance pla our residential and consumer loans and leases are relatively homogeneous with no single loan individually significant in terms of its size or potential risk of loss 
therefore  we review our residential and consumer portfolios by analyzing their performance as a pool of loans 
generally  borrowers become impacted by events well in advance of a lender s knowledge that may ultimately result in loan default and eventual loss 
examples of such loss causing events would be borrower job loss  divorce or medical crisis in the case of single family residential and consumer loans 
risk grade is not a component of this computation 
loss factors are developed in the following ways pooled loan loss factors not individually graded loans are based on expected net charge offs for one year 
pooled loans are loans that are homogeneous in nature  such as consumer installment  home equity  residential mortgage loans and consumer leases 
large borrower risk allowance lba cvcb has a number of borrowers with large loan balances which may create an additional risk if one or two of these borrowers were to unexpectedly default 
therefore an additional allowance for this risk is analyzed and applied 
lba identifies those credits with outstandings exceeding the house lending limit 
q factor allowances qfa the methodology applied in all other allowance sections does not account for both quantitative and qualitative factors and documentation 
any methodology falls subject to some uncertainties 
all loans and commercial leases contain  in management s judgment  factors where loss recognition exists due to effects of the national and local economies  trends in nature and volume  changes in mix  consumer credit score migration  loan administration  concentrations  changes in internal lending policies  and collection practices to mention just a few 
qfa is subjective by definition 
the factors reflect management s overall estimate of the additional rate of loss over the next four quarters that differ from either the historical loss experience or other valuations 
the factors ever evolve and expectation of change from quarter to quarter is expected  both in inclusion and in value 
as multiple factors exist which may be evaluated in connection with this allowance  topics noted below are examples only general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current economic cycle  government regulation bank regulatory examination results  and findings of our internal and external credit reviewers 
model risk allowance mra the allowance methodologies noted above are by definition imprecise 
any methodology is subject to some uncertainties 
estimating future losses inherent in a loan portfolio will vary with each method 
therefore  one applies a model risk component to determine a loss provision 
this allowance is also used to establish a minimum floor by which the provision for credit loss would not decline below of total gross loans 
the following table sets forth information regarding our allowance for credit losses at the dates and for the periods indicated for the years ended december  dollars in thousands balance  beginning of the year addition from merger with bmc provision charged to operations losses charged to the allowance recoveries on loans previously charged off balance  end of period ratio of non performing loans to allowance for credit losses n a allowance for credit losses to total loans as of december  the balance in the allowance for credit losses was  compared to  as of december  the increase resulted from the incorporation of the allowance for credit losses from the merger with bmc into the bank s allowance and the  additional provision  offset by net charge offs totaling  the balance of commitments to extend credit on undisbursed construction and other loans and letters of credit was  as of december  compared to  as of december  risks and uncertainties exist in all lending transactions  and even though there have historically been no charge offs on construction and other loans that have not been fully disbursed  our management and directors loan committee have established reserve levels based on historical losses as well as economic uncertainties and other risks that exist as of each reporting period 
as of december  the allowance was of total gross loans compared to as of december  some shift occurred in the concentration of real estate loans without an offsetting increase in the allocated allowance 
however  based on the company s historical low rate of real estate charge offs  management feels the current allocation is adequate 
assumptions regarding the collateral value of various under performing loans may affect the level and allocation of the allowance for credit losses in future periods 
the allowance may also be affected by trends in the amount of charge offs experienced or expected trends within different loan portfolios 
the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non performing loans was as of december  there were no non performing loans as of december  management believes the allowance at december  is adequate based upon its ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio  historical loss trends and other factors 
however  no assurance can be given that the company may not sustain charge offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period 
deposits and borrowings total deposits increased  or to  as of december  compared to  as of december  interest bearing deposits increased  or to  as of december  compared to  as of december  non interest bearing deposits increased  or to  as of december  compared to  as of december  the increase in deposits attributable to the bmc merger is approximately  the remaining growth is consistent with our strategy to grow our core deposit base and has occurred because of growth in our retail banking offices 
in the merger with bmc we acquired branches located in oakhurst and madera  california 
we plan to open an additional branch in the first quarter of in downtown fresno  california

the loan bears interest indexed to prime or libor  at the company s election 
further terms and conditions of the loan agreement were outlined in report on form k filed on december  the purpose of the borrowing was to ensure the bank s capital ratios remain at or above well capitalized after the effective date of the merger with bmc 
refer to note to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
capital our stockholders equity increased to  as of december  compared to  as of december  the increase in stockholders equity is a result of net income of  for combined with the increase in common stock from the merger with bmc  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
during the period the company s borrowings remains outstanding  which is expected to be until approximately  the bank does not anticipate paying dividends to the company except for dividends that are necessary to meet the ordinary and usual operating expenses of the company provided that the bank would not pay any dividend that would cause it to be deemed not well capitalized under applicable banking laws and regulations 
management considers capital requirements as part of its strategic planning process 
the strategic plan calls for continuing increases in assets and liabilities  and the capital required may therefore be in excess of retained earnings 
the ability to obtain capital is dependent upon the capital markets as well as our performance 
management regularly evaluates sources of capital and the timing required to meet its strategic objectives

our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by our management and director s asset liability committees 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet commitments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and  to a lesser extent  broker deposits  federal funds facilities and advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine maturities and paydowns of securities from the securities portfolio  the stability of our core deposits and the ability to sell investment securities 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  origination and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
as a means of augmenting our liquidity  we have established federal funds lines with correspondent banks 
at december  our available borrowing capacity includes approximately  in federal funds lines with our correspondent banks and  in unused fhlb advances 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate 
at december   we were not aware of any information that was reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position

off balance sheet items in the ordinary course of business  the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance risk 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk irr and credit risk constitute the two greatest sources of financial exposure for insured financial institutions 
irr represents the impact that changes in absolute and relative levels of market interest rates may have upon our net interest income nii 
changes in the nii are the result of changes in the net interest spread between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities timing risk  the relationship between various rates basis risk  and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
we realize income principally from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investments  other interest earning assets and the interest incurred on deposits and borrowings 
the volumes and yields on loans  deposits and borrowings are affected by market interest rates 
as of december   of our loan portfolio was tied to adjustable rate indices 
the majority of these adjustable rate loans are tied to prime and reprice within days 
the majority of our time deposits have a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   of our time deposits mature within one year or less 
as of december    of our long term debt was fixed rate with an average remaining term of years and  of long term debt reprices on a quarterly basis 
changes in the market level of interest rates directly and immediately affect our interest spread  and therefore profitability 
sharp and significant changes to market rates can cause the interest spread to shrink or expand significantly in the near term  principally because of the timing differences between the adjustable rate loans and the maturities and therefore repricing of the deposits and borrowings 
our management and board of director s asset liability committees alco are responsible for managing our assets and liabilities in a manner that balances profitability  irr and various other risks including liquidity 
the alco operates under policies and within risk limits prescribed by  reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
the alco seeks to stabilize our nii by matching rate sensitive assets and liabilities through maintaining the maturity and repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment 
when the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds rate sensitive assets within specified time periods  nii generally will be negatively impacted by an increasing interest rate environment and positively impacted by a decreasing interest rate environment 
conversely  when the amount of rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of rate sensitive liabilities within specified time periods  net interest income will generally be positively impacted by an increasing interest rate environment and negatively impacted by a decreasing interest rate environment 
the speed and velocity of the repricing of assets and liabilities will also contribute to the effects on our nii  as will the presence or absence of periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors 
simulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes 
earnings simulations are produced using a software model that is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of our financial instruments and incorporate market based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on current volumes of applicable financial instruments 
interest rate simulations provide us with an estimate of both the dollar amount and percentage change in nii under various rate scenarios 
all assets and liabilities are normally subjected to up to basis point increases and decreases in interest rates in basis point increments 
under each interest rate scenario  we project our net interest income 
from these results  we can then develop alternatives in dealing with the tolerance thresholds 
approximately of our loan portfolio is tied to adjustable rate indices and of our loan portfolio reprices within days 
as of december   we had commercial and real estate loans totaling  with floors ranging from to and ceilings ranging from to 
in the current rate environment  the number of loans affected by floors and ceilings is minimal 
the following table shows the effects of changes in projected net interest income for the twelve months ending december  under the interest rate shock scenarios stated 
the table was prepared as of december   at which time prime interest rate was 
sensitivity analysis of impact on interest income of rate changes hypothetical change in rates projected net interest income change from rates at dec 
 change from rates at dec 
 dollars in thousands up bp up bp up bp unchanged down bp down bp down bp assumptions are inherently uncertain  and  consequently  the model cannot precisely measure net interest income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies which might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations 
in the model above  the simulation shows that the company is neutral over the one year horizon 
if interest rates increase or decline  there will be similar positive and negative impact to net interest income 
there is no material change in our current market risk exposure from the market risk exposure we experienced in critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
our significant accounting policies are described in detail in note in the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
not all of the significant accounting policies presented in note of the audited consolidated financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgements or estimates 
use of estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates used 
estimates are based upon historical experience  current economic conditions and other factors that management considers reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates result in judgements regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities when these values are not readily available from other sources  as well as assessing and identifying the accounting treatments of contingencies and commitments 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
we follow accounting policies typical to the commercial banking industry and in compliance with various regulation and guidelines as established by the public company accounting oversight board pcaob  financial accounting standards board fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  and the bank s primary federal regulator  the fdic 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgements 
allowance for credit losses our most significant management accounting estimate is the appropriate level for the allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is established to absorb known and inherent losses attributable to loans outstanding 
the adequacy of the allowance is monitored on an on going basis and is based on our management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience and other pertinent information 
the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is by nature inexact  as the allowance represents our management s best estimate of the losses inherent in our credit portfolios at the reporting date 
these credit losses will occur in the future  and as such cannot be determined with absolute certainty at the reporting date 
amortization of premiums on investments we invest in collateralized mortgage obligations cmo and mortgage backed securities  mbs as part of the overall strategy to increase our net interest margin 
cmos and mbs by their nature react to changes in interest rates 
in a declining rate environment  prepayments from mbs and cmos would be expected to increase and the expected life of the investment would be expected to shorten 
conversely  if interest rates increase  prepayments would be expected to decline and the average life of the mbs and cmos would be expected to extend 
premium amortization of these investments affects our net interest income 
our management monitors the prepayment speed of these investments and adjusts premium amortization based on several factors 
these factors include the type of investment  the investment structure  interest rates  interest rates on new mortgage loans  expectation of interest rate changes  current economic conditions  level of principal remaining on the bond  the bond coupon rate  the bond origination date  and volume of available bonds in market 
the calculation of premium amortization is by nature inexact  and represents management s best estimate of principal paydowns inherent in the total investment portfolio 
goodwill business combinations involving the company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  goodwill is assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually 
while the company believes all assumptions utilized in its assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes could cause the company to record impairment in the future 
stock based compensation under accounting practice bulletin no  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount required to be paid to the company by the optionee upon exercising the option 
because our stock option plan provides for the issuance of options at a price of no less than the fair market value at the date of the grant  no compensation cost is required to be recognized for the stock option plan on the date of the grant 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
inflation the impact of inflation on a financial institution differs significantly from that exerted on other industries primarily because the assets and liabilities of financial institutions consist largely of monetary items 
however  financial institutions are affected by inflation in part through non interest expenses  such as salaries and occupancy expenses  and to some extent by changes in interest rates 
at december   we do not believe that inflation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  if inflation concerns cause short term rates to rise in the near future  we may benefit by immediate repricing of a majority of our loan portfolio
