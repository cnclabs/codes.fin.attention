executive overview we design  manufacture and service sophisticated machinery and systems for customers in the energy  food processing and air transportation industries 
we have manufacturing operations in countries and are strategically located to facilitate delivery of our products and services to our customers 
we operate energy systems comprising energy production systems and energy processing systems  foodtech and airport systems business segments 
our business segments serve diverse industries with a wide customer base 
we focus on economic and industry specific drivers and key risk factors affecting each of our business segments as we formulate our strategic plans and make decisions related to allocating capital and human resources 
the following discussion provides examples of the kinds of economic and industry factors and key risks that we consider 
the results of our energy systems businesses are primarily driven by changes in exploration and production spending by oil and gas companies  which in part depend upon current and anticipated future crude oil and natural gas prices and production volumes 
fluctuations in raw material prices  such as the increase in steel prices in recent years  affect product costs in many of our energy systems business units 
however  in most of these business units  we have been able to pass on steel cost increases to our customers 
our energy production systems business is affected by trends in land and offshore oil and gas production  including shallow and deepwater output 
additionally  given the substantial capital investments required from our customers to complete an offshore project  our customers overall profitability influences our results 
our energy processing systems business results reflect spending by oilfield service companies and engineering construction companies for equipment and systems that facilitate the measurement and transportation of crude oil and natural gas 
the level of production activity worldwide influences spending decisions  and we use rig count as one indicator of demand 
our foodtech business results reflect the level of capital investment being made by our food processing customers 
the level of capital spending also is influenced by changing consumer preferences  public perception of food safety  conditions in the agricultural sector that affect commodity prices  and by our customers overall profitability 
foodtech revenues include variable rentals from equipment leases  such as citrus extractors 
the hurricanes in florida in the last few years have devastated citrus crops in that region  which has adversely affected our variable rentals from extractor leases 
foodtech volumes also may fluctuate as a result of consolidation of customers in the commercial food processing industry 

table of contents the results of our airport systems business are highly dependent upon the profitability of our customers in the airline and air cargo markets 
their profitability is affected by fluctuations in passenger and freight traffic and the volatility of operating expenses  including the impact of costs related to labor  fuel and airline security 
in addition  results in our airport systems business are influenced by the level of purchases by the us air force  which depend upon governmental funding approvals 
similar to energy production systems  rising steel prices have increased costs in airport systems  especially in our jetway business 
changes in significant raw material prices  such as steel  will continue to impact our airport systems results 
we also focus on key risk factors when determining our overall strategy and making decisions for allocating capital 
these factors include risks associated with the global economic outlook  product obsolescence  and the competitive environment 
we address these risks in our business strategies  which incorporate continuing development of leading edge technologies  cultivating strong customer relationships  and implementing strategic international expansion 
in  we continued to emphasize technological advancement in all of our segments 
in energy production systems  we continued the development of an all electric subsea production system  which allows for more efficient production in ultra deep waters than conventional systems which rely on hydraulics 
several emerging technologies began the transition from testing to commercial introduction including subsea processing and separation  riserless light well intervention rlwi  and through tubing rotary drilling completion 
the oil and gas industry responded well to energy processing systems introduction of a higher capacity pump product line 
foodtech launched a variety of new products during designed to advance food quality and safety and lower costs  including products used by poultry and other food processors and food packagers 
further  we enhanced existing products to meet the changing needs in the food processing and handling industries 
in  airport systems began developing a line of equipment designed to service larger new planes such as the a aircraft 
we are committed to continuing our investments in technological innovations to expand our technology base  develop new products and increase profitability 
we have developed close working relationships with our customers in all of our business segments 
our energy production systems business results reflect our ability to build long term alliances with oil and gas companies that are actively engaged in offshore deepwater development  and provide solutions to their needs in a timely and cost effective manner 
we have formed similar collaborative relationships with oilfield service companies in energy processing systems  air cargo companies in airport systems and citrus processors in foodtech 
we believe that by working closely with our customers we enhance our competitive advantage  strengthen our market positions and improve our results 
in all of our segments  we serve customers from around the world 
during  of our total sales were to non us locations 
we evaluate international markets and pursue opportunities that fit our business model 
for example  we have targeted opportunities in west africa and the asia pacific region because of the offshore drilling potential in those regions  and we are positioning ourselves to compete in the market for jetway passenger boarding bridges in asia  china  russia and the middle east 
as we evaluate our operating results  we view our business segments by product line and consider performance indicators like segment revenues  operating profit and capital employed  in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog 
a significant and growing proportion of our revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  while our payments for such arrangements are generally received according to milestones achieved under stated contract terms 
consequently  the timing of revenue recognition is not correlated with the timing of customer payments 
we may structure our contracts to receive advance payments which we may use to fund inventory purchases 
working capital excluding cash and net debt are therefore key performance indicators of cash flows

while all of our business segments generated higher revenue in  the increase is primarily due to continued growth in energy production systems  which was up compared to the prior year 
we continue to benefit from the growing demand for the supply of oilfield related equipment  especially in subsea systems  used in the major oil and gas producing regions throughout the world 
airport systems experienced a growth in annual sales  which resulted from improved ground support equipment and services demand 
of the total increase in sales  million was attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
cost of sales for the year ended december  increased over both in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales 
cost of sales totaled of sales  up from in the million provision for losses on our contract with sonatrach trc  the algerian oil and gas company sonatrach recorded in  which was million higher than the provision  was the primary driver of the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales 
of the total increase in cost of sales  million was attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased compared to  but declined as a percentage of sales from in to in higher costs in our energy production systems businesses were primarily responsible for the increase  the result of a higher level of bid and proposal activities and the impact of increased headcount required to support growth in this business segment 
of the total increase in selling  general and administrative expense  million was attributable to the impact of foreign currency translation 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we sold our investment in common stock of modec  inc and our interest in the gtl microsystems joint venture  which together represented a pre tax gain of million 
these gains were less than the million gain on conversion of our investment in modec international llc that we recorded in the fourth quarter of our pre tax income benefited from the absence of an asset impairment charge in we recognized a million goodwill impairment charge related to our blending and transfer product line in net interest expense for the year ended december  was lower compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of higher interest income 
income tax expense for the year ended december  resulted in an effective income tax rate of  compared to an effective rate of for the increase in effective tax rate is attributable to million in incremental tax expense recorded in related to repatriating foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
this effect was partially offset by lower domestic taxable earnings as a result of lower investment gains  higher sonatrach project losses in and the correction of an immaterial error in resulting in a reduction in income tax expense of million 

table of contents compared with our total revenue for the year ended december  increased by  primarily due to continued growth in our energy systems businesses 
in  our technological capabilities enabled us to continue to benefit from the growing demand for the supply of equipment used in the major oil and gas producing regions throughout the world 
to a lesser extent  the increase in revenue also reflected higher revenue in the airport systems business segment 
of the total increase in sales  million was attributable to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
cost of sales for the year ended december  increased compared with cost of sales totaled of sales  up from in the increase in cost of sales resulted primarily from higher sales volumes during the impact of foreign currency translation and a provision for anticipated losses on our contract with sonatrach were responsible for million and million of the increase  respectively  in cost of sales 
these increases in cost were partially offset by the positive impact of cost saving measures and a more favorable product mix in selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year 
unfavorable changes in foreign currency translation represented million of the increase 
the remaining increase reflected higher employee related costs associated with business expansion  especially in our energy production systems business segment 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses were of sales  down from of sales in pre tax income in increased primarily as a result of a million gain million after tax on the conversion of our investment in modec international llc  and the positive impact of higher sales volumes 
in addition  net income reflected the benefit of tax adjustments of million resulting from a favorable judgment in a tax dispute and the resolution of foreign tax audits in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by a loss provision in energy production systems of million million after tax on the sonatrach project  mainly due to the effect of severe weather conditions 
in energy processing systems  a million impairment charge million after tax was required to write off goodwill associated with the blending and transfer product line 
lower operating profit from foodtech also contributed to the unfavorable comparison 
the gain on conversion of our investment in modec international llc was associated with our decision to exchange our interest in modec international llc for cash and shares of common stock of modec  inc modec international llc was a joint venture investment between fmc technologies and a subsidiary of modec  inc the joint venture agreement gave us the right to convert our ownership beginning in modec international llc was part of the energy production systems business segment 
the gain on conversion of our interest in the joint venture is not included in our measure of segment operating profit 
when compared with the prior year  net interest expense decreased in  primarily attributable to lower average debt levels 
income tax expense for the year ended december  resulted in an effective tax rate of 
an effective tax rate of was realized in in  we realized tax benefits related to the settlement of a tax dispute with fmc corporation and the closure of several tax audits 
the differences between the effective tax rates for these years and the statutory us federal income tax rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates  taxes on intercompany dividends and deemed dividends for tax purposes  the settlement of the tax dispute and audits  and non deductible expenses

not meaningful energy production systems compared with energy production systems revenue was higher in compared to segment revenue is affected by trends in land and offshore oil and gas exploration and production  including shallow and deepwater development 
favorable shifts in these factors have contributed to higher revenue from sales of subsea systems and surface products 
revenue from sales of subsea systems of billion in grew by million  or  from billion in approximately million of the increase in subsea revenue was attributable to favorable foreign currency translation 
subsea volumes increased primarily as a result of progress on new and ongoing projects located offshore west africa  brazil and the north sea 
we experienced a reduction in sales of floating production systems  primarily relating to progress on the sonatrach project  which had sales of million and million in and  respectively 
the remainder of the increase in revenue reflects higher demand for surface products primarily due to favorable market conditions for land based drilling 

table of contents energy production systems generated an operating profit of million in  which represented an increase of million compared to our earnings were significantly impacted in both years by losses on the sonatrach contract 
segment operating profit for energy production systems included the following related to the sonatrach project year ended december  in millions favorable unfavorable revenue costs incurred losses from sonatrach contract the sonatrach contract involves the supply and installation of offshore oil loading systems at three locations 
during  we recognized a million provision for losses due to an increase in the estimate of our total project costs 
during  we increased our estimate of costs to complete the contract by million due to customer caused delays resulting in extended testing and higher installation and project management costs 
subsequent to december  we completed final testing of the installed equipment and received customer acceptance under the contract 
excluding the sonatrach loss  operating profit increased million during higher sales volumes contributed million in incremental profit 
a decrease in profit margins as a result of an unfavorable change in the project and geographic mix lowered earnings by million 
our projects in certain locations  particularly west africa  have increased demands for local content  and the contractual requirements for sourcing limit our abilities to bid for supply of certain items 
we incurred million in incremental selling  general and administrative expenses in primarily reflective of higher business activity levels 
the impact of foreign currency translation on the segment operating profit was minimal as the favorable effect on revenue was offset by similar increases in expenses 
compared with energy production systems revenue was higher in than in the same period in  with growth in subsea systems  floating production systems and  to a lesser extent  the surface business 
revenue from sales of subsea systems of billion in increased million  or  from million in  of which million related to higher volumes and million to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
subsea volumes increased primarily as a result of new and ongoing projects located offshore brazil  the north sea  asia pacific and offshore west africa  partially offset by a reduction in projects in the gulf of mexico 
floating production systems revenues grew by million over the same period in the prior year 
this was primarily attributable to higher revenue associated with the sonatrach project  which increased million to a total of million in energy production systems operating profit increased compared with  with higher volumes and favorable margins in our subsea and surface businesses more than offsetting the impact of higher selling  general and administrative expense and period costs related to the sonatrach project 
operating profit from subsea systems grew from as a result of higher sales volumes and improved margins 
the increase in subsea systems was offset by a decline in operating profit at our floating production systems business compared to  which was primarily the result of million in pre tax provisions recorded for losses on the sonatrach project 
to a lesser extent  energy production systems operating profit increased as a result of higher sales volumes and margins in the surface business 
selling  general and administrative expense were higher in compared to the prior year  attributable to increased bid and proposal costs and variable selling expenses  such as commissions 
outlook for for  we are expecting another year of growth in operating profit in our energy production systems business 
this expectation is based on our backlog of orders in subsea systems and forecasts of favorable market conditions  including continued high oil and gas prices and increased rig activity worldwide 
our results included million in losses on the sonatrach project 

table of contents energy processing systems compared with energy processing systems revenue was higher in compared to primarily as a result of higher demand for weco chiksan equipment  which is sold primarily to service companies 
approximately of the increase in revenue is attributable to higher prices for fluid control products 
high oil and gas prices as well as the continuing growth in land based drilling activity rig counts generated the increase in demand 
volume from other product lines in this segment was approximately in line with results 
energy processing systems operating profit in increased compared to primarily as a result of higher volume million  the absence of asset impairment charges recorded in million  and more effective execution million 
the volume increases reflect the higher demand for fluid control equipment 
in addition  we redirected our focus in the loading systems business to become more selective in our pursuit of certain marine arm projects 
we also re engineered many internal processes which resulted in improved execution 
additionally  we restructured certain operations and began outsourcing activities for which we have realized cost efficiencies 
the effect of these efforts was to significantly increase our margins when compared to the benefit of price increases implemented in was primarily offset by increased raw material costs 
compared with energy processing systems revenue was higher in compared with  with sales of measurement and material handling equipment contributing million and million  respectively  to the increase 
strong demand for measurement equipment for pipeline and tank truck applications was driven by the level of oil and gas prices  while higher sales of material handling equipment resulted primarily from increased demand for the bulk conveying systems needed for coal fired power generation 
in addition  the favorable impact of foreign currency translation accounted for million of the increase in segment revenue 
fluid control reported slightly higher revenue in  as a million increase in sales reflecting weco chiksan product demand was almost completely offset by a decrease in sales of production manifold systems  the latter resulting from competitive pressure 
the growth in sales of the weco chiksan product line continued to reflect the impact of strong land based drilling activity in the us energy processing systems operating profit was lower in compared with  mainly as a result of a fourth quarter goodwill impairment charge amounting to million associated with the blending and transfer product line 
also contributing to lower segment operating profit was a million decrease in loading systems margins  reflecting competitive pressure and higher operating costs 
the positive impact of higher volumes on profitability in material handling and measurement equipment  which amounted to million and million  respectively  partially offset the decrease in segment operating profit 
the goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax eliminated all remaining goodwill associated with the blending and transfer business 
we experienced a lack of inbound orders in the blending and transfer product line for a sustained period of time 
this was due  in part  to the volatility of oil and gas prices  which reduced the willingness of oil companies to invest capital to upgrade existing blending facilities or to invest in new blending capacity 
outlook for in  we expect energy processing systems to deliver overall growth in operating profit over increases are expected from fluid control and loading systems as a result of continued high market demand 
material handling systems should also generate higher profits due to increased bulk conveying project revenues  driven by increased coal fired power generation 
foodtech compared with foodtech s revenue increased by  or million  in compared with  with increased volume from domestic customers in the poultry processing and other food handling industries of approximately million  offset primarily by lower volumes in tomato processing equipment of approximately million 
additionally  foreign currency translation decreased our revenue by million in compared to operating profit remained consistent with results 
sales volume and margin growth in poultry processing and freezing equipment generated an increase in profits over the prior year 
the margin increase is a result of a shift toward higher margin projects and improved project execution 
however  profits declined for both citrus and tomato processing equipment lines as a result of reduced volume attributable to the effects of an unusually low florida citrus crop  resulting from the hurricanes in 
table of contents  and low capital investment of the tomato processing market 
additionally  foreign currency translation decreased profits by million in compared to compared with foodtech revenue for was essentially flat compared with higher volumes of freezing  portioning and cooking equipment in were responsible for an increase of million in revenue  reflecting stronger demand in the north american and asian markets 
in addition  year over year changes in foreign currency translation resulted in a million increase in revenue 
these increases were largely offset by the million negative impact on revenue resulting from lower volumes of fruit and vegetable processing equipment  primarily reflecting a decline in the global market for tomato processing equipment 
to a lesser extent  the increase in foodtech revenue was also offset by lower volumes of canning and citrus systems and the impact on revenue of the divestiture of our us agricultural harvester product line in the fourth quarter of foodtech s operating profit was lower in compared with  with a decrease of million attributable to lower citrus volumes  and an additional million decrease resulting from lower volumes of other fruit and vegetable processing equipment 
the decline in profitability was partially offset by a million increase in the freezing  portioning and cooking equipment businesses  primarily attributable to the positive impact of reduced expenses 
outlook for our foodtech operating profit is expected to be higher in as compared to results 
we anticipate a volume increase and improved profitability in our food processing equipment product lines  primarily sterilization and canning equipment 
additionally  we expect sustained investment in the poultry processing product lines with continued emphasis on margin improvements 
airport systems compared with airport systems revenue was higher in the year ended december  compared with the prior year 
segment sales are affected by the profitability of our customers in the airline and air cargo markets 
almost all of the increase is from increased sales of ground support equipment to domestic freight carriers  ground handlers and international airlines 
our airport services business provided an incremental million in revenue for  primarily as the result of project work for the dallas  houston and philadelphia airports 
sales of halvorsen loaders declined  consistent with our forecast for halvorsen loader shipments 
deliveries declined from units in to units in sales of halvorsen loaders fluctuate based on the status of governmental approval of funding and the requirements of the us air force 
sales of jetway passenger boarding bridges were flat for the year as softness in the domestic passenger boarding bridge market during the fourth quarter of offset the sales improvements experienced in the prior quarters 
airport systems operating profit in the year ended december  increased compared with the prior year  primarily attributable to volume increases for ground support equipment and airport services  which generated an incremental million in operating profit in additionally  airport systems benefited from a million gain on the sale of excess land adjacent to one of our facilities 
the profit improvement was partially offset by reduced profits for halvorsen loaders  driven by the decline in sales volume 
compared with airport systems revenue increased in compared with higher revenues from sales of jetway passenger boarding bridges and ground support equipment each represented million of the increase 
stronger sales of jetway passenger boarding bridges reflected increased deliveries to domestic airlines and  to a lesser extent  airport authorities 
ground support equipment revenue increased as a result of higher sales to ground handlers and cargo handling companies  primarily in north america  and the positive impact of foreign currency translation of million 
airport services sales grew by million over the same period in the prior year due to new projects in the dallas and los angeles airports 
these increases were partially offset by the million decrease in halvorsen loader revenue  as deliveries decreased from units in to units in airport systems operating profit in increased compared with  primarily attributable to the volume increases in jetway and ground support equipment  which contributed to million in incremental operating profit for the year 
reduced volume in halvorsen loaders caused a million decrease in operating profit for 
table of contents outlook for we are projecting operating profit at airport systems for to be consistent with results 
we expect growth in our commercial businesses  principally the ground support equipment business  to offset the absence of the land sale gain recognized in corporate items compared with gains on sales of investments reflect the following transactions from and in november  we received proceeds from modec  inc of million in exchange for our interest in modec international llc and recorded a gain of million 
the proceeds consisted of billion yen  or million  and million common shares of modec  inc  valued at million at the transaction date 
in september  we sold our shares in modec  inc for million  resulting in a million gain 
also in  we recognized a gain of million on the sale of our interest in the gtl microsystems joint venture 
corporate expense for the year ended december  grew by over the prior year  primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense 
other expense  net  increased by million compared to the prior year period primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses 
the increase also reflects million higher lifo expense and million in increased stock based compensation expense in these increases were partially offset by  among other things  a reduction in insurance reserves reflecting favorable benefit claim experience 
compared with in november  we received proceeds from modec  inc of million in exchange for our interest in modec international llc and recorded a gain of million million after tax 
corporate expense in was higher when compared with the prior year  due primarily to higher sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
the decrease in other expense  net  from the prior year is attributable to million in lower stock based compensation expense  million in reduced costs related to our outsourcing of employee benefits administration and million in favorable changes in foreign currency hedging results 
these declines were partially offset by a million increase in pension expense caused by lower discount rate and asset return assumptions 
outlook for our corporate expense is expected to be consistent with results 
other expense  net  will likely reflect higher stock based compensation expense 
we do not currently anticipate any significant gains on asset disposals 
net interest expense should decline as we continue to reduce our net debt and recognize interest income on cash investments in inbound orders and order backlog inbound orders represent the estimated sales value of confirmed customer orders received during the reporting period 
inbound orders year ended december  in millions energy production systems energy processing systems intercompany eliminations subtotal energy systems foodtech airport systems intercompany eliminations total inbound orders 
table of contents order backlog is calculated as the estimated sales value of unfilled  confirmed customer orders at the reporting date 
order backlog december  in millions energy production systems energy processing systems intercompany eliminations subtotal energy systems foodtech airport systems intercompany eliminations total order backlog the portion of total order backlog at december  that we project will be recorded as revenue after fiscal year is approximately million 
energy production systems order backlog at december  grew compared to the prior year reflecting increased orders for subsea systems  which reached billion for  and the timing of project execution 
subsea order backlog at december  included projects associated with all of the major offshore oil and gas producing regions  and included chevron s agbami project offshore nigeria and bp s block greater plutonio project offshore angola 
surface wellhead orders have increased by during  also contributing to the overall increase in backlog compared to foreign currency translation  however  negatively impacted the december  balance of backlog by million compared to december  energy processing systems order backlog at december  more than doubled relative to the prior year as all of our product lines showed year over year increases 
inbound orders grew by compared to  supported by increases in all of our product lines 
the increase in orders is primarily attributable to continued expansion in land based drilling activities  which creates demand for our fluid control products 
additionally  we have seen strong demand for our material handling products  including a million order received in december for bulk material handling systems related to power generation 
foodtech s order backlog at december  declined compared with the prior year as a result of lower orders for tomato processing equipment in the current year  which is attributed to lower capital spending in the industry 
order backlog for freezing and cooking equipment  which historically has represented the largest share of this segment s backlog  was flat relative to the prior year 
airport systems order backlog at december  declined compared with the prior year  primarily as a result of a reduction in the order backlog for halvorsen loaders 
to a lesser extent  order backlog declined with deliveries of the initial rampsnake orders in liquidity and capital resources at december   our net debt was million  compared with net debt of million at december  net debt includes short and long term debt and the current portion of long term debt  net of cash and cash equivalents 
in  we experienced significant growth in our energy systems businesses 
as a result  we invested in working capital and made capital expenditures to support our expanding businesses 
this spending contributed to our increase in net debt in during the fourth quarter of  we executed our plan to repatriate foreign earnings to the us under the jobs act 
to fund a portion of the repatriation plan  we restructured our external financing by shifting from domestic to foreign debt 
this shift included the initiation of a new million five year revolving credit facility by fmc technologies bv  a wholly owned subsidiary in the netherlands  and draws of million on this facility during the fourth quarter 
the foreign earnings were remitted to the us through fourth quarter dividends 
these proceeds will be used to fund domestic investments in accordance with the reinvestment plan approved by our board of directors 

table of contents cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended december   were as follows year ended december  in millions cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations operating cash required by discontinued operations cash provided required by investing activities cash provided required by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating cash flows operating activities of continuing operations consumed million in  compared to providing million in the prior year 
higher investments in inventory  mostly in our energy systems businesses  represented a use of cash of million in and were the primary contributor to the decline in cash flows from operating activities 
cash was also used in to fund income tax payments  including approximately million for previously accrued income taxes in norway and million for taxes on the foreign earnings repatriated under the jobs act 
cash required by discontinued operations cash required by discontinued operations in declined relative to the preceding two years 
these cash outflows represent payments for claims  claims administration and insurance coverage for product liabilities associated with equipment which had been manufactured by our discontinued businesses 
the decrease in cash requirements is attributable to higher payments during and to settle outstanding claims 
investing cash flows cash provided by investing activities in was million  compared to cash required by investing activities of million in the fluctuation is primarily attributable to two factors 
we generated million in higher proceeds from the sale of assets in  which included million from sales of our shares of modec  inc and our interest in the gtl microsystems joint venture  than  which included the million cash inflow from the conversion of our interest in modec international llc 
this increase in cash inflows was partially offset by million in higher capital spending in  which rose to support our subsea business expansion in malaysia  nigeria and angola 
financing cash flows cash provided by financing activities was million for  compared to cash required by financing activities of million for our borrowings increased in the fourth quarter of as we incurred foreign debt to fund our repatriation of foreign earnings under the provisions of the jobs act 
however  we also repaid our outstanding commercial paper borrowings during the fourth quarter 
on a net basis  we had proceeds of million from borrowings in  compared to net payments of debt obligations of million in the prior year 
the net cash inflow from debt was partially offset by our purchase of million of treasury shares for additionally  we received million less in proceeds from the issuance of stock during  which was the result of fewer option exercises than the prior year 
debt and liquidity total borrowings at december  and  comprised the following december  in millions revolving credit facilities commercial paper uncommitted credit facilities property financing other total borrowings 
table of contents under the commercial paper program  and subject to available capacity under our million committed revolving credit facility  we have the ability to access up to million of short term financing through our commercial paper dealers 
the following is a summary of our credit facilities at december  in millions description commitment amount debt outstanding commercial paper outstanding letters of credit unused capacity maturity a b five year revolving credit facility november five year revolving credit facility november c three year revolving credit facility december a our available capacity under our million five year revolving credit facility is reduced by any outstanding commercial paper 
b the million five year revolving credit facility allows us to obtain a total of million in standby letters of credit 
our available capacity is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit associated with this facility 
c outstanding borrowings on the million five year revolving credit facility as of may convert to a term loan due and payable in a lump sum in november the unused portion of the facility at the conversion date will not be available for draws subsequent to this date 
we expect to renegotiate the facility to maintain our overall credit availability 
our revolving credit facilities provide the ability to refinance our short term borrowings on a long term basis  therefore  at december  we classified our borrowings on revolving credit facilities as long term on our consolidated balance sheet 
among other restrictions  the terms of the committed credit agreements include negative covenants related to liens and financial covenants related to debt to earnings ratios and interest coverage ratios 
we are in compliance with all covenants as of december  our million and million five year revolving credit facilities maturing in november bear interest  based on our election  at either a a base rate determined by reference to the higher of the agent s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus of or b an interest rate of basis points above the london interbank offered rate libor 
the margin over libor is variable and is determined based on the company s debt rating 
the three year revolving credit facility bears interest at either the canadian dollar prime rate or bankers acceptance rate 
we have interest rate swaps related to million of our variable rate debt 
the effect of these interest rate swaps  which were entered into during december and mature in june  is to fix the effective annual interest rate on these borrowings at 
our interest expense for the million in variable rate debt subject to the interest rate swaps will reflect a lower effective rate through june prior to entering into the new interest rate swaps  we sold our existing interest rate swaps  which had fixed the interest rate for million of our variable rate debt 
an unrealized million gain will be amortized against the interest expense on the underlying debt through the original maturity of the swaps in june therefore  after taking into account the amortization of the deferred gain  the effective interest rate on million of our variable rate borrowings will be approximately 
our uncommitted credit relates primarily to international lines of credit 
borrowings under these uncommitted facilities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we entered into a sale leaseback agreement during the third quarter of we sold a building for million in net proceeds  which were used to reduce other balance sheet debt 
we are accounting for the transaction as a financing and are amortizing the obligation using an effective annual interest rate of over the lease term of ten years 
our annual payments associated with this obligation total million 
other domestic and international borrowings totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents outlook for for  we estimate capital expenditures will be in the range of million  compared with capital spending of million 
the anticipated increase in spending is primarily attributable to ongoing work to support our subsea operations 
we are pursuing claims against sonatrach related to costs that we incurred due to customer caused work stoppages  work required beyond the contract scope and other customer caused delays 
we have not recognized the value of these claims in our financial statements 
while we believe we have a contractual basis to pursue these claims  we expect to engage in further negotiations with sonatrach and cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations nor their timing 
should the company and sonatrach not be able to reach resolution  the contract requires that disputes be resolved through arbitration before an international tribunal in paris  france under international chamber of commerce rules 
it is possible that sonatrach may draw upon a letter of credit we established with one of our lenders to support potential warranty claims on a recently completed project 
the maximum potential cash amount that could be drawn under this letter of credit would be million and the contingency expires in february we believe cash from operations and our credit facilities will fund a drawdown if necessary 
we are authorized to repurchase up to two million shares of our common stock 
we announced plans to begin the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock in february  and during  we repurchased  shares for approximately million 
in february  the board of directors approved the repurchase of an additional five million shares of the company s issued and outstanding common stock 
the timing and amount of further repurchases will depend on market conditions 
we currently expect to contribute approximately million to our non us pension plans in we plan to meet our cash requirements in with cash generated from operations 
additionally  we expect to generate free cash flows  which will allow us to pay off a portion of our outstanding debt and acquire short term investments 
we continue to evaluate acquisitions  divestitures and joint ventures in the ordinary course of business 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total payments less than year years years after years long term debt a short term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations b acquisition related obligations c total contractual obligations a our available long term debt is dependent upon our compliance with covenants  including negative covenants related to liens  and financial covenants related to debt to earnings and interest coverage ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december   however  any violation of covenants  other events of default  or changes in our credit rating could have a material impact on our ability to maintain our committed financing arrangements 
b in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with our suppliers to purchase raw materials or services 
these agreements include a requirement that our supplier provide products or services to our specifications and require us to make a firm purchase commitment to our supplier 
as substantially all of these commitments are associated with purchases made to fulfill our customers orders  the costs associated with these agreements will ultimately be reflected in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income 
c acquisition related obligations include the remaining amount owed associated with the acquisition of the rampsnake product line 
in addition  we also have a commitment to acquire the remaining ownership interest in cds in at a purchase price of slightly less than times the average of of cds and earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
at the current time  we are unable to estimate the amount of this commitment 

table of contents the following is a summary of other off balance sheet arrangements at december  amount of commitment expiration per period in millions other off balance sheet arrangements total amount less than year years years after years letters of credit and bank guarantees surety bonds third party guarantees total other off balance sheet arrangements as collateral for our performance on certain sales contracts or as part of our agreements with insurance companies  we are contingently liable under letters of credit  surety bonds and other bank guarantees 
in order to obtain these financial instruments  we pay fees to various financial institutions in amounts competitively determined in the marketplace 
our ability to generate revenue from certain contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain these off balance sheet financial instruments 
these off balance sheet financial instruments may be renewed  revised or released based on changes in the underlying commitment 
historically  our commercial commitments have not been drawn upon to a material extent  consequently  management believes it is not likely that there will be claims against these commitments that will have a negative impact on our key financial ratios or our ability to obtain financing 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in order to manage and mitigate our exposure to these risks  we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments where the objective is to generate profits solely from trading activities 
at december  and  our derivative holdings consisted of foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements 
these forward looking disclosures only address potential impacts from market risks as they affect our financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices or equity prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk when we sell or purchase products or services  transactions are frequently denominated in currencies other than the particular operation s functional currency 
generally  we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency transactions to the extent that a natural hedge exists 
when foreign currency exposures exist  we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties 
our hedging policy is designed to reduce the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements  and we expect any gain or loss in the hedging portfolio to be offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposure being hedged 
we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates 
we also hedge firmly committed  anticipated transactions in the normal course of business 
the majority of these hedging instruments mature during we use a sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on derivative instrument fair values of an immediate adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar and all other variables are held constant 
we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments will offset the changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
to the extent that our derivative instruments are hedging anticipated transactions  a increase in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease of million in the net fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  changes in the derivative fair value will not have an impact on our results of operations unless these contracts are deemed to be ineffective 
interest rate risk our debt instruments subject us to market risk associated with movements in interest rates 
in june  we entered into three floating to fixed interest rate swaps related to million of our commercial paper borrowings 
the effect of these interest rate swaps was to fix the effective annual interest rate on these borrowings at an average rate of 
in the fourth quarter of  we paid our commercial paper borrowings and issued variable rate debt 
we sold the existing interest rate swaps and deferred a gain of million on the qualified hedged transaction 
we were issued new swaps with an average 
table of contents fixed interest rate of until the interest rate swaps mature in june the million deferred gain will be amortized against the interest expense on the underlying debt through the maturity date of the original interest rate swaps in june we use a sensitivity analysis to measure the impact on fair values for interest rate swaps of an immediate adverse movement in the interest rates of basis points 
this analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a basis point change in interest rates 
this adverse change in the applicable interest rates would result in a decrease of million in the net fair value of our interest rate swaps at december  at december  we had unhedged variable rate debt of million 
using sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of a adverse movement in the interest rate  or basis points  would result in an increase to interest expense of million annually 
critical accounting estimates we prepare the consolidated financial statements of fmc technologies in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  our management re evaluates these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements 
percentage of completion method of accounting we record revenue on construction type manufacturing and assembly projects using the percentage of completion method  where revenue is recorded as work progresses on each contract 
there are several acceptable methods of measuring progress toward completion 
most frequently  we use the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs to measure this progress  however  there are also types of contracts where we consistently apply the ratio of units delivered to date or units of work performed as a percentage of total units because we have determined that these methods provide a more accurate measure of progress toward completion 
we execute contracts with our customers that clearly describe the equipment  systems and or services that we will provide and the amount of consideration we will receive 
after analyzing the drawings and specifications of the contract requirements  our project engineers estimate total contract costs based on their experience with similar projects and then adjust these estimates for specific risks associated with each project  such as technical risks associated with a new design 
costs associated with specific risks are estimated by assessing the probability that conditions will arise that will affect our total cost to complete the project 
after work on a project begins  assumptions that form the basis for our calculation of total project cost are examined on a monthly basis and our estimates are updated to reflect new information as it becomes available 
revenue recorded using the percentage of completion method amounted to  million   million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
a significant portion of our total revenue recorded under the percentage of completion method relates to the energy production systems business segment  primarily for subsea petroleum exploration equipment projects that involve the design  engineering  manufacturing and assembly of complex  customer specific systems 
the systems are not built from standard bills of material and typically require extended periods of time to construct 
total estimated contract cost affects both the revenue recognized in a period as well as the reported profit or loss on a project 
the determination of profit or loss on a contract requires consideration of contract revenue  change orders and claims  less costs incurred to date and costs to complete 
anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in full in the period in which they are identified 
profits are recorded based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete 
the total estimated contract cost in percentage of completion accounting is a critical accounting estimate because it can materially affect revenue and cost of sales  and it requires us to make judgments about matters that are uncertain 
there are many factors  including but not limited to resource price inflation  labor availability  productivity and weather that can affect the accuracy of our cost estimates and ultimately our future profitability 
in the past  we have incurred losses as a result of unforeseen changes in our project costs  including in our sonatrach contract 

table of contents the amount of revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method is sensitive to our changes in estimates of total contract costs 
if we had used a different estimate of total contract costs for each contract in progress at december  a increase or decrease in the estimated margin earned on each contract would have increased or decreased total revenue and pre tax income for the year ended december  by million 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  we evaluate each component of inventory on a regular basis to determine whether it is excess or obsolete 
we record the decline in the carrying value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense included in cost of sales in the period it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
in order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory  we begin by preparing a candidate listing of the components of inventory that have not demonstrated usage within the most recent two year period 
this list is then reviewed with sales  production and materials management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory items is accurate 
management considers as part of this evaluation whether there has been a change in the market for finished goods  whether there will be future demand for on hand inventory items and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete technology 
our estimate of excess or obsolete inventory is sensitive to changes in our assumptions about future sales 
had we assumed that future sales would be higher or lower than those used in our forecast  the effect on our estimate of excess or obsolete inventory and pre tax income for the year ended december   would have been an increase or decrease of million  on a current cost basis 
accounting for income taxes in determining our current income tax provision  we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments performance  our backlog  planned timing of new product launches  and customer sales commitments 
significant changes in the expected realizability of the deferred tax asset would require that we provide an additional valuation allowance against the gross value of our total deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction of net income 
as of december   we estimated that it is not likely that we will generate future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we have cumulative net operating losses and  therefore  we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets 
as of december   we estimated that it is more likely than not that we will have future taxable income in the united states to utilize our domestic deferred tax assets 
therefore  we have not provided a valuation allowance against any domestic deferred tax assets 
the need for a valuation allowance is sensitive to changes in our estimate of future taxable income 
if our estimate of future taxable income was lower than the estimate used  we would still generate sufficient taxable income to utilize such deferred tax assets 
retirement benefits we provide most of our employees with certain retirement pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits 
in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  management must make a variety of estimates  including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs  rate of compensation increase  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
we 
table of contents update these estimates on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 
these accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty attached to the estimate as well as the fact that these estimates are difficult to measure 
different estimates used by management could result in our recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
we use third party specialists to assist management in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measuring the costs and obligations associated with these retirement benefits 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets are based primarily on investment yields available and the historical performance of our plan assets 
they are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management s judgment and can materially affect net income 
pension expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the discount rate used affects the periodic recognition of the interest cost component of net periodic pension cost 
the discount rate is based on rates at which the pension benefit obligation could effectively be settled on a present value basis 
to determine the weighted average discount rate  we review long term  high quality corporate bonds at our determination date and use a model that matches the projected benefit payments for our plans to coupons and maturities from high quality bonds 
significant changes in the discount rate  such as those caused by changes in the yield curve  the mix of bonds available in the market  the duration of selected bonds  and the timing of expected benefit payments may result in volatility in pension expense and minimum pension liabilities 
we reduced the discount rate for our domestic and certain of our international plans during the weighted average discount rate declined from to in  after decreasing in from in our pension expense is sensitive to changes in our estimate of discount rate 
holding other assumptions constant  for a basis point reduction in the discount rate  annual pension expense would increase by approximately million before taxes 
holding other assumptions constant  for a basis point increase in the discount rate  annual pension expense would decrease by approximately million before taxes 
net periodic pension cost includes an underlying expected long term rate of asset return 
our estimate of the expected rate of return on plan assets is based primarily on the historical performance of plan assets  current market conditions  our asset allocation and long term growth expectations 
our actual returns on plan assets on trailing year and trailing year bases have exceeded the estimated long term rate of return of 
our actual returns on plan assets were and in and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets is recognized as part of the net periodic pension cost 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is amortized over the expected remaining service life of employees  so there is a lag time between the market s performance and its impact on plan results 
our pension expense is sensitive to changes in our estimate of expected rate of return on plan assets 
holding other assumptions constant  an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by approximately million before taxes
