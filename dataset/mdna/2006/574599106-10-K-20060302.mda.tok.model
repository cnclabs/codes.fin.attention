the financial and business analysis below provides information which the company believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion and certain other sections of this report contain statements reflecting the company s views about its future performance and constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of these views involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and  accordingly  the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
readers should consider that various factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors of this report  the executive level overview  critical accounting policies and estimates and outlook for the company sections  may affect the company s performance 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
executive level overview the company manufactures and installs home improvement and building products 
these products are sold to the home improvement and home construction markets through mass merchandisers  hardware stores  home centers  builders  distributors and other outlets for consumers and contractors 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the levels of home improvement and residential construction activity principally in north america and europe including repair and remodeling and new construction  the importance of and the company s relationships with key customers including the home depot  which represented approximately percent of the company s sales in  the company s ability to maintain its leadership positions in its markets in the face of increasing global competition  the company s ability to effectively manage its overall cost structure and the availability and cost of raw materials 
the company s international business faces political  monetary  economic and other risks that vary from country to country  as well as fluctuations in european currency exchange rates 
further  the company has financial commitments and investments in financial assets that are not readily marketable and that involve financial risk 
in addition  product liability claims and other litigation could be costly 
these factors are discussed in more detail in item a risk factors of this report 
historically  the company has largely offset the impact on its revenues of cyclical declines in the new construction and home improvement markets through new product introductions  acquisitions and market share gains 
while acquisitions have enabled the company to build the critical mass that has given the company strong positions in the markets it serves  the company has put less emphasis on growth through acquisitions to focus on organic sales growth 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables the company recognizes revenue as title to products and risk of loss is transferred to customers or when services are rendered 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing and co operative advertising arrangements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value with expense estimates made for obsolescence or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the recorded cost of inventories and their estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on an on going basis  the company monitors these estimates and records adjustments for differences between estimates and actual experience 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using these estimates 
financial investments the company maintains investments in marketable securities  which aggregated million  and a number of private equity funds  which aggregated million  at december  the investments in private equity funds are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period  or when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist  using information made available by the fund managers and other assumptions 
the investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value  and unrealized gains and unrealized losses that are deemed to be temporary are recorded as a component of shareholders equity  net of tax effect  in other comprehensive income 
the company records an impairment charge to earnings when an investment has experienced a decline in value that is deemed to be other than temporary 
future changes in market conditions  the performance of underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
based on its review  in the third quarter of  the company recognized an impairment charge of million related to its investment in four million shares of furniture brands international nyse fbn common stock to reduce the cost basis from per share to the market value at september  of per share 
in  the company also recognized an impairment charge of million related to the company s investment in fbn 
at december   the fbn common stock was in an unrealized gain position  the aggregate carrying value of the investment was million 
the fbn common stock  included in marketable securities  was received in june from the company s investment in furnishings international inc debt 
the company s investments in private equity funds and other private investments are carried at cost and are evaluated for impairment at each reporting period  or when circumstances  including the maturity of the fund  indicate impairment may exist 
since there is no active trading market for these investments  they are for the most part illiquid 
these investments  by their nature  can also have a relatively higher degree of business risk  including financial leverage  than other financial investments 
future changes in market conditions  the future performance of the underlying investments or new information provided by private equity fund managers could affect the recorded values of such investments and the amounts realized upon liquidation 
based on the company s review of its private equity funds  the company considered the decline in the estimated market value of certain of its private equity fund investments to be other than temporary and  accordingly  recognized an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of at december   the carrying value of the company s investments in private equity funds exceeded the estimated market value  as determined by the fund managers  by approximately million  which the company considers to be a temporary decline in the estimated fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company records the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net tangible assets of acquired companies as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  in the fourth quarter of each year  or as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  the company completes the impairment testing of goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow method 
determining market values using a discounted cash flow method requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
the company s judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends  consultations with external valuation specialists and other information 
while the company believes that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome 
in estimating future cash flows  the company relies on internally generated five year forecasts for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures  and generally a one to three percent long term assumed annual growth rate of cash flows for periods after the five year forecast 
the company generally develops these forecasts based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches  estimated housing starts and repair and remodeling estimates for existing homes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company estimated that future discounted cash flows projected for most of its reporting units were greater than the carrying values 
any increases in estimated discounted cash flows would have no impact on the reported value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company measures the possible goodwill impairment loss based on an allocation of the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any previously unrecognized intangible assets 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit s recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
this test for indicated that goodwill related to certain european businesses was impaired 
the company recognized a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million million  after tax in the fourth quarter of the company reviews its individual indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the assets may be impaired without regard to the reporting unit 
the company considers the implications of both external eg  market growth  competition and local economic conditions and internal eg  product sales  profit margins and expected product growth factors and their potential impact on cash flows related to the intangible asset in both the near and long term 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives 
the company evaluates the remaining useful lives of amortizable identifiable intangible assets at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
employee retirement plans accounting for defined benefit pension plans involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided in the future  based on vested years of service  and attributing those costs over the time period each employee works 
pension costs and obligations of the company are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions regarding inflation  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  compensation increases and discount rates for obligations 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
the company selects these assumptions with assistance from outside advisors such as consul tants  lawyers and actuaries 
changes in assumptions used could result in changes to the related pension costs and obligations within the company s consolidated financial statements in any given period 
in  the company decreased its discount rate for obligations to an average of percent from percent 
the discount rate for obligations was based on the expected duration of each defined benefit pension plan s liabilities matched to the december  citigroup pension discount curve 
such rates for the company s defined benefit pension plans ranged from percent to percent  with the most significant portion of the liabilities having a discount rate for obligations of percent or higher 
the assumed asset return was primarily percent  reflecting the expected long term return on plan assets 
the company s underfunded amount  or the difference between the projected benefit obligation and plan assets  increased to million from million in  primarily due to asset returns below projections 
qualified domestic pension plan assets in had a net gain of approximately four percent compared with average returns of five percent for the largest  plan benchmark 
the company s projected benefit obligation relating to the unfunded non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans was million at december  compared with million at december  the company expects pension expense for its qualified defined benefit pension plans to increase by million in compared with if the company assumed that the future return on plan assets was one half percent lower than the assumed asset return  the pension expense would increase by an additional million 
stock options and awards the company s long term stock incentive plan the plan replaced the long term stock incentive plan the plan in may and provides for the issuance of stock based incentives in various forms 
at december   outstanding stock based incentives were in the form of restricted long term stock awards  stock appreciation rights  phantom stock awards and stock options 
additionally  the company s non employee directors stock plan the plan provides for the payment of part of the compensation to non employee directors in company common stock 
restricted long term stock awards long term stock awards are granted to key employees and non employee directors of the company and do not cause net share dilution as the company continues the practice of reacquiring an equal number of shares on the open market 
the unvested stock awards  aggregating million million common shares at december  are included as a reduction in shareholders equity and are being expensed based on the respective vesting periods  principally years 
compensation expense for the annual vesting of long term stock awards was million for the year ended december  stock options fixed price stock options are granted to key employees and non employee directors of the company 
the grant date exercise price equals the market price of company common stock on the date of grant 
these options generally become exercisable in installments beginning on the first anniversary from the date of grant and expire no later than years after the grant date 
restoration stock options under the plan become exercisable six months from the date of grant 
the plan does not permit the granting of restoration stock options  except for restoration options resulting from the options granted under the plan 
the company began using the fair value method of accounting for options granted  modified or settled subsequent to january   and options granted prior to january  continue to be accounted for using the intrinsic value method as of december  effective january   the company will adopt sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective application mpa method 
sfas no 
r requires companies to measure and recognize the cost fair value of employee services received in exchange for stock options 
the mpa method will require the company to record expense for unvested stock options that were awarded prior to january  through the remaining vesting periods 
the expense for unvested stock options at january  will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
changes to the grant date fair value of stock options granted before january  are prohibited 
the mpa method does not require the restatement of prior year information 
the amount of expense related to total unvested stock options remaining at december  was million  such options have a weighted average vesting period of over years 
the fair value of stock options was estimated at the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions for risk free interest rate  dividend yield  volatility factor and expected option life years 
for sfas no 
r calculation purposes  the weighted average grant date fair value of option shares  including restoration options  granted in was per option share 
the fair value for each option grant is calculated and the related expense is recorded over the vesting period of the option grant 
if the company increased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in would increase percent 
if the company decreased its assumptions for the risk free interest rate and the volatility factor by percent  the expense related to the fair value of stock options granted in would decrease percent 
income taxes the company has considered potential sources of future foreign taxable income in assessing the need for establishing a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  and  related to its after tax foreign tax credit carryforward of million 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such determination is made 
other commitments and contingencies certain of the company s products and product finishes and services are covered by a warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one year to the life of the product 
at the time of sale  the company accrues a warranty liability for estimated costs to provide products  parts or services to repair or replace products in satisfaction of warranty obligations 
the company s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent that the company experiences any changes in warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims  its warranty liability is adjusted accordingly 
the company is subject to lawsuits and pending or asserted claims including income taxes with respect to matters generally arising in the ordinary course of business 
liabilities and costs associated with these matters require estimates and judgments based on the professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
when estimates of the company s exposure for lawsuits and pending or asserted claims meet the criteria for recognition under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to the company may differ due to subsequent developments

the derivative contracts are with two major creditworthy institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
the interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges  and the interest rate differential on interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the agreement 
for fair value hedge transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item hedged are recognized in determining earnings
