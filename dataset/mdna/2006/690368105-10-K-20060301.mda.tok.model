item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is one of the largest independent bulk shipping companies in the world 
the company s operating fleet consists of vessels aggregating million dwt  including three vessels that have been chartered in under capital leases  and vessels that have been chartered in under operating leases 
in addition to its operating fleet of vessels  charters in for ten us flag product carriers are scheduled to commence upon delivery of the vessels between and and charters in for four international flag product carriers are scheduled to commence upon delivery of the vessels between and four lng carriers are scheduled to be delivered in late and early to a joint venture in which the company has a interest  bringing the total operating and newbuild fleet to vessels 
acquisition of stelmar shipping ltd 
on january   the company acquired stelmar shipping ltd 
stelmar  a leading provider of petroleum product and crude oil transportation services 
the operating results of stelmar have been included in the company s financial statements commencing january  holders of stelmar s common stock received per share in cash for an aggregate consideration of approximately million 
taking into account the assumption of stelmar s outstanding debt  the total purchase price was approximately billion 
the company funded the acquisition of stelmar and the refinancing of its debt with million of borrowings under new credit facilities and million of cash and borrowings under long term credit facilities in existence as of december  stelmar s vessel fleet consisted of handysize  panamax and three aframax tankers 
stelmar s fleet included two chartered in aframax and nine chartered in handysize vessels 
sale of seven tankers to double hull tankers in october  osg sold seven tankers three vlccs and four aframaxes to double hull tankers  inc dht in connection with dht s initial public offering 
in consideration  osg received  in cash and  shares in dht  representing a equity stake in the new tanker concern 
the total consideration to osg values the transaction at  in november  the company sold  shares of dht pursuant to the exercise of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters of dht s initial public offering  and received net cash proceeds of  such sale reduced the company s interest in dht to 
osg time chartered the vessels back from dht for initial periods of five to six and one half years with various renewal options up to an additional five to eight years  depending on the vessel 
the charters provide for the payment of additional hire  on a quarterly basis  by the company when the aggregate revenue earned  or deemed earned  by these vessels for the company exceeds the sum of the basic hire paid during the quarter by the company 
under related agreements  a subsidiary of the company technically manages these vessels for dht for amounts that have been fixed except for vessel insurance premiums over the term of the agreements 
such agreements are cancelable by dht upon days notice 
osg recorded a deferred gain on the sale and charter back of these vessels of  in the fourth quarter of the gain was deferred for accounting purposes and will be recognized as a reduction of time charter hire expense over the initial charter periods 
the cash proceeds from the sale were used to reduce debt and for general corporate purposes 
the sale of the vessels underscores osg s strategy of actively managing the balance between owned and chartered in vessels in its fleet 
the transaction helped osg achieve its stated goal of returning to leverage ratios and liquidity levels that existed prior to the early acquisition of stelmar 
operations the company s revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by the company and the trades in which those vessels operate 
rates for the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products from which the company earns a substantial majority of its revenue are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for oil  the distance that cargoes must be transported  and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported 
the demand for oil shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy and level of opec s exports 
the number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service  principally because of scrapping 
the company s revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot voyage charter and long term time charter 
because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters  the company manages its vessels based on time charter equivalent tce revenues 
management makes economic decisions based on anticipated tce rates and evaluates financial performance based on tce rates achieved 
overview similar to  the year was characterized by significant volatility in shipping markets 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico changed shipping trade flows and caused bottlenecks  while collisions  groundings and the weather caused shipping delays in the bosporus straits and the dardanelles 
the ongoing insurgency in iraq reduced oil production and pipeline shipments to the mediterranean and caused loading delays in the arabian gulf 
civil unrest in nigeria continued to hamper oil production and exports  while tension between venezuela and the us increased 
world oil demand grew by a relatively modest  or million barrels per day b d  in the lower growth rate in resulted primarily from growth slowdowns in the us and china 
in the us  the slower growth was caused by the effects of the hurricanes during the last half of the year while high oil prices and the inability of refiners in china to recover these costs in the marketplace restrained chinese demand 
after record growth in  a year in which oil demand increased by million b d  further increases in demand during put additional pressure on the oil infrastructure 
middle east opec supplied most of the incremental barrels as net increases in non opec crude oil production were immaterial 
this caused a significant reduction in opec s spare producing capacity 
at the same time worldwide refining capacity was also constrained 
both developments were positive for shipping  as they increased tonne mile demand for both crude oil and petroleum products 
as a result  although tanker rates in were highly volatile  they remained well above historical averages despite a significant increase in the world tanker fleet 
the supply of new vessels entering the marketplace in  however  exerted downward pressure on rates 
the world tanker fleet increased to million dwt at the end of the year  higher than the million dwt at the beginning of a significant number of new tankers were delivered throughout the year  while vessel removals were limited 
continued high earnings and a generally favorable market outlook reduced the scrapping of older  single hull tonnage that had been predicted to occur by the april  imo deadline 
extreme weather had a significant impact on the tanker market in in particular  two major hurricanes in the gulf of mexico disrupted crude oil production  refinery operations and shipping logistics in the third and fourth quarters of the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita will continue to be felt well into the hurricanes affected both the crude oil and refined product markets 
during october  over one million b d  or of crude oil production in the gulf of mexico  was disrupted 
additional volumes of west african crude oil were transported to the us to replace lost gulf of mexico production 
incremental deliveries of west african crude oil are expected to continue until gulf of mexico production is fully restored 
initially  the direct impact on crude oil movements as a result of the lost production in the gulf of mexico was limited because the significant damage to us gulf coast refineries reduced crude oil demand 
at one point over four million b d of refining capacity was affected 
the refining downtime in the us resulted in counter seasonal declines in crude oil imports into the largest oil consuming nation in the world but necessitated additional product imports to the us the hurricanes also impacted seaborne trades outside the us as well  enhancing overall tonne mile demand 
the tables below show the daily tce rates that prevailed in markets in which the company s vessels operated for the periods indicated 
it is important to note that the spot market is quoted in worldscale rates 
the conversion of worldscale rates to the following tce rates required the company to make certain assumptions as to brokerage commissions  port time  port costs  speed and fuel consumption  all of which will vary in actual usage 
in each case  the rates may differ from the actual tce rates achieved by the company in the period indicated because of the timing and length of the voyages and the portion of revenue generated from long term charters 
international flag vlccs spot market tce rates vlccs in the arabian gulf q q q q average high low rates for vlccs trading out of the arabian gulf in averaged  per day  a decline of from the average but higher than the average 
the average is still one of the best annual average rates in the history of the tanker industry 
fleet expansion in excess of oil demand growth exerted downward pressure on vlcc rates throughout the year 
the impact of lower oil demand growth on the vlcc market was moderated because almost all the incremental crude oil was sourced from long haul opec producers 
opec crude oil production increased by  b d to million b d  the highest level since freight rates in the first quarter of declined from the extraordinary levels of the previous quarter  reflecting the slowing growth rate in world oil demand  particularly in china 
china s demand growth in the first quarter of was only  a significant decline from the unsustainable growth rate in the same period of the drop in apparent chinese demand reflects a large discrepancy between higher international oil prices and lower government controlled domestic prices  resulting in lower refining throughput and product imports as the higher international prices could not be recovered in the domestic market 
a mild winter in the northern hemisphere  which lowered heating oil requirements  also moderated growth in oil demand 
in the second quarter of  the vlcc market in particular was negatively affected by lower seasonal demand and a shift in trade flows 
a decline in iraqi exports most of which move westward combined with field maintenance in other middle eastern producers and extended refinery downtime in the us contributed to a reduction in long haul voyages from the arabian gulf 
rates picked up in the third quarter  benefiting from the typical seasonal increase in global oil demand met by increased production in a number of middle east opec countries returning from second quarter field maintenance 
rates increased toward the end of the quarter  spurred by the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  which had an impact on crude oil and refined product trade flows worldwide 
lower rates relative to the comparable year ago quarter were largely a result of significantly lower demand growth in china 
in the aftermath of the hurricanes that struck the us gulf coast  rates rose to their highest level in the fourth quarter 
additional volumes of long haul crudes were processed in europe and in the pacific basin for export to the us to compensate for the refining downtime caused by the hurricanes  which reduced domestic product availability 
the arrival of much colder temperatures in japan and korea in november stimulated increased consumption of kerosene used for heating 
this came on top of a dry spell in the fall  which caused a sharp decline in japan s hydroelectric power output 
the combined result was a near doubling of oil consumption by japan s electric power generating plants in november relative to the year ago period 
a drop off in rates in december  in part  reflected the anticipation of larger than usual us refinery maintenance scheduled for the first quarter of the world vlcc fleet expanded to vessels million dwt at december  from vessels million dwt at the beginning of the year as newbuilding deliveries well exceeded the number of vessels deleted from the fleet 
in  a total of newbuilding orders were placed million dwt 
this is a reduction compared with vessels  million dwt and vessels  million dwt 
the declining trend in orders was caused by high contract prices and long delivery lead times due to heavy ordering in other bulk shipping sectors 
as of december   the vlcc orderbook totaled vessels million dwt  equivalent to of the existing vlcc fleet  based on deadweight tons 
international flag aframaxes spot market tce rates aframaxes in the caribbean q q q q average high low rates for aframaxes operating in the caribbean during averaged  per day  a decrease of from the average but above the average 
rates in were adversely impacted by declines in north sea crude oil production of  b d  as well as stagnating production in venezuela  two key aframax loading areas 
production in the former soviet union fsu  which has become an increasingly important source of aframax employment in recent years  rose by in to million b d 
similarly to vlccs  fleet expansion in excess of oil demand growth exerted downward pressure on aframax rates throughout the year 
the decline in rates that began in the fourth quarter of steepened in the first quarter of resulting in an average rates declining from the first quarter of the decrease in rates reflects a substantial reduction in weather delays in the bosporus straits in the first quarter of relative to the comparable quarter when sustained delays for tankers reduced the availability of suitable tonnage in the mediterranean 
average rates in the second quarter of were slightly higher than in the year ago period  due  at least in part  to increased lightering activity in the us gulf  a collision between two tankers in the dardanelles and a vessel grounding in the bosporus 
additionally fsu seaborne exports increased during the quarter as shippers accelerated their second quarter liftings to avoid a significant increase in crude oil export duties effective on june rates in the third quarter of declined relative to the third quarter of as production declined in the north sea and latin america  and pipeline maintenance limited crude oil exports at the black sea port of novorossiysk 
aframax rates rose in the fourth quarter  with long transit delays in the bosporus a key supporting factor 
although fsu oil production increased to million b d  higher than the million b d produced in the fourth quarter of  fsu crude seaborne exports were lower for the same period 
this continued the slide that started late in the second quarter of  when crude oil export duties were raised 
the world aframax fleet expanded significantly to vessels million dwt as of december  from vessels million dwt at december   as vessel deliveries far outweighed scrap sales 
rising newbuilding prices further slowed the pace of aframax ordering to vessels million dwt in from vessels million dwt in and the record level of vessels million dwt in the aframax orderbook contracted to vessels million dwt at december   equivalent to of the existing aframax fleet  based on deadweight tons 
international flag panamaxes spot market tce rates panamaxes crude and residual oils q q q q panamax average panamax high panamax low rates for panamaxes averaged  per day  lower than the average in but above the average 
in  fuel oil demand in the us was largely driven by high natural gas prices that resulted in end users seeking lower cost alternatives to meet their energy requirements 
the increase in fuel oil demand boosted the requirements for panamaxes in the caribbean  particularly for double hull tonnage  given the more stringent imo regulations and a preference by the oil majors 
rates in the first quarter of for panamaxes transporting crude and residual oils were less than the corresponding quarter in  but still close to historic highs 
largely because of the strong incentive to substitute fuel oil for natural gas  us crude and residual fuel oil imports increased sharply over the comparable year ago period 
strong fuel oil demand in europe in the first quarter precluded transatlantic arbitrage trades  increasing us energy users dependence on fuel oil supplies from the caribbean 
a increase in the size of the panamax fleet  however  constrained rates 
in the second quarter of  average rates were higher than in the second quarter of  bolstered by continued robust fuel oil imports relative to year ago levels as utilities substituted fuel oil imports for high priced natural gas 
the large freight premium paid for double hull relative to single hull panamaxes operating in the atlantic basin resulted in the migration of some single hull vessels to the intra asian trade  reducing availability of suitable tonnage 
despite the large number of newbuilding deliveries and a drop off in production in latin america  average freight rates in the third quarter were comparable to the third quarter of substitution demand for fuel oil over natural gas remained strong  especially following the steep increase in the price of natural gas during the summer and in the aftermath of the us gulf hurricanes 
panamax rates were also supported as some vessel owners moved their vessels from the crude and residual fuel oil trade to the clean products trade  which benefited from the disruptions caused by the hurricanes 
natural gas attained its highest average price for the year in the fourth quarter of  which encouraged further substitution of fuel oil for natural gas by power utilities 
this contributed to another substantial increase in us fuel oil imports  which increased from the third quarter and more than from the fourth quarter of consequently  average freight rates increased above the third quarter but remained somewhat below the exceptionally high levels achieved in the fourth quarter of a sharp decline in natural gas prices starting in mid december coupled with a firming trend in oil prices could be expected to reverse some of the fuel substitution  negatively impacting panamax rates 
the world panamax product carrier fleet at december  increased to vessels million dwt from vessels million dwt as of december  the orderbook for panamax tankers remains significant 
at december   vessels million dwt  equivalent to of the existing panamax fleet  based on deadweight tons  were on order 
international flag handysize product carriers spot market tce rates handysize product carriers in the caribbean q q q q handysize average handysize high handysize low rates for handysize product carriers operating in the caribbean averaged  per day in  lower than the average but above the average 
freight rates in the first quarter of were less than the corresponding quarter in as continued fleet expansion exerted downward pressure on rates  despite a increase in refined product imports into the us quality tonnage trading in the caribbean benefited from backhaul movements of distillates to europe as refinery turnarounds and much colder temperatures increased demand for imported distillates 
in the seasonally weak second quarter  high gasoline prices in the us provided an arbitrage opportunity  resulting in higher gasoline imports relative to the first quarter as well as to the comparable year ago period 
at the same time  europe continued to source part of its distillate requirements from the caribbean  benefiting handysize product carrier employment 
these developments supported rates for handysize product carriers  which were slightly above the average rates in the corresponding quarter of after hurricanes katrina and rita knocked out significant refining capacity along the us gulf coast  oil companies and traders sought to secure tonnage to deliver additional volumes of refined products gasoline  diesel  and jet fuel from europe  asia and the caribbean to the us as a result  freight rates for handysize product carriers reached their highest level of the year towards the end of the third quarter of average fourth quarter rates exceeded the prior quarter as refined product imports into the us increased 
rates in the fourth quarter were lower than last year s fourth quarter rates  reflecting  in part  inventory levels in oecd countries that were either at or above the five year averages 
the world handysize fleet showed little change in  expanding to vessels million dwt at december  from vessels million dwt at december  at december   the newbuilding orderbook for handysize product carriers reached vessels million dwt  equivalent to of the existing handysize fleet  based on deadweight tons 
us flag jones act product carriers rates in the us coastwise trades that equate to osg s existing jones act handysize product carriers averaged  in  higher than the rate in robust demand for gasoline blended components on the us east and west coasts  hurricane related dislocations and a decline in the number of available vessels as a result of opa regulations contributed to the strength in rates 
the us coastwise trade in products in the fourth quarter of continued to be impacted by the hurricane related dislocations that significantly reduced refining capacity along the us gulf coast 
the jones act  which limits the carriage of shipments in coastwise trades to qualifying us flag vessels  was temporarily waived from september through september and again from september to october this permitted international flag tankers to transport oil between us ports ostensibly to ensure sufficient supplies of petroleum products 
the effect of the temporary waivers on the market was limited 
the total jones act product carrier fleet consisted of vessels million dwt as of december  approximately of this fleet is not double hull and will be phased out over the next ten years as a result of opa regulations 
additional scrapping of some of the remaining vessels could also occur prior to based on the age profile of these vessels 
outlook the international energy agency forecasts global oil demand to rise by to million b d in from million b d in this is a higher growth rate than the increase in relative to while the demand growth for is primarily expected to occur in the us and china  production growth is expected to come predominantly from non opec sources such as west africa and the fsu 
the projected increases in demand and the location of incremental production in is expected to increase tonne mile demand in on the refined product side  increases in worldwide demand are forecast to exceed increases in refining capacity in this is expected to result in additional product movements 
the world tanker fleet in is projected to increase by compared with a growth in and a increase in  as the sizable number of newbuilding deliveries is expected to be only partially offset by rising deletions  many of which are mandated under imo phase out regulations 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates in the application of its accounting policies based on the best assumptions  judgments  and opinions of management 
following is a discussion of the accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and the methods of their application 
for a description of all of the company s material accounting policies  see note a to the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item revenue recognition the company generates a majority of its revenue from voyage charters 
within the shipping industry  there are two methods used to account for voyage charter revenue and expenses ratably over the estimated length of each voyage and completed voyage 
the recognition of voyage revenues and expenses ratably over the estimated length of each voyage is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenues and expenses and the method used by osg 
under each method  voyages may be calculated on either a load to load or discharge to discharge basis 
in applying its revenue recognition method  management believes that the discharge to discharge basis of calculating voyages more accurately estimates voyage results than the load to load basis 
since  at the time of discharge  management generally knows the next load port and expected discharge port  the discharge to discharge calculation of voyage revenues and expenses can be estimated with a greater degree of accuracy 
osg does not begin recognizing voyage revenue until a charter has been agreed to by both the company and the customer  even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage 
vessel lives and impairment the carrying value of each of the company s vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of years from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard 
in the shipping industry  use of a year life has become the standard 
the actual life of a vessel may be different 
the company has evaluated the impact of the revisions to marpol regulation g that became effective april  and the new eu regulations that went into force on october  on the economic lives assigned to the tankers in the company s international flag fleet 
because the osg international flag tanker fleet comprises mainly modern  double hull vessels  the revised regulations will not require any double sided international flag tankers to be removed from service prior to attaining years of age 
the revised imo regulation g allows the flag state to permit the continued operation of the company s double sided tankers beyond because such regulations do not explicitly permit double sided tankers to continue trading beyond  their operation beyond is not assured 
osg considered the need to reduce the estimated remaining useful lives of its double sided international flag tankers because of the eu regulations and the revised and accelerated phase out schedule agreed to by imo in december these new regulations will not prevent any of these vessels from trading prior to reaching years of age 
accordingly  it was not deemed necessary to reduce the estimated remaining useful lives of any of osg s double sided international flag tankers 
if the economic lives assigned to the tankers prove to be too long because of new regulations or other future events  higher depreciation expense and impairment losses could result in future periods related to a reduction in the useful lives of any affected vessels 
the carrying values of the company s vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings 
historically  both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical 
the company records impairment losses only when events occur that cause the company to believe that future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value 
the carrying amounts of vessels held and used by the company are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular vessel may not be fully recoverable 
in such instances  an impairment charge would be recognized if the estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition is less than the vessel s carrying amount 
this assessment is made at the individual vessel level since separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available 
in developing estimates of future cash flows  the company must make assumptions about future charter rates  ship operating expenses  and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels 
these assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
osg performed an impairment test for its single hull and double sided international flag tankers  including vessels held in joint ventures  in december  because of the new eu regulations that became effective in october and the revised and accelerated phase out schedule agreed to by the imo in december for purposes of this analysis  the company assumed that the single hull tankers would stop trading in and the double sided tankers would continue trading until age  in accordance with the revised and accelerated phase out schedule adopted by the imo 
osg also assumed that these vessels would achieve lower tce rates than comparable double hull tankers over their remaining useful lives 
because voyage charter rates are volatile and vessel values vary over time  a probability weighted approach based on historically observed tce rates was used to estimate future cash flows 
in all cases  the carrying values of the company s single hull and double sided international flag tankers as of december  were less than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows for the respective vessels 
accordingly  no impairment loss was recorded 
there have been no impairment indicators since market value of marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  the company s holdings in marketable securities are classified as available for sale and  therefore  are carried on the balance sheet at fair value determined using period end sales prices on us or foreign stock exchanges with changes in carrying value being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the investments are sold 
accordingly  these changes in value are not reflected in the company s statements of operations 
if  however  the company determines that a material decline in fair value below the company s cost basis is other than temporary  the company records a noncash impairment loss in the statement of operations in the period in which that determination is made 
as a matter of policy  the company evaluates all material declines in fair value for impairment whenever the fair value of a stock has been below its cost basis for six consecutive months 
in the period in which a material decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of that security is written down to its fair value at the end of such period  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
based on a number of factors  including the magnitude of the drop in market values below the company s cost bases and the length of time that the declines had been sustained  management concluded that the declines in fair value of securities with aggregate cost bases of  in were other than temporary 
accordingly  the company recorded pre tax impairment losses of  in related to such securities 
these impairment losses are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the capital construction fund held a diversified portfolio of marketable equity securities with an aggregate cost basis of  and an aggregate fair value of  the gross unrealized losses on equity securities held in the capital construction fund as of december  were  none of the securities with unrealized losses as of december  had a fair value that had been materially below its carrying value for more than six months 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item for additional information on other pre tax unrealized losses as of december  drydocking within the shipping industry  there are three methods that are used to account for drydockings capitalize drydocking costs as incurred deferral method and amortize such costs over the period to the next scheduled drydocking  accrue the estimated cost of the next scheduled drydocking over the period preceding such drydocking  and expense drydocking costs as incurred 
since drydocking cycles typically extend over two and a half years or longer  management believes that the deferral method provides a better matching of revenues and expenses than the expense as incurred method 
the company further believes that the deferral method is preferable to the accrual method because estimates of drydocking costs can differ greatly from actual costs and  in fact  anticipated drydockings may not be performed if management decides to dispose of the vessels before their scheduled drydock dates 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowance the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is based on the assumption that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to permit the company to take deductions and use tax credit carryforwards 
during  the company recorded a valuation allowance of  related to capital losses arising from the write down of certain marketable securities 
the valuation allowance was established because the company believed that a portion of the capital losses might expire unused because the generation of future taxable capital gains was not certain 
during and  the company reduced the valuation allowance by  and  respectively  reflecting capital gains recognized in and increases in the fair value of securities previously written down and the effect of securities sold in the valuation allowance had been reduced to zero as of december  each quarter  management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
any increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets will result in additional income tax expense in the company s statement of operations 
pension benefits the company has recorded pension benefit costs based on complex valuations developed by its actuarial consultants 
these valuations are based on key estimates and assumptions  including those related to the discount rates used and the rates expected to be earned on investments of plan assets 
osg is required to consider market conditions in selecting a discount rate that is representative of the rates of return currently available on high quality fixed income investments 
a higher discount rate would result in a lower benefit obligation and a lower rate would result in a higher benefit obligation 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is management s best estimate of expected returns 
a decrease in the expected rate of return will increase net periodic benefit costs and an increase in the expected rate of return will decrease benefit costs 
with respect to the company s domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan  as of december   management reduced the discount rate to from following a reduction to from as of december  and maintained unchanged the expected rate of return on plan assets at 
in october  the company s board of directors approved the termination  effective december  of i the qualified defined benefit pension plan covering its domestic shore based employees  and ii the unfunded  nonqualified supplemental defined benefit pension plan covering certain active senior level employees 
accordingly  the selection of a discount rate for the qualified defined benefit pension plan as of december   was based on the assumption that the remaining active participants will elect and receive lump sum distributions when all necessary approvals are obtained 
the company expects such final settlement to occur in late or early in determining the discount rate at december   management  therefore  deemed the use of a current rate applicable to lump sum distributions to be more appropriate than the use of a long term discount rate based on high quality fixed income investments 
concurrently  the company amended its existing k employee savings plan and adopted a supplemental nonqualified savings plan to provide for increased levels of employer contributions  or hypothetical contributions to the unqualified plan  commencing in certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries have pension plans that  in the aggregate  are not significant to the company s financial position 
special purpose entity spe in  the company facilitated the creation of an spe that purchased from and bareboat chartered back to the company five us flag crude tankers that the company in turn bareboat chartered to alaska tanker company for the transportation of alaskan crude oil for bp 
the purchase price of million was financed by a term loan from a commercial lender and a substantive equity capital investment by the owner of the spe 
the company did not guarantee the vessels residual values or guarantee the spe s debt 
on july   the company consolidated this spe in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin 
under the provisions of fin  the company is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the spe 
for additional information  see note b to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item income from vessel operations during  tce revenues increased by  or  to  from  in  principally because of a  day increase in revenue days  partially offset by decreases in average daily tce rates for vlccs and aframaxes in the spot market
