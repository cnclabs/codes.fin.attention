item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust  or reit  engaged in the ownership  acquisition  management and redevelopment of apartment properties 
our property operations are characterized by diversification of product  location and price point 
as of december   we owned or managed  apartment properties containing  units located in states  the district of columbia and puerto rico 
our primary sources of income and cash are rents associated with apartment leases 
the key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are funds from operations  or ffo  ffo less spending for capital replacements  or affo  same store property operating results  net operating income  net operating income less spending for capital replacements  or free cash flow  financial coverage ratios  and leverage as shown on our balance sheet 
these terms are defined and described in the sections captioned funds from operations and capital expenditures below 
the key macro economic factors and non financial indicators that affect our financial condition and operating performance are rates of job growth  single family and multifamily housing starts  and interest rates 
because our operating results depend primarily on income from our properties  the supply and demand for apartments influences our operating results 
additionally  the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our properties  the pace and price at which we redevelop  acquire and dispose of our apartment properties  and the volume and timing of fee transactions affect our operating results 
our cost of capital is affected by the conditions in the capital and credit markets and the terms that we negotiate for our equity and debt financings 
our focus in has been to increase revenue and implement cost management and productivity initiatives  which includes centralizing purchasing  restructuring business processes  using technology to increase efficiency and implementing structured monthly reporting to identify issues and improve effectiveness of spending 
we believe that our efforts are having their intended effect  are resulting in a positive trend in certain operating results and are the foundation for improved long term operating results 
these initiatives and others have also resulted in improved asset quality  and we will continue to seek opportunities to reinvest in our properties through capital expenditures and to manage our portfolio through property sales and acquisitions 
for  our focus will include the following continue to improve operations so that customer satisfaction and occupancy increase to bring improved profitability  upgrade the quality of our portfolio through portfolio management and redevelopment  increase efficiency through improved business processes and automation  improve balance sheet flexibility  minimize our cost of capital in the face of rising interest rates  and monetize a portion of the value inherent in our properties with increased entitlements 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the financial statements 
results of operations overview compared to we reported net income of million and net loss attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   decreases of million and million  respectively 
these decreases were principally due to the following items  all of which are discussed in further detail within this section a decrease in income from discontinued operations  primarily related to lower net gains on dispositions of real estate  a decrease in net gain on disposition of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other  primarily related to a gain on sale of land  
table of contents an increase in depreciation and amortization expense  an increase in interest expense  and an increase in general and administrative expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in net operating income associated with property operations  which included increases related to acquisition  newly consolidated and same store properties 
compared to we reported net income of million and net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and net income attributable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december   increases of million and million  respectively 
these increases were principally due to the following items  all of which are discussed in further detail within this section an increase in net gain on disposition of real estate including the gain recognized in discontinued operations and the gain related to unconsolidated entities and other  and an increase in activity fees and asset management revenues 
these increases were partially offset by an overall decline in net operating income  which included a decline in same store net operating results  partially offset by increases related to acquisition and newly consolidated properties  an increase in general and administrative expenses  an increase in interest expense  and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
the following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of our operations in more detail 
rental property operations our operating income is primarily generated from the operations of our consolidated properties 
the principal components within our total consolidated property operations are consolidated same store properties  which consist of all conventional properties that were owned and not classified as held for sale and managed by us  stabilized and consolidated for all comparable periods presented  and other consolidated entities  which primarily include acquisition  newly consolidated  affordable and redevelopment properties 
the following table summarizes the overall performance of our consolidated properties for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  rental and other property revenues property operating expenses net operating income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   net operating income for our consolidated property operations increased by million  or 
this increase was principally due to a million increase in consolidated same store net operating income see further discussion of same store results under the heading conventional same store property operating results  a million increase related to operations of acquisition properties  which were principally comprised of palazzo east at park la brea and five other properties purchased in and the palazzo at park la brea and other properties purchased in  an million increase related to operations of newly consolidated properties  which are properties that had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method 
table of contents properties first consolidated in and properties first consolidated in  which includes properties that were consolidated due to the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin  a million increase related to operations of our affordable properties  and a million increase related to the completion of certain redevelopment properties 
these increases were offset by million of increased property management expenses and million of higher net casualty losses in as compared to  primarily relating to greater hurricane and tropical storm damage that occurred in for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income for our consolidated property operations decreased by million  or 
this decrease was principally due to a million decrease in consolidated same store net operating income see further discussion of same store results under the heading conventional same store property operating results 
additionally  there was a million decrease related to net casualty losses and other costs primarily resulting from hurricanes and tropical storms in the third quarter of  which damaged over of our properties and million in higher property management expenses 
these decreases were offset by an million increase related to operations of newly consolidated properties  which are properties that had been previously unconsolidated and accounted for by the equity method properties first consolidated in and properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of and a million increase related to operations of acquisition properties  which were principally comprised of the palazzo at park la brea and other properties purchased in  and three properties purchased in conventional same store property operating results same store operating results is a key indicator we use to assess the performance of our property operations and to understand the period over period operations of a consistent portfolio of properties 
we define same store properties as conventional properties i that we manage  ii in which our ownership interest exceeds  iii the operations of which have been stabilized for all periods presented and iv that have not been classified as held for sale 
our share reflects aimco s ownership share before minority interest in the aimco operating partnership 
to ensure comparability  the information for all periods shown is based on our ownership in the most current period presented in each table 
the following tables summarize the conventional rental property operations on a same store basis which is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap and reconcile them to consolidated rental property operations which is in accordance with gaap described in the above comparative discussions dollars in thousands year ended december  change our share of same store revenues less our share of same store expenses our share of same store net operating income adjustments to reconcile same store net operating income to real estate segment net operating income real estate segment net operating income same store statistics properties apartment units average physical occupancy average rent unit month includes i minority partners share of consolidated  less our share of unconsolidated  property revenues and property operating expenses at ownership  ii property revenues and property operating expenses related to consolidated properties other than same store properties eg  affordable  acquisition and

for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   our share of same store net operating income increased million  or 
revenues increased million  or  primarily due to higher occupancy up  higher average rent up per unit and lower bad debt 
expenses increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase of million in compensation expense related to increased staffing levels to support our initiatives to improve customer service  a million increase in utilities due primarily to higher natural gas rates  a million increase in real estate taxes  and million of increases primarily related to turnover expenses associated with our efforts to increase occupancy

for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   our share of same store net operating income decreased million  or 
revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to lower occupancy down  offset by higher utility reimbursements from residents and lower bad debt expense 
expenses increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and benefit expense related to a new employee health plan  merit increases and increased staffing levels  an increase of million in utilities due to the increase in the cost of natural gas  and an increase of million in marketing and administrative expenses associated with our efforts to increase occupancy 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in property taxes related to successful appeals and changes in estimates related to assessments 
property management we earn income from property management primarily from certain unconsolidated real estate partnerships for which we are the general partner 
the income is primarily in the form of fees generated through property management and other associated activities 
reported revenue from property management decreases as we consolidate real estate partnerships because it is eliminated in consolidation 
we expect this trend to continue as we increase our ownership in more of these partnerships or otherwise determine that consolidation is required by gaap 
additionally  our revenue decreases as properties within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships are sold 
offsetting the revenue earned in property management are the direct expenses associated with property management 

table of contents the following table summarizes the overall performance of our property management business for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  property management revenues  primarily from affiliates property management expenses net operating income from property management for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income from property management decreased by million  or 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income from property management decreased by million  or 
in both periods the decreases were principally due to an increase in the number of consolidated real estate partnerships resulting from increased ownership and gaap consolidation requirements  which required elimination of fee income and associated property operating expense related to such partnerships and the sales of properties within our unconsolidated partnerships properties in  properties in and properties in that had previously generated property management revenues 
activity fees and asset management activity fees are generated from transactional activity including tax credit syndications and redevelopments  dispositions  and refinancings 
these transactions occur on varying timetables  thus the income varies from period to period 
the majority of these fees are earned in connection with transactions related to affordable properties within the aimco capital portfolio 
we have a large number of affiliated real estate partnerships for which we have identified a pipeline of transactional opportunities 
as a result  we view activity fees as a predictable part of our core business strategy 
asset management revenue is from the financial management of partnerships  rather than management of day to day property operations 
asset management revenue includes deferred asset management fees that are recognized once a transaction or improvement in operations has occurred thereby generating available cash 
activity and asset management expenses are the direct expenses associated with transactional activities and asset management 
the following table summarizes the operating results of our transactional and asset management activities for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  activity fees and asset management revenues  primarily from affiliates activity and asset management expenses net operating income from activity fees and asset management included in the activity fees and asset management revenues  primarily from affiliates for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively  of fees related to affordable properties within the aimco capital portfolio 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased million  or 
this overall increase was principally a result of increased activity fees related to syndication and developer activities of million and million  respectively  as well as a million decrease in expenses associated with these activities 
additionally  we received million in promote distributions from an unconsolidated partnership  as a result of us  as general partner  achieving financial returns to the limited partners in excess of established targets 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in asset management fees and decreases of million and million in activity fees related to disposition and refinancing activities  respectively 

table of contents for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   net operating income from activity fees and asset management increased by million  or 
this overall increase was principally a result of increased activity fees related to disposition  refinancing and developer activities of million  million and million  respectively  due to a greater number of transactions in than in additionally  there was an increase of million related to the recognition of deferred asset management fees resulting from closed transactions and improved operations 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in syndication fees and million in higher expenses associated with these activities 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   depreciation and amortization increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million of additional depreciation on certain real estate assets where the depreciation was adjusted prospectively see impairment of long lived assets in note of the consolidated financial statements in item  million and million of additional depreciation related to newly consolidated and acquisition properties  respectively  and million from the completion of certain redevelopment properties 
additionally  million of the increase was due to a change in estimated useful lives that apply to capitalized payroll and certain indirect costs see capital expenditures and related depreciation in note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   depreciation and amortization increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million of additional depreciation related to the newly consolidated and acquisition properties  respectively  as well as million from the completion of certain redevelopment properties 
additionally  million of the increase resulted from additional depreciation on certain real estate assets where the depreciation was adjusted prospectively see impairment of long lived assets in note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million in higher compensation related to increased staffing levels  increased health care costs  and transition costs associated with the chief financial and chief accounting officer positions 
additionally  at the end of there was million in severance costs related to the restructuring of regional operating centers as a result of property dispositions 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   general and administrative expenses increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million in higher compensation related to increased staffing levels  merit increases and variable compensation  million related to increased health insurance costs and the effect of a favorable change in related to our accrual for insurance claims incurred but not reported ibnr  million in increased amortization of restricted stock and stock option compensation  and million in legal costs and compliance costs primarily related to the internal control reporting requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of other expenses income  net other expenses income  net includes income tax provision benefit  franchise taxes  risk management activities related to our unconsolidated partnerships and partnership expenses 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   other expenses income  net changed million from expense of million in to income of million in this change was principally due to an million higher income tax benefit recognized in as compared to  reflecting increased losses of our taxable reit subsidiaries see further discussion in note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
in the year ended december   there was a tax benefit of million recorded  as compared to million in the year ended december  additionally  we had higher income associated with our risk management activities  primarily due to better workers compensation 
table of contents claim experience as a result of more focused loss prevention measures 
these increases in other income were partially offset by million of higher partnership expenses primarily related to increases in professional fees 
for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   other expenses income  net changed million from income of million in to expense of million in this change was principally due to a million lower income tax benefit recognized in as compared to  due primarily to an million benefit related to the reversal of a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in see further discussion in note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
in the year ended december   there was a tax benefit of million recorded  as compared to million in the year ended december  interest income interest income consists primarily of interest and accretion on general partner notes receivable from our unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
transactions that result in accretion occur on varying timetables and thus the income generated may vary from period to period 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest income decreased million  or 
this decrease was principally a result of million in lower accretion income  partially offset by higher interest income from money market and interest bearing accounts due to increased interest rates and higher cash balances 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   interest income increased million  or 
this increase was principally a result of million in higher interest due from general partner notes receivable  and million in higher accretion income 
interest expense for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million and million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to acquisition and newly consolidated properties  respectively  million due to increased borrowings and increased interest rates on corporate and variable rate property debt and other items 
these increases were partially offset by million in lower amortization of loan costs  primarily due to corporate debt restructuring in  million in higher capitalized interest due to increased redevelopment activity  and a million decrease related to the redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in and early for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   interest expense increased million  or 
this increase was principally due to million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to the newly consolidated properties  million resulting from interest on the additional debt related to acquisition properties  and a million decrease in capitalized interest due to redevelopment properties being placed in service 
additionally  an million increase related to the credit facility and term loan of which million was associated with the write off of deferred loan costs related to the november modification of the credit facility and term loan and million related to the payoff of the indebtedness incurred to complete the acquisition of casden properties  inc due to higher average principal balances along with a higher weighted average interest rate 
the november modification reduced the spread over libor by an average of  which has favorably impacted interest expense related to our revolving credit facility and million term loan 
these increases were partially offset by lower weighted average effective interest rates on mortgage debt due to refinancings that occurred in and deficit distributions to minority partners when real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions to partners in excess of the carrying amount of the minority interest  we record a charge equal to the amount of such distribution  even though there is no economic effect or cost 

table of contents for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   deficit distributions to minority partners decreased million  or 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   deficit distributions to minority partners decreased million  or 
the decrease in both periods was due to reduced levels of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity and decreased operating results  as well as our increased ownership of such partnerships 
gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other includes our share of gain related to dispositions of real estate within our unconsolidated real estate partnerships  gain on dispositions of land and other non depreciable assets and costs related to asset disposal activities 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other decreased million 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other increased million 
the change in both periods was principally due to a million gain on the sale of a parcel of land located in florida and a million gain from the sale of one of our unconsolidated core properties  both of which occurred in changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period 
additionally  gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction  and are not comparable period to period 
minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects minority partners share of operating results of consolidated real estate partnerships 
this includes the minority partners share of property management fees  interest on notes and other amounts eliminated in consolidation that we charge to such partnerships 
for the years ended december   and  such minority interests had a favorable effect on our consolidated operating results 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the benefit from minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships decreased million 
for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   the benefit from minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships increased million 
the change in both periods was driven by property operating results 
during as compared to our property operating results improved  thereby reducing the benefit from minority interest 
when comparing to our property operating results declined  thereby increasing the benefit from minority interest 
income from discontinued operations  net for properties accounted for as held for sale  the results of operations for properties sold during the period or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are generally required to be classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for further policy information 
the property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include all property related revenues and operating expenses  depreciation expense recognized prior to the classification as held for sale  property specific interest expense to the extent there is secured debt on the property and the associated minority interest 
in addition  any impairment losses on assets held for sale  and the net gain on the eventual disposal of properties held for sale are reported as discontinued operations 
for the years ended december    and  income from discontinued operations  net totaled million  million and million  respectively  which includes a loss from operations of million in and income from operations of million and million in and  respectively 
in  the income from operations included the operating results of properties and one 
table of contents partnership that were sold or classified as held for sale during in and  the income from operations included the operating results of properties and one partnership and properties and one partnership  respectively  that were sold or classified as held for sale in  and due to varying number of properties and the timing of sales  the income from operations is not comparable year to year 
during  we sold properties and one partnership  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately million which is net of million of related income taxes 
additionally  we recognized million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in and million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners 
during  we sold properties  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately million which is net of million of related income taxes 
additionally  we recognized million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in and million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners 
during  we sold properties  resulting in a net gain on sale of approximately million which is net of million of related taxes 
additionally  we recognized million in impairment losses on assets sold or held for sale in and million of net recoveries of deficit distributions to minority partners 
changes in the level of gains recognized from period to period reflect the changing level of our disposition activity from period to period 
additionally  gains on properties sold are determined on an individual property basis or in the aggregate for a group of properties that are sold in a single transaction  and are not comparable period to period 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for more details on discontinued operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on march   we recorded a million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle related to the adoption of fin this charge is attributable to our recognition of cumulative losses allocable to minority interest that would otherwise have resulted in minority interest deficits 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for further information 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets real estate and other long lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization  unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable  we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows  excluding interest charges  of the property 
if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments 
these factors include the general economic climate  competition from other apartment communities and other housing options  local conditions  such as loss of jobs or an increase in the supply of apartments  that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates  changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance  increases in operating costs including real estate taxes due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset by increased rents  
table of contents changes in tax laws and housing laws  including the enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing  changes in market capitalization rates  and the relative illiquidity of such investments 
any adverse changes in these and other factors could cause an impairment in our long lived assets  including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
based on periodic tests of recoverability of long lived assets  for the year ended december   we recorded impairment losses of million related to properties to be held and used 
for the years ended december  and  we determined that the carrying amount for our properties to be held and used was recoverable and  therefore  we did not record any impairment losses related to such properties 
notes receivable and interest income recognition notes receivable from unconsolidated real estate partnerships consist primarily of notes receivable from partnerships in which we are the general partner 
the ultimate repayment of these notes is subject to a number of variables  including the performance and value of the underlying real estate property and the claims of unaffiliated mortgage lenders 
our notes receivable include loans extended by us that we carry at the face amount plus accrued interest  which we refer to as par value notes  and loans extended by predecessors whose positions we generally acquired at a discount  which we refer to as discounted notes 
we record interest income on par value notes as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements 
we discontinue the accrual of interest on such notes when the notes are impaired  as discussed below  or when there is otherwise significant uncertainty as to the collection of interest 
we record income on such nonaccrual loans using the cost recovery method  under which we apply cash receipts first to the recorded amount of the loan  thereafter  any additional receipts are recognized as income 
we recognize interest income on discounted notes receivable based upon whether the amount and timing of collections are both probable and reasonably estimable 
we consider collections to be probable and reasonably estimable when the borrower has entered into certain closed or pending transactions which include real estate sales  refinancings  foreclosures and rights offerings that provide a reliable source of repayment 
in such instances  we recognize accretion income  on a prospective basis using the effective interest method over the estimated remaining term of the loans  equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value 
we record income on all other discounted notes using the cost recovery method 
for the year ended december   if we had not been able to complete certain transactions  our accretion income would have been lower by million 
accretion income recognized in any given period is based on our ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes  therefore  accretion income varies on a period by period basis and could be lower or higher than in prior periods 
allowance for losses on notes receivable we assess the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis  which assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note 
we recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership s real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment 
in certain instances where other sources of cash flow are available to repay the loan  the impairment is measured by discounting the estimated cash flows at the loan s original effective interest rate 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million in net recovery of impairment losses on notes receivable 
during the year ended december   we identified and recorded million in net impairment losses on notes receivable 
we will continue to evaluate the collectibility 
table of contents of these notes  and we will adjust related allowances in the future due to changes in market conditions and other factors 
capitalized costs we capitalize costs  including certain indirect costs  incurred in connection with our capital expenditure activities  including redevelopment and construction projects  other tangible property improvements  and replacements of existing property components 
included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning  execution and control of all capital expenditure activities at the property level 
we characterize as indirect costs an allocation of certain department costs  including payroll  at the regional operating center and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital expenditure activities 
we capitalize interest  property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopment and construction projects are in progress 
costs incurred in connection with capital expenditure activities are capitalized where the costs of the improvements or replacements exceed we charge to expense as incurred costs that do not relate to capital expenditure activities  including ordinary repairs  maintenance  resident turnover costs and general and administrative expenses 
see note capital expenditures and related depreciation of the consolidated financial statements in item for further policy information 
for the years ended december   and  for continuing and discontinued operations  we capitalized million  million and million of interest costs  respectively  and million  million and million of site payroll and indirect costs  respectively 
funds from operations funds from operations  or ffo  is a non gaap financial measure that we believe  when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with gaap  is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery  computers or other personal property 
the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we compute ffo for all periods presented in accordance with the guidance set forth by nareit s april  white paper  which we refer to as the white paper 
we calculate ffo diluted by subtracting redemption related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock and adding back dividends distributions on dilutive preferred securities and interest expense on dilutive mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
in addition  although ffo is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts  there can be no assurance that our basis for computing ffo is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts 

table of contents for the years ended december   and  our ffo is calculated as follows in thousands net income loss attributable to common stockholders adjustments depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization related to non real estate assets depreciation of rental property related to minority partners interest depreciation of rental property related to unconsolidated entities gain on dispositions of real estate related to unconsolidated entities and other gain on dispositions of non depreciable assets deficit distributions to minority partners cumulative effect of change in accounting principle discontinued operations gain on dispositions of real estate  net of minority partners interest depreciation of rental property  net of minority partners interest recovery of deficit distributions to minority partners  net income tax arising from disposals minority interest in aimco operating partnership s share of above adjustments preferred stock dividends redemption related preferred stock issuance costs funds from operations preferred stock dividends redemption related preferred stock issuance costs dividends distributions on dilutive preferred securities interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities funds from operations attributable to common stockholders diluted weighted average number of common shares  common share equivalents and dilutive preferred securities outstanding common shares and equivalents dilutive preferred securities total notes represents the numerator for earnings per common share  calculated in accordance with gaap 
includes amortization of management contracts where we are the general partner 
such management contracts were established in certain instances where we acquired a general partner interest in either a consolidated or an unconsolidated partnership 
because the recoverability of these management contracts depends primarily on the operations of the real estate owned by the limited partnerships  we believe it is 
table of contents consistent with the white paper to add back such amortization  as the white paper directs the add back of amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry 
minority partners interest  means minority interest in our consolidated real estate partnerships 
in accordance with gaap  deficit distributions to minority partners are charges recognized in our income statement when cash is distributed to a non controlling partner in a consolidated real estate partnership in excess of the positive balance in such partner s capital account  which is classified as minority interest on our balance sheet 
we record these charges for gaap purposes even though there is no economic effect or cost 
deficit distributions to minority partners occur when the fair value of the underlying real estate exceeds its depreciated net book value because the underlying real estate has appreciated or maintained its value 
as a result  the recognition of expense for deficit distributions to minority partners represents  in substance  either a our recognition of depreciation previously allocated to the non controlling partner or b a payment related to the non controlling partner s share of real estate appreciation 
based on white paper guidance that requires real estate depreciation and gains to be excluded from ffo  we add back deficit distributions and subtract related recoveries in our reconciliation of net income to ffo 
represents the denominator for earnings per common share diluted  calculated in accordance with gaap  plus additional common share equivalents that are dilutive for ffo 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management 
both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from our operations 
additional sources are proceeds from property sales and proceeds from refinancings of existing mortgage loans and borrowings under new mortgage loans 
our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities  payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt  capital expenditures  dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to partners  and acquisitions of  and investments in  properties 
we use our cash provided by operating activities to meet short term liquidity needs 
in the event that the cash provided by operating activities is not sufficient to cover our short term liquidity demands  we have additional means  such as short term borrowing availability and proceeds from property sales and refinancings  to help us meet our short term liquidity demands 
we use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as debt maturities and property acquisitions  through long term borrowings  both secured and unsecured  the issuance of debt or equity securities including op units  the sale of properties and cash generated from operations 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from december   which cash is principally from sales and refinancing transactions that has yet to be distributed or applied to the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
at december   we had million of restricted cash  primarily consisting of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds  capital expenditures  property taxes and insurance 
in addition  cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis 
the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in item operating activities for the year ended december   our net cash provided by operating activities of million was primarily from operating income from our consolidated properties  which is affected primarily by rental rates  occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of properties 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million compared with the year ended december   driven by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily due to cash used to 
table of contents reduce current liabilities related to interest and real estate tax accruals  offset by decreases in accounts receivable related to improved collections  and decreases in prepaid expense and restricted cash balances 
investing activities for the year ended december   our net cash used in investing activities of million primarily resulted from investments in our existing real estate assets through capital spending as well as the acquisition of palazzo east at park la brea and five other properties see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for further information on acquisitions  partially offset by proceeds received from sales of properties 
although we hold all of our properties for investment  we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment when compared to alternative uses for our capital 
during the year ended december   we sold consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties 
these properties were sold for an aggregate sales price of million  of which million related to the consolidated properties 
the sale of the consolidated properties generated proceeds totaling million  after the payment of transaction costs 
our share of the total net proceeds from the sale of the properties  after repayment of existing debt  payment of transaction costs and distributions to limited partners  was million  of which million related to the unconsolidated properties and was included in our distributions received from investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
sales proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding short term indebtedness and for other corporate purposes 
we are currently marketing for sale certain properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategy 
additionally  from time to time  we may market certain properties that are consistent with our long term investment strategy but offer attractive returns  such as sales to buyers who intend to convert the properties to condominiums 
gross sales proceeds from dispositions are expected to be million to million  and we plan to use our share of the net proceeds from such dispositions to reduce debt  fund capital expenditures on existing assets  fund property and partnership acquisitions  redeem preferred securities and for other operating needs and corporate purposes 
capital expenditures we classify all capital spending as capital replacements which we refer to as cr  capital improvements which we refer to as ci  casualties or redevelopment 
non redevelopment and non casualty capitalizable expenditures are apportioned between cr and ci based on the useful life of the capital item under consideration and the period we have owned the property ie  the portion that was consumed during our ownership of the item represents cr  the portion of the item that was consumed prior to our ownership represents ci 
for the year ended december   we spent a total of million on cr 
these are expenditures that represent the share of expenditures that are deemed to replace the consumed portion of acquired capital assets 
for the year ended december   we spent a total of million  million and million  respectively  on ci  casualties and redevelopment 
ci expenditures represent all non redevelopment and non casualty capital expenditures that are made to enhance the value  profitability or useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition 
casualty expenditures represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with casualty losses and are associated with the restoration of the asset 
a portion of the restoration costs may be reimbursed by insurance carriers subject to deductibles associated with each loss 
redevelopment expenditures represent expenditures that substantially upgrade the property 

table of contents the table below details our share of actual spending  on both consolidated and unconsolidated real estate partnerships  for cr  ci  casualties and redevelopment for the year ended december  on a per unit and total dollar basis based on approximately  ownership equivalent units excluding non managed units weighted for the portion of the period that we owned the property  and reconciles it to our consolidated statement of cash flows for the same period in thousands  except per unit amounts

during the year ended december   we closed five mortgage loans totaling million  with an initial weighted average interest rate of  to finance our consolidated acquisitions 
revolving credit facility and term loans we have an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions  which we refer to as the credit agreement 
on june   we amended our credit agreement  to provide for million in additional term loan borrowings 
the additional term loan matures on november  and bears interest at a rate of either libor plus or a base rate determined by reference to the federal funds rate or bank of america s prime rate plus 
the proceeds from the additional term loan were used to repay outstanding revolving loans 
the aggregate amount of commitments and loans under the credit agreement is million  comprised of million of revolving loan commitments and million in term loans 
the term loans mature on november  and the revolving loans mature on november  at december   the term loans had an outstanding principal balance of million and a weighted average interest rate of based on libor plus for the original million and libor plus for the additional million 
at december   the revolving loans had an outstanding principal balance of million and a weighted average interest rate of based on various weighted average libor and base rate borrowings outstanding with various maturities 
the amount available under the revolving credit facility at december  was million after giving effect to million outstanding for undrawn letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility

from time to time we may issue preferred securities in both public offerings and private placements to generate proceeds to be used to redeem higher cost preferred securities  to finance acquisitions of real estate interests and for other corporate purposes 

table of contents our board of directors has  from time to time authorized us to repurchase shares of our outstanding capital stock 
in april  our board of directors replaced the existing authorization with a new authorization to repurchase up to a total of eight million shares of our common stock 
these repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to applicable law 
during  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock 
contractual obligations this table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this annual report regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of december  amounts in thousands less than more than total one year years years years scheduled long term debt maturities secured credit facility and term loans long term liabilities related to assets held for sale redevelopment and other construction commitments leases for space occupied development fee payments total the development fee payments above were established in connection with the acquisition of casden properties  inc and our commitment as it relates to the casden development company  llc 
we agreed to pay million per quarter for five years up to an aggregate amount of million to casden development company  llc as a retainer on account for redevelopment services on our assets 
in addition  we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties 
those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures 
future capital needs in addition to the items set forth in contractual obligations above  we expect to fund any future acquisitions  additional redevelopment projects and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales including tax free exchange proceeds  short term borrowings  debt and equity financings and operating cash flows 
in  we plan to invest between and million in conventional redevelopment projects that will impact approximately properties with nearly  units 
additionally  in redevelopment expenditures on affordable properties will be approximately million  predominantly funded by third party tax credit equity  impacting to properties with more than  units 
off balance sheet arrangements we own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships  in which our total ownership interests range typically from less than up to 
however  based on the provisions of the relevant partnership agreements  we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes see note of the consolidated financial statements in item 
there are no lines of credit  side agreements  or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate partnerships and us and no material exposure to financial guarantees 
accordingly  our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes 
table of contents receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for additional information on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates 
we are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk  or any other material market rate or price risks 
we use predominantly long term  fixed rate non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings 
we use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities  property sales proceeds  long term debt or equity financings 
we had  million of floating rate debt outstanding at december  including debt classified within liabilities related to assets held for sale 
of the total floating rate debt  the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing million  floating rate secured notes million  revolving loans million  and term loans million 
historically  changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio of less than with changes in taxable interest rates 
floating rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the bma index  which since has averaged of day libor 
if this relationship continues  an increase in the day libor  of in tax exempt interest rates would result in our income before minority interests and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
this would be offset by variable rate interest income earned on certain assets  including cash and cash equivalents and notes receivable  as well as interest that is capitalized on a portion of this variable rate debt incurred in connection with our redevelopment activities 
considering these offsets  the same increase in the day libor would result in our income before minority interests being reduced by million on an annual basis 
comparatively  if the day libor had increased by in  our income before minority interests would have been reduced by million on an annual basis 
the potential reduction of income before minority interests was greater in as compared to primarily due to higher floating rate balances resulting from additional borrowings  primarily related to the additional million term loan  revolving loans and secured notes 
we believe that the fair value of our floating rate secured tax exempt bond debt and floating rate secured long term debt as of december  approximate their carrying values 
the fair value for our fixed rate debt agreements was estimated based on the market rate for debt with the same or similar terms 
the combined carrying amount of our fixed rate secured tax exempt bonds and fixed rate secured notes payable at december  was billion compared to the estimated fair value of billion see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
if market rates for our fixed rate debt were higher by  the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have decreased from billion to billion 
if market rates for our fixed rate debt were lower by  the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would have increased from billion to billion
