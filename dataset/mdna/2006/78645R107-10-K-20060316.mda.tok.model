eracom augmented our borderless security offering with the addition of its hardware security modules hsm designed for the electronic funds transfer eft  credit card and atm segments of the financial services market  and its poi products that encrypt data on pcs  laptops  servers  and portable media 
the results of operations of eracom technologies ag have been included in our consolidated results of operations beginning december  our historical operating results have been dependent on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the length of the sales cycle  the timing of orders from and shipments to clients  product development expenses and the timing of development and introduction of new products 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues 
the size and timing of our historical revenues have varied substantially from quarter to quarter and year to year 
accordingly  the results of a particular period  or period to period comparisons of recorded sales and profits may not be indicative of future operating results 
recent development on february   we announced that we had reached an agreement with the board of directors of ncipher plc  a company incorporated under the laws of england and wales ncipher  on the terms of a recommended cash offer for the entire issued and issuable upon exercise of options granted ordinary share capital of ncipher  for pence in cash for each ncipher share the offer and the offer price  respectively 
based on the offer price  the number of ncipher outstanding shares and the number of ncipher shares issuable upon exercise of options granted  the total consideration to be paid by us would be approximately million approximately us million 
ncipher provides hsm technology  disk encryption technology and other products for identity protection and management 
the directors of ncipher have unanimously recommended that ncipher shareholders accept the offer 
in addition  we have received irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from all of the directors of ncipher with respect to ncipher shares representing approximately of ncipher s outstanding ordinary share capital  irrevocable undertakings to accept the offer from certain institutional shareholders with respect to ncipher shares representing approximately of ncipher s outstanding ordinary share capital  which undertakings will become non binding if the offer lapses or is withdrawn or if an offer for ncipher shares is made by a third party at certain prices per ncipher share  and non binding letters in support of the offer from certain other institutional shareholders with respect to ncipher shares representing approximately of ncipher s outstanding ordinary share capital 
also  ncipher has agreed to pay a fee to safenet of  approximately us million if the offer is not consummated due to certain events 
the offer is subject to certain conditions  including the valid acceptances of not less than or such lesser percentage as we may decide of the ncipher shares to which the offer relates 
upon the offer becoming  or being declared  unconditional in all respects and sufficient acceptances being received  we intend to exercise our rights in accordance with the laws of the united kingdom to acquire the remaining ncipher shares not tendered in the offer 
we expect the acquisition to close in the second quarter of results of operations of safenet the following table sets forth certain of our consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december revenues cost of revenues gross profit research and development expenses sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses costs of integration of acquired companies write off of in process research and development restructuring charge amortization of intangibles amortization of deferred compensation total operating expenses operating income loss investment income and other expenses  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues and gross margins variance dollars in thousands revenues by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenues by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total revenue mix by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenue mix by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total gross margins by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total gross margins by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total includes amortization of acquired intangibles  in and  in and amortization of unearned compensation in  in 
revenues increased by million overall primarily due to million increase in product offerings and the inclusion of the full year results of operations for the acquired rainbow and datakey businesses 
the million increase in service and maintenance revenue is primarily the result of the acquisition of mediasentry and an increased level of service and maintenance contracts for new sales and renewals of existing service and maintenance contracts 
license and royalties increased million primarily as a result of increased sales of our licensed toolkit offerings 
the revenue increase by segment for the year ended december  over the year ended december  is attributable to several factors 
the embedded security division added million of revenue from increased product offerings from both internal development efforts and those acquired in business combinations during that were not available in revenues earned by the enterprise security division increased million  due primarily to increases in our type and borderless product offerings 
inclusion of a full year of results of operations for businesses acquired in also contributed to the increase 
the revenue mix by type has not changed significantly between and our integrated product and service offerings will continue to offer growth in all three revenue types  but we expect to remain a product based company 
these products include hardware  appliances  and product development 
the revenue mix by segment should continue to be materially consistent with the most recent year  with the embedded security division representing to of total revenues and the enterprise security division representing the remainder 
gross margins for each type of revenue fluctuated for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in product margin was due to the type products  which carry margins in the to range and represent approximately of the revenues for the current period 
the products and services comprising the remaining portion of the revenue base earn average margins from to over the gross margins by segment are reflective of changes within each division 
the embedded security division s gross margins increased because of the addition of higher margin products primarily through acquisitions 
the enterprise security division s gross margins decreased because of the increase in product revenues over other revenue streams as a result of a full year of results of operations of the acquired rainbow and datakey businesses coupled with growth in the mykotronx business 
product revenues are typically lower margin sales than service and maintenance  licenses  or royalties 
the enterprise security division has become primarily a product based business and thus experienced slight margin degradation based on the product sales mix 
the enterprise security division s gross margins will fluctuate based on the mix of revenues from sales of type products and other higher margin products during the applicable reporting period 
operating expenses variance dollars in thousands operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development costs cost of integration of acquired companies restructuring charge amortization of intangible assets amortization of unearned compensation total research and development expenses rose due to the increase in the number of ongoing technology projects within the company as well as the increase in the number of research and development team employees 
we have added personnel through acquisitions in the last to months  including rainbow and datakey in for  we added personnel from dmdsecure  mediasentry and eracom 
the number of research and development personnel increased to as of december  from as of december   representing an increase of approximately 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses have remained consistent at approximately for both and the company has been able to leverage its many research and development resources into multiple projects that have resulted in increased and continuously improving product offerings of both hardware and software 
sales and marketing expenses increased due to two factors 
the first factor is additional headcount added throughout the year  due primarily to the dmdsecure  mediasentry and eracom acquisitions 
the number of sales and marketing personnel increased to as of december  from as of december   representing an increase of approximately 
the second factor is increased sales  which incrementally increases selling costs  including commissions 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased from for to for the increase in the percentage of total revenue was expected as we have expanded into new markets throughout the world 
general and administrative expenses increased due to additional legal and professional fees  as well as increased headcount 
we expect to continue to incur certain professional costs associated with compliance with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  we will incur additional costs associated with adding additional staffing and technical expertise in our accounting and financial reporting functions  as discussed in more detail in item a of this form k 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were consistent at approximately for both and for write off of acquired in process research and development costs increased by approximately million 
the write off of acquired in process research and development costs was directly attributable to the acquisition of dmdsecure assets 
these write offs represent the estimated fair value of the in process research and development projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility at the acquisition date  and had no future alternate future use 
the value assigned to acquired in process technologies relate to the dmdmobile v project 
the estimated fair value of this project was determined by the use of a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate that took into account the stage of completion  and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of the technology and product 
there was no such write off in costs of integration of acquired companies decreased by approximately million from the year ended december  to the same period in the costs in primarily reflect the integration costs related to the acquisitions of dmdsecure and mediasentry in addition to the final amounts of integration costs related to the acquisitions of rainbow and datakey 
the acquisitions in were considerably less in size and scope than the acquisition of rainbow 
these costs will fluctuate as we acquire companies and integrate the people  systems  products and cultures into the combined company 
the fluctuation is dependent on the level of effort required in integrating the people  systems  products and cultures of any potential acquired business 
the restructuring charges for of approximately million primarily represent an estimated liability related to the exit of one of our leased facilities as well as significant reduction in the use of another facility 
we have been able to consolidate leased facilities as we continue to integrate the businesses we acquired in and amortization of intangible assets increased from million for to million for the amortization for the period includes a full year of amortization from the rainbow and datakey acquisitions completed in and the addition of partial years amortization for the dmdsecure  mediasentry and eracom acquisitions 
amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue to be a significant cost for and future periods 
amortization of unearned compensation is a cost primarily related to the rainbow and mediasentry acquisitions 
it reflects the amortization of the intrinsic value of the unvested portion of common stock options assumed by us in each of the acquisitions 
interest and other income  net variance dollars in thousands interest income  net foreign exchange gain loss  net other income total the increase in interest income is due primarily to increased cash and investment balances that increased interest earned over the prior period 
the gain in foreign exchange relates to increased volume of transactions of international sales and strengthening of the us dollar against the currencies of our international customers 
other income increased as a result of a realized gain on the sale of a building  offset by loss on disposals of other assets 
in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes that will mature on december  the notes bear interest at per annum  which will generate approximately million of interest expense in  which will be offset by the interest earned 
for the years ended december  and  interest expense of and  respectively  was incurred and has been included in interest income  net of interest expense 
income tax expense variance dollars in thousands income tax expense the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  is 
the overall effective rate was greater than the us statutory rate primarily due to an increase in our effective state tax rate related to deferred tax liabilities established in purchase accounting for non deductible intangible assets and net operating losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized  offset by tax benefits associated with operating in lower tax rate foreign countries 
in  the effective income tax rate was 
the difference between this rate and the us statutory rate was primarily due to the non deductible write off of in process research and development costs and net operating losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues and gross margins variance dollars in thousands revenues by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenues by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total revenue mix by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total revenue mix by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total gross margins by type license and royalties products service and maintenance total gross margins by segment embedded security division enterprise security division total includes amortization of acquired intangibles  in and  in and amortization of unearned compensation in  in 
revenues increased million primarily due to increased product offerings that stemmed from acquisitions  primarily the rainbow acquisition 
revenue from those product offerings accounted for million of the increased revenue  including the related service and maintenance revenue 
license and royalties decreased due to several one time sales in  specifically  the execution of six new license arrangements that accounted for million in revenue 
there were also million of new intellectual property licenses during these sales were not repeated in service and maintenance revenue increased due to several acquired maintenance contracts from the rainbow transaction 
revenue increases by segment for the year ended december  over the year ended december  are reflective of several factors 
the embedded security division added million of revenue from product offerings acquired in business combinations during that were not available in revenues earned by the enterprise security division increased million  due primarily to acquired product offerings million 
the revenue mix by type has changed significantly as our acquisitions were product based companies  particularly rainbow technologies with a product and service mix  historically 
our integrated product and service offerings will continue to offer growth in all three revenue types but we expect to remain a product based company 
these products include hardware  appliances  and customized products 
the revenue mix by segment should continue to be materially consistent with the most recent quarter  with the embedded security division representing to of total revenues and the enterprise security division representing the remainder 
gross margins for each type of revenue fluctuated for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the fluctuation in product margin was due to the secure communications business  which carries margins in the to range and represents over of the revenues for the current period 
the products and services comprising the remaining portion of the revenue base earn average margins from to over the gross margins by segment are reflective of changes within each division 
the embedded security division s gross margins as well as the enterprise security division s gross margins decreased because of the increase in product revenues over other revenue streams 
product revenues are much lower margin sales than service and maintenance  licenses  or royalties 
both divisions have become primarily product based businesses driving down margins 
the enterprise security division s gross margins will fluctuate based on the mix of revenues from sales of secure communications products during the applicable reporting period 
operating expenses variance dollars in thousands operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative write off of acquired in process research and development costs cost of integration of acquired companies restructuring charge amortization of intangible assets amortization of unearned compensation total research and development expenses rose due to the increase in the number of ongoing technology projects within the company as well as the increase in the number of research and development team employees 
we have added personnel through several acquisitions in the last to months  including cylink  raqia  ssh  rainbow and datakey 
for  we added personnel from cylink and raqia in february and ssh in november as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses have decreased from to 
we have been able to leverage our many research and development resources into multiple projects that have resulted in increased and continuously improving product offerings of both hardware and software 
sales and marketing expenses increased due to two factors 
the first factor is additional headcount added throughout the year  due primarily to the rainbow and datakey acquisitions 
the second factor is increased sales  which incrementally increases selling costs  including commissions 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased from for to for the decrease in the percentage of total revenue was expected as we continue to leverage our current product offerings and sales force to handle the additional demand and markets that we are moving into throughout the world 
general and administrative expenses increased due to additional legal and professional fees  as well as increased headcount 
there were costs incurred in associated with compliance with the provisions of sarbanes oxley 
we expect to continue to incur compliance related costs 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were for and for in  our acquisitions of cylink and the raqia assets necessitated the write off of in process research and development costs totaling million in the aggregate cylink million  raqia million 
there were no such charges in associated with the rainbow or datakey acquisitions 
costs of integration of acquired companies increased million from the year ended december  to the same period in the costs for the period reflect significant integration and professional fees related to the cylink acquisition 
the costs in reflect rainbow and datakey integration costs 
for the significant costs of integration were approximately million of personnel and related costs  related to the re branding of the combined company  and million of legal and professional fees 
the restructuring charges for of million for represents an estimated liability to vacate one of our leased facilities 
we have been able to consolidate leased facilities as we continue to integrate the businesses we acquired in and this restructuring charge may change during the remaining term of the lease as we update our estimates of likely sublease income 
amortization of intangible assets increased from million for to million for the same period in the amortization for the period includes amortization from multiple acquisitions including cylink  raqia  ssh and nine and a half months of amortization related to the rainbow acquisition as well as two and a half months of datakey 
for the same period in  amortization of intangible assets includes eleven months of amortization related to the cylink acquisition  ten months of amortization related to the raqia acquisition and two months related to the ssh acquisition 
there was no rainbow cost in this will continue to be a significant cost to the company for and future periods 
amortization of unearned compensation is a cost specific to the rainbow acquisition 
it reflects the amortization of the intrinsic value of the unvested portion of common stock options assumed by us in the rainbow acquisition 
we did not assume any unvested options during interest and other income  net variance dollars in thousands interest and other income  net the increase in interest and other income is due primarily to increased cash and investment balances that increased interest earned over the prior period 
income tax expense benefit variance dollars in thousands income tax expense benefit the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  is 
the overall effective rate was more than the us statutory rate primarily due to the impact of certain acquisition related costs that are not deductible for tax purposes  offset by the tax benefits associated with foreign subsidiaries operating in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
in  the effective income tax rate was 
the difference between this rate and the us statutory rate was primarily due to the non deductible write off of in process research and development costs and net operating losses in certain foreign subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million including cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our operating activities have provided cash to the business for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million 
the increase is largely attributable to a smaller increase in accounts receivable in than in growth in accounts receivable decreased cash by million in compared to only million in increases in accounts payable and non cash expenses also contributed to the decrease in cash 
cash provided by investing activities decreased million  primarily due to the purchase of available for sale securities of million and cash paid for dmdsecure  mediasentry and eracom of approximately million 
cash provided by financing activities increased by million  which can be attributed to the proceeds received from the issuance of million of the convertible subordinated notes discussed below  less million of financing costs  offset by the repurchase of company stock of million 
on december   the company completed the issuance and sale in a private placement of million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due december   generating net cash proceeds of approximately million after deducting fees  expenses and the initial purchaser s discounts 
interest on the notes is payable in cash semiannually beginning june  at a rate of per year 
the notes are unsecured and subordinated obligations that rank junior in right of payment to any future senior indebtedness 
upon conversion of each  principal amount of notes  a holder will receive  in lieu of common stock  an amount in cash equal to the lesser of  or the conversion value  determined in the manner set forth in the indenture for the notes 
if the conversion value exceeds  on the conversion date  we will also deliver  at our election  cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock with respect to the remaining common stock deliverable upon conversion 
in no event will the aggregate number of remaining shares of common stock to be issued upon conversion of any note exceed the aggregate share cap of shares per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment 
the initial conversion rate is shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  representing an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment upon specified events 
see note to the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k which more fully describes the terms of the debt issuance 
we used million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes to purchase approximately million shares of our outstanding common stock 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes and possibly for future acquisitions 
subsequent to december   we made a cash tender offer to acquire the entire ordinary share capital of ncipher plc for approximately million  or approximately million when reduced by the expected cash to be acquired in the acquisition should the deal be consummated 
see the discussion under the recent developments section of item the notes are expected to increase our interest expense for by approximately million  the impact of which reduced interest earned on the invested proceeds from the debt issuance and our invested cash of the company 
we believe that our current cash resources and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated short term and long term needs 
we have expended  and will continue to expend  significant amounts of cash for acquisition and integration costs related to prior and future acquisitions 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of integration costs related to acquisitions 
we expect to incur additional costs associated with the acquisitions 
these costs relate to professional fees such as legal  due diligence  professional integration advisory services and financial advisory fees and other non recurring costs of integrating acquired companies 
additionally  we would expect that there may be additional cash obligations resulting from future acquisitions that we may pursue 
future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations and commitments  as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based on the terms of the relevant agreements and appropriate classification of items under generally accepted accounting principles currently in effect 
future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts 
see forward looking statements 
less than more than total one year years years years in thousands convertible subordinated notes interest on convertible subordinated notes operating leases other obligations total the convertible subordinated notes are convertible prior to their stated maturity upon the occurrence of certain events beyond our control 
upon conversion  the principal is payable in cash 
the interest obligation on our long term debt assumes that our convertible notes will bear interest at their stated rates until maturity 
the operating leases are for the multiple facilities that we lease for our operations  sales and headquarters 
inflation and seasonality we do not believe that inflation will significantly impact our business 
we do not believe our business is seasonal 
however  because we generally recognize product revenues upon shipment and software revenues upon establishing fair value of undelivered elements  recognition may be irregular and uneven  thereby disparately impacting quarterly operating results and balance sheet comparisons 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
as discussed in this note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our senior management has discussed each of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we calculate the allowance based on a specific analysis of past due balances and also consider historical trends of write offs 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory and reserve for obsolescence we provide for our estimated inventory obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we utilize projected sales by product to determine the net realizable value of the inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we reserve for slow moving  excess  and obsolete inventory 
slow moving inventory is calculated based on product sales over a day period 
amounts on hand less the amount sold over the last days are generally reserved for 
in addition to slow moving reserves  we may record additional reserves on specific items or products 
software development costs we calculate amortization of our capitalized software development costs based on the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product including the period being reported on 
in addition  we assess the recoverability of software development costs by comparing the unamortized balance to the net realizable value of the asset and write off the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value 
these calculations require management to make assumptions about future demand for our products  future revenues to be generated from the sale of our products  as well as the estimated useful lives of developed technology 
if actual market conditions or product demand is different from those assumptions  or if changes in technology limit the useful life of our core technology  additional amortization or write downs may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting 
a portion of the purchase price for each of these businesses is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the dates of acquisitions 
any excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill 
the identified intangible assets include patents  developed technology  purchase orders  customer relationships  contract backlog and acquired in process research and development assets 
research and development assets are written off at the date of acquisition in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the fair values were determined by management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations prepared by independent valuation experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using risk adjusted discount rates 
for certain classes of intangible assets  the valuations have been based upon estimated cost of replacement 
the assigned useful lives  which range from one to ten years  are based upon periods of estimated cash flows and other factors 
if we used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the fair value of identified intangible assets and the estimation of the related useful lives  the amounts allocated to these assets  as well as the related amortization expense  could have been significantly different than the amounts recorded 
under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value using the impairment testing methodology in statement indicators of potential impairment include operating losses  loss of a significant customer and adverse industry developments 
impairment testing for goodwill is conducted annually 
our most recent test was conducted as of october  the goodwill impairment test under statement involves a two step approach 
under the first step  the company determines the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned 
the reporting units for purposes of the impairment test are our two operating segments  the embedded security division and the enterprise security division  as these are the components of the business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we then compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit by estimating the present value of the reporting unit s future cash flows  as well as by using comparable company multiples 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets of the reporting unit is considered potentially impaired and the second step is completed in order to measure the impairment loss 
under the second step  we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets  including any unrecognized intangible assets  of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step 
we then compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of each  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
the estimated fair values of the reporting units based on the discounted cash flow models and comparable company multiples for each business segment exceeded the carrying value of their recorded net assets  no impairment was identified or recorded 
however  if we would have used different assumptions and estimates in the calculation of the fair value of the reporting units  including different discount and growth rates  an impairment of goodwill may have been identified 
product warranties we offer warranties on our products ranging from ninety days to two years 
the specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our warranties and record a liability at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the estimated cost per claim 
we periodically assesses the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
while warranty costs have historically been within management s expectations  it is possible that warranty rates will change in the future based on new product introductions and other factors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from software and technology licenses  product sales  maintenance post contract customer support  and services 
software and technology licenses typically contain multiple elements  including the product license  maintenance  and or other services 
we allocate the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the fair value of each of the deliverables determined by vendor specific objective evidence license revenue is comprised of perpetual and time based license fees  which are derived from arrangements with end users  original equipment manufacturers and resellers 
for each license arrangement  we defer revenue recognition until a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery of the software or technology has occurred and there are no remaining obligations or substantive customer acceptance provisions  c the fee is fixed or determinable  and d collection of the fee is probable 
for both perpetual and time based licenses  once all of these conditions are satisfied  we recognize license revenue based on the residual method after all elements other than maintenance have been delivered as prescribed by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
royalties are recognized as they are earned 
we also sell hardware and related encryption products 
for each product sale  we defer revenue recognition until a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred and there are no remaining obligations or substantive customer acceptance provisions  c the selling price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and d collectibility of the selling price is reasonably assured 
for product arrangements that contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements using the residual method 
for arrangements containing multiple elements where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  we would defer revenue for the delivered and undelivered elements until vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists or all elements have been delivered 
revenues that are earned under long term contracts to develop high assurance encryption and other technology are recognized using contract accounting 
under contract accounting  revenue from these arrangements is typically recognized using the percentage of completion method 
progress to completion is measured using either contract milestones  costs incurred  or units of delivery 
accounting for these contracts requires the estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each contract 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
our service revenue is comprised primarily of revenue from consulting fees and training 
service revenue is recognized when the services are provided to the customer 
our policy is to recognize software license revenue when these associated services are not essential to the functionality of the product 
to date  these services have not been essential to the functionality of the products 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of these services is determined by reference to the price that a customer will be required to pay when the services are sold separately  which is based on the price history that we have developed for separate sales of these services 
income taxes we earn a significant portion of our income from subsidiaries located in countries outside of the united states 
at december   undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately million 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for these undistributed earnings because it is management s intention to permanently reinvest such undistributed earnings outside of the united states 
apb opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas  requires that a company evaluate its circumstances to determine whether or not there is sufficient evidence to support the assertion that it has or will reinvest undistributed foreign earnings indefinitely 
our assertion that earnings from its foreign operations will be permanently reinvested is supported by projected working capital and long term capital needs in each subsidiary location in which the earnings are generated 
additionally  we believe that we have the ability to permanently reinvest foreign earnings based on a review of projected cash flows from domestic operations  projected working capital and liquidity for both short term and long term domestic needs  and the expected availability of debt or equity markets to provide funds for those domestic needs 
if circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be remitted to the united states in the foreseeable future  we will be required to recognize deferred tax liabilities on those amounts 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of we net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made
