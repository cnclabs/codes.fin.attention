item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this can cause wide fluctuations in both our orders and net revenues and  depending on our ability to react quickly to these shifts in demand  can significantly impact our results of operations 
these industry cycles are difficult to predict 
because the industry cycles are generally characterized by sequential quart erly growth or declines in orders and net revenues throughout the cycle  year over year comparisons of operating results may not always be as meaningful as comparisons of periods at similar points in either up or down cycles 
in addition  during both downward and upward cycles in our industry  while the general trend over several quarters tends to be one of either growth or decline  in any given quarter  the trend in both our orders and net revenues can be erratic 
this can occur  for example  when orders are pulled in  pushed out or canceled by a significant customer or when customer forecasts and general business conditions fluctuate during a quarter 
net revenues and bookings the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a breakdown of the net revenues from unaffiliated customers both by product segment and geographic area based on the location of the selling entity 
years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers manipulator docking hardware temperature management tester interface intersegment sales intersegment sales manipulator docking hardware temperature management tester interface us europe asia pacific during the first half of  the ate industry entered a period of expansion that continued throughout the balance of that year and into the first half of however  late in the third quarter of  there was a significant weakening in the level of our orders in both our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface product segments as several customers of these two segments either postponed scheduled shipments or canceled orders 
this decline in demand continued throughout the balance of and into the first quarter of and eventually impacted our temperature management product segment as well 
while the trends in orders and net revenues have improved during  demand has not yet returned to the level we experienced in the third quarter of which we now believe to be the peak of the last up cycle in the ate industry 
the result is that our consolidated net revenues declined million or during as compared to the net revenues net of intersegment sa les of our manipulator docking hardware  temperature management and tester interface product segments declined  and during as compared to  respectively 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the larger percentage decline in the net revenues of our tester interface segment also reflects increased competition during this led to significant downward pressure on pricing and  in some cases  we chose not to bid on business rather than sell at prices where we would not be assured of positive margins 
instead  this segment focused on new product development areas during the smaller percentage decline in the sales of our temperature management segment also reflects the fact that these products are used in less cyclical non production environments  such as research and development laboratories  as well as in industries outside semiconductor test 
total orders for the year ended december  decreased to million on a consolidated basis as compared to million for the low point for our orders in the last eight quarters was the fourth quarter of where our orders totaled million 
during the first three quarters of  we experienced sequential growth in our orders with orders for the first  second and third quarters of totaling million  million and million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  our orders declined to million 
we had anticipated this decline as we attributed a portion of the increase in the third quarter to certain customers programs being accelerated  which resulted in demand being pulled into the third quarter of from the fourth quarter of backlog at december   our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was approximately million compared with approximately million at december  our backlog includes customer orders which we have accepted  substantially all of which we expect to deliver in while backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders  a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates 
our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on short lead times available from suppliers  including us  in periods of depressed demand 
in periods of increased demand  there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog 
as a result  our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
cost containment and organizational changes in response to the sudden downturn in the second half of  we began the process of restructuring our operations with the goal of significantly reducing our fixed operating costs to position ourselves to more effectively meet the needs and expectations of the cyclical ate market 
in november  we announced organizational changes and cost structure adjustments the workforce reduction that gave our divisional general managers increased responsibility for marketing  sales and service  thus allowing for the reduction of corresponding central corporate staff 
in march  we announced our intention to close our uk manufacturing operation the uk operation closure 
in late july  we made certain cost structure adjustments at our facility in san jose  california the california workforce reduction 
as a part of the workforce reduction  we eliminated four executive level positions  reduced approximately of our domestic personnel  and made certain salary and benefit adjustments 
during the fourth quarter of  we incurred severance costs of approximately  related to these actions 
the annualized cost benefit of these actions was estimated to be approximately million  including both permanent headcount reductions and salary and benefit adjustments  based upon our sales levels at the time of the restructuring 
during  we restored some of the salary reductions as sales levels increased in our temperature management segment and in our manipulator docking hardware segment and will restore an additional portion of the salary reductions during the second quarter of in our manipulator docking hardware segment 
the level of savings we will achieve in future periods will vary if we determine to restore additional portions of the salary and benefit adjustments or if we determine t hat we need to increase staffing to meet increasing demand 
as a part of the uk operation closure  we shut down our manufacturing facility and opened a branch office in the uk that will provide customer support to this region 
during  we incurred  in severance and related costs and  in lease termination costs related to these actions 
the  accrual remaining at december  relates primarily to lease termination costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our accrual for lease termination costs includes an estimate of future rental income from a sub lease arrangement 
at december   we had not sub leased this facility 
if we are unable intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to sublet this facility as planned  we may incur additional costs related to this facility in future periods 
we estimate that the closure of our uk manufacturing operation reduced our annual operating expense structure by approximately million  net of the costs associated with the branch office we have opened 
we began to see the benefit of these cost reductions during the third quarter of during the third quarter of  we reduced staff in our tester interface product segment located in san jose  california and incurred  in severance costs related to this action 
the annualized cost benefit of this action is estimated to be  we began to see the benefit of these cost reductions during the fourth quarter of we believe our recent reorganization and decentralization will make us a more competitive company and position us to adapt more quickly to new market challenges and opportunities through continued research and development as well as strategic merger and acquisition activities 
as part of our continuing focus to determine methods to increase our profitability worldwide while operating in the cyclical ate markets  we intend to continue reviewing and evaluating actions that could better match our operating costs against our anticipated future revenue and product demand as we pursue additional growth opportunities 
excess and obsolete inventory charges on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record charges for excess and obsolete inventory based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional excess and obsolete inventory charges are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the excess and obsolete inventory charges we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
we incurred charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the level of these charges was based upon a variety of factors including changes in demand for our products and new product designs 
the charges for included approximately  related to the remaining inventory located at our uk manufacturing operation which was closed as of june   as previously discussed 
the higher level of inventory obsolescence charges during was primarily the result of customer order cancellations after we had already purchased inventory to fulfill the orders and where that inventory could not be used in other products we manufacture due to its highly customized nature 
in addition  we had increases in our reserves for excess quantities related to materials that were purchased based upon forecasted orders which did not materialize 
during the fourth quarter of  management made the determination to curtail the practice of purchasing significant amounts of inventory against forecasted orders due to the increased level of uncertainty in our current business outlook 
however  in the future  we may determine that it is appropriate to increase the level of such purchases based on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  general market conditions and the specific delivery requirements of our customers 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
product warranty charges we accrue product warranty charges quarterly  based upon our historical claims experience 
in addition  from time to time  we accrue additional amounts based upon known product warranty issues  such as product retrofits 
for the years ended december   and  our product warranty charges were  million and million  or  and of net revenues  respectively 
the higher levels of product warranty charges in and were the result of specific product retrofits and other costs associated with several products we sold to three ate manufacturers 
there were no similar known product retrofit warranty issues for which we needed to record additional specific product warranty accruals in the level of our product warranty charges both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is affected by a number of factors including the cyclicality of demand in the ate industry  the prototype nature of much of our business  the complex nature of many of our products and  at our discretion  providing warranty repairs or replacements to customers after the contracted warranty period has expired in order to promote strong customer relations 
see also critical accounting policies 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued product customer mix our three product segments each have multiple products that we design  manufacture and sell to our customers 
the gross margin on each product we offer is impacted by a number of factors including the amount of intellectual property such as patents utilized in the product  the number of units ordered by the customer at one time  or the amount of intest designed and fabricated material included in our product compared with the amount of third party designed and fabricated material included in our product 
the weight of each of these factors  as well as the current market conditions  determines the ultimate sales price we can obtain for our products and the resulting gross margin 
the mix of products we sell in any period is ultimately determined by our customers needs 
therefore  the mix of products sold in any given period can change significantly from the prior period 
as a result  our consolidated gross margin can be significantly impacted in any given period by a change in the mix of products sold in that period 
we sell our products to both semiconductor manufacturers end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
for the years ended december   and  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues were  and  respectively 
the impact of an increase in oem sales as a percentage of net revenues is generally a reduction in our gross margin  as oem sales historically have had a more significant discount than end user sales 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales for these product segments  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we also expect to continue to experience demands from our oem customers supply line management groups to reduce our sales prices to them 
this continued price pressure may have the ultimate effect of reducing our gross and operating margins if we cannot further reduce our manufacturing and operating costs 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading or improving the utilization  performance and efficiency of existing ate  tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of temperature management systems results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in an electronic device handler 
in addition  in recent quarters we have begun to market our temperatur e management systems in industries outside semiconductor test  such as the automotive  aerospace  medical and telecommunications industries 
we believe that these industries usually are less cyclical than the ate industry 
risk factors please refer to item a risk factors for a discussion of other important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our prior results or those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
consequently  the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis for the company as a whole and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of each such business 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the principal items included in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total net revenues 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling expense engineering and product development expense general and administrative expense restructuring and other charges operating income loss other income earnings loss before income taxes income tax expense net earnings loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
we believe the decrease in our net revenues reflects the aforementioned weaker cyclical demand during as compared to most of as previously mentioned  we began to see a decline in demand late in the third quarter of for  the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our manipulator docking hardware  temperature management and tester interface segments decreased million or  million or and million or  respectively  over the comparable period in we believe the larger percentage decreases in our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments reflect the decreased production requirements of our customers during  and that the smaller percentage decrease in the sales of our temperature management segment reflects the fact that these products are used in less cyclical non production environments  such as research and development laboratories  as well as in industries outside of semiconductor test 
the larger percentage decline in the net revenues of our tester interface segment also reflects increased competition during this led to significant downward pressure on pricing and  in some cases  we chose not to bid on business rather than sell at prices where we would not be assured of positive margins 
instead  this segment focused on new product development areas during during  our net revenues from customers in the us and europe decreased and  respectively  and our net revenues from customers in asia increased over the comparable period in the smaller percentage decline for our european customers reflects the fact that sales of temperature management products represent a higher percentage of our total european sales than they do of our domestic sales  and  as previously discussed  sales of our temperature management products have not been as significantly impacted by the weakened demand in the industry 
in addition  the lower percentage decline in sales to european customers can also be attributed to the fact that the sales of our intestlogic operation in rosenheim  germany decreased only in as compared to we believe this reflects strong customer acceptance of the products manufactured by this subsidiary 
the increase for our customers in asia primarily reflects an increase in sales of third party products by our japanese subsidiary in as compared to gross margin 
gross margin was for as compared to for the decline in gross margin was primarily the result of our fixed operating costs not being as fully absorbed in due to the significantly lower net revenue levels as compared to as a percentage of net revenues  our fixed operating costs were and for and  respectively 
in absolute dollar terms  our fixed operating costs decreased million during as compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower salary and benefits expense as a result of the cost containment initiatives we put into place during late and early this decrease was partially offset by a reduction in the utilization rates of our internal machine shop operations in both our cherry hill  new jersey and our san jose  california facilities  as well as an increase in our insurance premiums 
our component material costs were for as compared to for the comparable period in we attribute the increase in component material costs primarily to product mix 
our excess and obsolete inventory charges totaled million  or of net revenues  for as compared to million  or of net revenues  for finally  although the absolute dollar value of direct labor decreased by  for as compared to  as a intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued percentage of net revenues  direct labor remained consistent at for both years due to the significantly lower net revenue levels in as compared to we attribute the decrease in the absolute dollar value of direct labor to the aforementioned cost containment initiatives 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to a million decrease in product warranty costs as well as lower levels of commission expense 
the decrease in product warranty costs is due in part to the fact that our warranty costs in included  in charges related to product retrofits and other costs associated with several products we sold to three ate manufacturers 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we recorded charges of approximately  as a result of negative trends in our historical claims experience 
there were no similar charges in commission expense decreased  primarily due to the significantly lower net revenue levels 
to a lesser extent  decreases in salary and benefits expense  travel expenses  freight and advertising also contributed to the decreased selling expense 
the decreases in these expense categories reflect both the aforementioned cost containment initiatives as well as decreased business activity 
these decreases were offset somewhat by an increase in marketing costs for our temperature management product segment for a specific program we implemented in related to our mm technology 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
we attribute the decrease primarily to an  reduction in salary and benefits expense 
this reduction was primarily the result of the aforementioned cost containment initiatives 
to a lesser extent there were also decreases in spending on travel and supplies 
these decreases were partially offset by a  increase in the use of third party consultants  primarily by our tester interface product segment related to specific product development projects 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in each of and there were decreases in travel and information technology costs during as compared to the same period in  which were offset by higher levels of incentive compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock 
during  we implemented a new company wide enterprise resource planning system 
the implementation process required significant additional travel and use of third party consultants to complete 
the system implementation was completed in  therefore  no charges associated with this process were recorded in in  we began granting restricted stock awards as a form of incentive compensation for certain members of management and directors 
the value of the shares granted is expensed over the four year vesting period 
the level of expense in was significantly lower than in since the first grant of restricted stock was not made until the fourth quar ter of restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges were  for compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
as previously discussed  the restructuring and other charges recorded during consisted of  in severance and related costs and  in lease termination costs resulting from the closure of our uk manufacturing operation 
in addition  we incurred  in severance and related costs associated with a workforce reduction at our facility in san jose  california 
the restructuring and other charges in consisted of severance costs of approximately  related to the reorganization of our domestic operations and long lived asset impairments of  related to our uk facility 
other income 
other income was  for compared to  for  an increase of  the increase in other income was due to the receipt of  in interest related to a domestic income tax refund we received during the second quarter of combined with an  decrease in foreign exchange transaction losses during as compared to income tax expense 
income tax expense was  for compared to  for our effective tax rate for was compared to in our income tax expense recorded during included a  tax benefit related to domestic income tax refunds we received during the second and third quarters of the year 
this amount was offset by foreign income tax expense we recorded on the earnings of certain of our foreign operations where we do not have net operating loss carryforwards to offset income tax expense on those earnings 
the income tax expense recorded during represents foreign income tax expense on the earnings of these same operations 
we increased our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets by  and  in and  respectively  due to taxable losses experienced in our domestic and certain foreign operations and the uncertainty surrounding whether we would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize these net oper ating loss carryforwards before they expire 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we believe the increase in our net revenues reflects the aforementioned stronger cyclical demand early in compared to the weaker demand throughout in  the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our manipulator docking hardware  temperature management and tester interface segments increased million or  million or and million or  respectively  over the comparable prior period 
we believe the increases in all of our product segments reflect the aforementioned increase in demand we experienced for our products throughout the first half of we believe the larger percentage increases in our manipulator docking hardware and tester interface segments reflect the increased production requirements of our customers during the first half of during the year ended december   our net revenues from customers in the us  eur ope and asia pacific increased  and  respectively  over the comparable prior period 
the larger percentage increase for our european customers was primarily the result of the significant appreciation of the euro against the us dollar during when adjusted to eliminate the effect of the change in exchange rates  the growth rate in the net revenues from our european customers was  which is consistent with both the us and asia pacific 
gross margin 
gross margin was for as compared to for the improvement in the gross margin was primarily the result of our fixed operating costs being more fully absorbed by the significantly higher net revenue levels in compared to while the absolute dollar amount of our fixed operating costs increased million in as compared to  the percentage of net revenues which these costs represent decreased from in to in we attribute the increase in the absolute dollar amount of our fixed operating costs primarily to higher salary and benefits expense which increased million over the comparable prior period 
this increase was due largely to the hiring of additional staff and the fact that as industry conditions improved during we began to reinstate certain previously eliminated employee benefits and our program of annual reviews and merit based salary increases 
also contributing to the increase in fixed operating costs  but to a lesser ex tent  were increases in insurance  third party consultants and facility rental 
the increases in both insurance and third party consultants were driven by the increased level of business activity in compared to selling expense 
selling expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to increased commission expense as well as higher levels of salary and benefits expense in as compared to the increase in commission expense of million in our manipulator docking hardware and temperature management segments was primarily due to the significantly higher net revenue levels 
the  increase in salary and benefits expense primarily reflects the reinstatement of certain employee benefits as previously discussed 
also contributing to the increase  but to a lesser extent  were increases in travel and freight expense  which were driven by the increased business activity in compared to engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of  or 
we attribute the increase primarily to a  increase in salary and benefits expense due largely to hiring additional staff and the reinstatement of certain employee benefits as previously discussed 
in addition  we had increased spending on engineering travel in our manipulator docking hardware segment due to the increased business activity in compared to these increases were partially offset by a reduction in fees paid to third party product development consultants in our manipulator docking hardware and temperature management segments 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for compared to million for  an increase of million or 
we attribute the increase primarily to a  increase in salary and benefits expense  which is largely a result of the reinstatement of employee benefits  as previously discussed 
also contributing to the increase was a  increase in professional fees  due primarily to increased audit fees  costs associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives and increased patent filing activities 
to a lesser extent  we attribute the increase to higher levels of administrative travel expense  accruals for profit based bonuses and an increase in the fees paid to members of our board of directors 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges were  for we had no comparable expenses incurred during the restructuring and other charges in consisted of severance costs of approximately  related to the reorganization of our domestic operations  as previously discussed  and long lived asset impairment of  related to our uk facility 
other income 
other income was  for compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in other income was primarily due to a significant increase in our foreign exchange transaction losses  which increased from  in to  in the increase in foreign exchange losses was due to the volatility throughout of the us dollar against the major foreign currencies we operate in worldwide 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was  for compared to million for our effective tax rate for was compared to in our income tax expense for represented the foreign income tax expense related to the earnings of certain of our foreign operations 
during  we increased our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets by  due to the taxable losses experienced in our domestic and certain foreign operations and the uncertainty surrounding whether we would be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize these losses before they expire 
during  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to our operating losses which resulted in the realizability of the net deferred tax assets to no longer be considered more likely than not 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was  compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operations in was primarily the result of our million net loss in compared to million of net income generated in also contributing to the decrease was a million increase in accounts receivable during the increase in accounts receivable at december  from december  was due to higher sales levels in the fourth quarter of compared to reduced level of sales in the fourth quarter of inventories decreased million during as a result of the sales activity during the year and stronger inventory management 
refundable domestic and foreign income taxes decreased  from december  to december  as a result of receiving federal and state refunds during  as previously discussed 
accounts payable increased  from december  to december  due to increased purc hases during the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period in the increase in purchases is a result of higher order levels in late as compared to the same period in other accrued expenses increased  primarily as a result of higher levels of accrued professional fees  accrued rent and accrued royalties at december  as compared to december  purchases of machinery and equipment were million for the year ended december   consisting of  of purchases we paid for directly and  of purchases paid for by our landlord 
the purchases of property and equipment we paid for directly consisted of  primarily for computer hardware  software and quality assurance equipment for our three domestic operations   for additional leasehold improvements and furniture for our tester interface division s new facility in san jose  california   for demonstration equipment for our temperature management and tester interface divisions and  related to the relocation of our machine shop in cherry hill  new jersey 
the balance was primarily for machinery and equipment for our foreign locations 
the purchases that were paid for by our landlord  which totaled  represent tenant improvements made at our tester interface division s new facility in san jose  ca  that we occupied during the first quarter of these tenant improvements were paid for by the landlord based upon the terms of our lease agreement 
at the time that we capitalized these assets  we recorded a liability in the same amount for deferred rent which will be amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term and recorded as a reduction of rent expense 
we have no commitments for capital expenditures for  however  depending upon changes in market demand  we will make such purchases as we deem necessary or appropriate 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  which represented the aforementioned  in deferred rent resulting from landlord provided tenant improvements  payments made under capital lease obligations of  and  of proceeds from stock options exercised 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our total committed contracts that will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows expected cash payments by year in thousands contractual commitments beyond total capital lease obligations operating lease obligations letters of credit inventory material purchase commitments we have a secured credit facility that provides for maximum borrowings of  we have not utilized this facility to borrow any funds 
our usage consists of the issuance of letters of credit in the face amount of  we pay a quarterly fee of per annum on the total amount of the outstanding letters of credit 
the terms of the loan agreement require that we maintain a minimum level of  of domestic cash 
this credit facility expires on september  we believe that our existing cash balances plus the anticipated cash to be provided from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
as previously discussed  during the second half of we entered a cyclical downturn in our industry and experienced a significant decline in our orders and sales activity that continued into although we began to see increases in our orders and sales activity during the second quarter of  we cannot be certain that this positive trend will continue or what the rate of increases or decreases in our quarterly net revenues and bookings will be in future periods 
as a result  we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet working capital or capital expenditure needs 
we cannot be certain that  if needed  we would be able to raise such additional financing or upon what terms such financing would be available

on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  goodwill  identifiable intangibles  deferred income tax valuation allowances and product warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ ma rkedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at standard cost  which approximates actual cost computed on a first in  first out basis  not in excess of market value 
on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record excess and obsolete inventory charges based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory

in  we recorded an inventory obsolescence charge for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
long lived asset valuation we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we prepare projections of operations for our product segments where these intangibles and or long lived assets are associated 
if the carrying value of the intangible assets and or long lived assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows per the projections  then we would record an impairment charge 
we measure the impairment based upon the projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
at december  long lived assets were million and no asset impairments were recorded during intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued goodwill at least annually  we review our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
if the result of this analysis indicates that an impairment charge is required  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets  resulting in an implied valuation of goodwill associated with the reporting unit 
we would measure the impairment based on the difference between the implied valuation of the goodwill and its actual carrying value 
during  we did not record any impairment charges for goodwill or identifiable intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets totaled million at december  income taxes deferred tax assets are analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
we assess all of the positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including our historical results of operations for the recent past and our projections of future results of operations  in which we make subjective determinations of future events 
if  after assessing all of the evidence  both positive and negative  a determination is made that the realizability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a deferred tax valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets depending upon the specific facts 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance established 
as of december   due to our history of operating losses  we have a valuation allowance aga inst all deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
product warranty accrual in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that may occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly differ from historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would need to be adjusted  and the amount of the adjustment could be material 
at december  accrued warranty was  and we incurred product warranty costs of  for the year then ended 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to our global operations 
we manufacture and sell our products primarily in north america  europe and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we manufacture and sell our products 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro  the singapore dollar and or the japanese yen 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our international businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates are generally reported as a component of stockholders equity as all of our foreign subsidiaries report in their local currencies 
total other comprehensive income loss was   and  in  and  respectively  due to cumulative translation adjustments 
as of december  and  our net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
intest corporaton form k for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we generally place our investments in us treasury obligations or money market funds backed by such investments 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for year ended december  would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments
