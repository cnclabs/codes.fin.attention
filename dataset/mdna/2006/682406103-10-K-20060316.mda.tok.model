item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a self administered and self managed reit and we primarily own real estate that we net lease to tenants 
as of december   we owned forty five properties  including a tenancy in common interest in one property  and participated in six joint ventures that owned a total of fourteen properties including one vacant property held for sale 
these fifty nine properties are located in twenty three states 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
we intend to comply with these requirements and to maintain our reit status 
our principal business strategy is to acquire improved  commercial properties subject to long term net leases 
we acquire properties for their value as long term investments and for their ability to generate income over an extended period of time 
we have borrowed funds in the past to finance the purchase of real estate and we expect to do so in the future 
our rental properties are generally leased to corporate tenants under operating leases substantially all of which are noncancellable 
substantially all of our lease agreements are net lease arrangements that require the tenant to pay not only rent  but also substantially all of the operating expenses of the leased property  including maintenance  taxes  utilities and insurance 
a majority of our lease agreements provide for periodic rental increases and certain of our other leases provide for increases based on the consumer price index 
during the year ended december   we purchased eight single tenant properties located in seven states  for a total consideration of million 
an aggregate of million of first mortgage financing was completed with respect to seven of these properties 
we are a venturer in two joint ventures organized for the purpose of acquiring and owning megaplex stadium style movie theaters 
we own a equity interest and are the managing member in each of these ventures with the same co venturer 
these joint ventures own one partial stadium style theater  eight megaplex stadium style movie theaters and a parcel of vacant land held for sale 
our equity investment in these movie theater ventures at december  was million  net of distributions from the joint ventures 
we are also a joint venturer in four additional joint ventures  each of which owns one single tenanted property 
our equity investment in these four joint ventures at december  was million  net of distributions 
at december   excluding mortgages payable of our unconsolidated joint ventures  we had outstanding mortgages payable  aggregating million in principal amount  all of which are secured by first liens on individual real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value  as adjusted for intangibles  of approximately million before accumulated depreciation 
the mortgages bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and mature between and results of operations outlook we anticipate that in we will use our available cash funds which was primarily derived from mortgages placed on unencumbered properties and the refinancing of existing mortgages and from property sales  funds derived from the placement of additional mortgages and our credit line to acquire additional properties  either directly or through joint ventures 
as a result  we will own more properties in and unless we experience an unexpected number of lease terminations and or cancellations in taking into consideration the lease expirations and terminations that we know will occur in  and without giving effect to any re letting of such properties  we anticipate that our revenues and possibly our net income will increase in comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues rental revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million dollars for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenues is substantially due to rental revenues earned during the year ended december  on fourteen properties acquired by us between march and november operating expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of fourteen properties between march and november general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a number of factors  the largest of which totaling  and representing approximately of the increase relates to the fees of special counsel retained by our audit committee in connection with its investigation into certain financial dealings of our former president and chief executive officer 
additional legal fees were incurred relating to a litigation arising out of the matter involving our former president and chief executive officer 
in addition  for the year ended december  expenses allocated to us under a shared services agreement among us and various affiliated companies  increased by  primarily due to an increase in our level of business activity  including property acquisitions  mortgage financings  sarbanes oxley act compliance  and activities related to the audit committee s investigation 
also included in the year ended december  is a  increase in compensation expense relating to the restricted stock program established in july the balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is due to increases in a number of items including auditing expenses  fees relating to our internal control audit  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  an increase in directors fees resulting primarily from additional fees to members of our audit committee in connection with its investigation  an increase in directors and officers liability insurance  and an increase in state taxes 
offsetting these increases in expenses was a decrease in payroll and payroll related expenses resulting from the resignation of our president and chief executive officer in july and a decrease in public company expense as we incurred a listing fee in in connection with the listing of our common stock on the new york stock exchange 
real estate expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to real estate operating expenses incurred at two vacant properties in  one of which was sold in and the other renovated and relet 
other income and expenses our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a million provision for valuation adjustment taken by one of our movie theater joint ventures against one of its five properties  of which  or million  is our share 
the decrease in our equity in earnings of joint ventures year versus year was also a result of the vacancy due to the rejection of the lease by the bankrupt tenant of a retail property owned by a joint venture in which we have a equity position  and the sale in by this venture of its bankruptcy claim against the former tenant 
the decrease in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures was offset in part by our share of income earned by two joint ventures organized in the second half of additionally  in  the operator of one of the movie theaters owned by one of our joint ventures sold its business to an independent third party  which sale resulted in the payment to us in of rental arrearages totaling  we have a interest in this joint venture and the payment resulted in an additional  in equity earnings to us for the year ended december  an additional increase in equity earnings to us in resulted from rent payments from the new tenant of this movie theater and the write off during the year ended december  of the entire balance of the unbilled rent receivable relating to this movie theater 
interest and other income decreased by  or to  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the receipt by us in of  of net acquisition fees from a joint venture we organized in that year 
the net acquisition fee reflects a reduction based on our ownership in the joint venture 
this decrease was offset  in part  by an increase of  in interest income earned in from the investment of funds obtained from mortgage financings and property sales 
interest expense increased by million  or  million of which resulted from mortgages placed on twelve properties between september and december and the assumption of a mortgage in connection with the purchase of one property in november the increases were offset by a  decrease in interest on a mortgage which was paid in full at its maturity during may interest expense related to our line of credit increased by  due to borrowings made to facilitate the purchase of several properties 
on june   we closed on the sale of unused development or air rights relating to our property located in brooklyn  new york 
the purchase price was approximately million and in addition  the purchaser paid some of our closing expenses 
the financial statement gain of million  recognized in the year ended december   has been deferred for tax purposes since we entered into a tax deferred exchange and used the sale proceeds to acquire an additional property 
discontinued operations in may  we sold a property located in jupiter  florida for million and recognized a gain of  in september  we sold a property located in cedar rapids  iowa for million and recognized a gain of  in october  we sold a property located in houston  texas for million and recognized a gain of  in november  we sold a property located in chattanooga  tennessee for million and recognized a gain of  during the year ended december   we determined that the estimated fair value of a property held for sale was lower then the carrying amount and we recorded a  provision for the difference 
this provision was in addition to the  provision on this property recorded by us for the year ended december  in early  the retail tenant at this property filed for bankruptcy protection  disaffirmed its lease and vacated the store 
this property was sold for a loss of  after giving effect to the  in total provisions in december the operations of these five properties and the gain or loss recognized on sale are reported as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december  these properties operated at a  loss as compared to positive operations in the year ended december  of million 
the net gain on sale of these five properties was million 
accordingly  we reported income from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of  year versus year 
comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues rental income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental income is primarily due to million of rental revenues earned during the year ended december  on eleven properties acquired by us during and there were also increases in rental income at several of our other properties 
operating expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the acquisition of eleven properties during and general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to a number of factors  including a  non recurring fee for the initial listing of our common stock on the new york stock exchange in january also  payroll and payroll expenses increased by  for the year ended december   including an increase of approximately  for executive and support personnel  primarily for legal and accounting services  allocated to us pursuant to a shared services agreement among us and related entities 
the increase in the allocated payroll expenses resulted from an increase in our level of business activity  primarily property acquisitions  the negotiation of an increased revolving credit facility  mortgage financings and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  including section requirements 
the increase in payroll expenses is due to a  increase in the annual base salaries and bonuses paid to our principal executive officers and additional staff 
also included in the year ended december  is compensation expense of  compared to  in the prior year relating to the restricted stock program which was established in july the balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is due to an increase in a number of items including professional fees of approximately  relating to costs associated with the internal control audit  including a review of the internal control documentation and testing relating to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  legal expenses relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and legal fees relating to transactions that were not consummated 
additionally  for the year ended december   state taxes increased by approximately  director and officer insurance and directors fees increased by approximately  and travel and other miscellaneous expenses increased by approximately  due to our increased business activity 
real estate expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to approximately  of utilities and operating expenses on a property which became vacant on july  when the tenant did not renew its lease 
this property was re let as of november  the increase was also due to real estate expenses on another vacant property in which the tenant filed for bankruptcy protection and disaffirmed its lease 
other income and expenses our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from our purchase of an additional interest in one of our movie theater joint ventures as of october   resulting in an increase in our equity in earnings of this joint venture of  for the year ended december  another joint venture in which we have a interest received  from the sale of its bankruptcy claim in connection with the bankruptcy proceeding involving its retail tenant which disaffirmed its lease and vacated the property 
our equity in earnings from this joint venture increased  for the year ended december  we also participate in two joint ventures  one organized in august and one organized in november these joint ventures each purchased one property  and in we recognized income of  and  respectively  from these joint ventures 
these increases were offset in part as a result of a million direct write off of unbilled rent receivable balances by one of our joint ventures in which we have a interest that were previously recorded relating to two movie theaters under common control 
we executed a lease termination agreement regarding one of these theaters which was under construction and since september  rent was paid in compliance with a stipulation relating to the other theater 
during february  the operator of this movie theater sold its business to an independent third party and the arrearages of rent and other miscellaneous charges of approximately  that were due in august were paid 
in exchange for the joint venture s agreement to consent to the lease assignment and lease amendment and to waive the requirement for a security deposit under the amended lease  the joint venture received  restricted shares of class a common stock of the tenant s parent company  which trades on the american stock exchange 
our equity in earnings of this joint venture decreased by  for the year ended december  interest and other income decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the receipt by us in the year ended of  of interest earned on short term mortgages receivable acquired or originated by us to facilitate acquisitions 
this decrease was offset  in part  by  of net acquisition fees received by us from a joint venture we recently organized 
the net acquisition fee  calculated pursuant to the joint venture agreement at of the purchase price of the acquired property  reflects a reduction based on our share of ownership in the joint venture 
the decrease was also offset  by a lesser extent  by interest earned on our investment of the balance of the net proceeds received from our october public offering of common stock 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase includes a million increase on our mortgages payable resulting from mortgages placed on two properties during and two properties during the last few months of  the assumption of mortgages in connection with the purchase of five properties during and and refinancing the mortgage on one property in may interest expense relating to our line of credit decreased by  resulting from our repayment of all of the outstanding indebtedness under our line of credit during we subsequently borrowed million under our line of credit during october and november  which was used to purchase a property and to fund our contribution to a joint venture which purchased a property 
during december  million of the borrowings were repaid with the proceeds from a mortgage financing of one of our properties 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations of five properties which were sold during the year ended december  increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  included in discontinued operations for the year ended december  is  received from the sale of our bankruptcy claim in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings involving a retail tenant which disaffirmed its lease and vacated the property 
this income was offset  in part  by a  provision for valuation allowance we took due to our determination that the estimated fair value of this property was lower than its carrying amount 
net income for the year ended december   net income applicable to common stockholders increased by million to million 
however  due to the issuance of million common shares in october in an underwritten public offering  net income per common share decreased by 
to  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  our revolving credit facility and cash generated from operating activities  including mortgage financings 
we are a party to a credit agreement with valley national bank  merchants bank division  bank leumi  usa  manufacturers and traders trust company and israel discount bank of new york which provides for a million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility is available to us to pay down existing mortgages  to fund the acquisition of additional properties or to invest in joint ventures 
the facility matures on march  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the lower of libor plus or at the bank s prime rate and there is an unused facility fee of one quarter of per annum 
net proceeds received from the sale or refinancing of properties are required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility if proceeds from the facility were used to purchase or refinance the property 
the facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own unencumbered properties and is secured by the outstanding stock of subsidiary entities 
as of december   and as of march  there is zero outstanding under the facility 
we are actively engaged in seeking additional property acquisitions and are involved in various stages of negotiation with respect to the acquisition of additional net leased properties 
we will use cash provided from operations  cash provided from mortgage financings and funds available under our credit facility to fund acquisitions 
the following sets forth our contractual cash obligations as of december   which relate to interest and amortization payments and balances due at maturity under outstanding mortgages secured by our properties for the periods indicated amounts in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years mortgages payable interest and amortization      mortgages payable balances due at maturity      total      as of december   we had outstanding approximately million in long term mortgage indebtedness excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
we expect that debt service payments of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that loan maturities of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from mortgage financings or refinancings 
if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow  funds available under our credit facility and available cash  if any  may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt when payments become due  and we may be forced to sell additional equity or dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms 
in addition  we  as ground lessee  are obligated to pay rent under a ground lease for a property owned in fee by an unrelated third party 
the annual fixed leasehold rent expense is as follows more than total years we had no outstanding contingent commitments  such as guarantees of indebtedness  or any other contractual cash obligations at december  cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder 
it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of each lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant is engaged and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we would be required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which would have an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken and would decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of any of our real estate assets in order to determine if there is any need for a provision for valuation adjustment 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
for each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist  recognition of impairment is required if the calculated value is less than the asset s carrying amount 
we generally do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any provision taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation adjustment  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
during the year ended december  the effect on the financial statements was not material 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
all of our long term mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages 
our credit line is a variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
therefore  our primary market risk exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest cost of draws on our line of credit 
under current market conditions  we do not believe that our risk of material potential losses in future earnings  fair values and or cash flows from near term changes in market rates that we consider reasonably possible is material 
the fair market value fmv of our long term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration 
the following table sets forth our long term debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date  weighted average interest rates and estimated fmv at december  amounts in thousands for the year ended december  there after total fmv long term debt         fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate
