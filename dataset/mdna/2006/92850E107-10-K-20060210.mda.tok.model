overview vitran corporation inc vitran or the company is a leading  predominantly non union  provider of surface transportation and related logistics services throughout canada and in states in the central  southwestern and western united states 
its business consists of three operating segments less than truckload services ltl  logistics services  and truckload services 
these services are provided by stand alone business units within their respective regions 
depending on a customer s needs  the units can operate independently or in a complementary manner 
as is more fully described in item business  the ltl segment transports shipments in less than full trailer load quantities through freight service center networks  the logistics segment provides supply chain solutions and freight brokerage services and the truckload segment delivers full trailer loads point to point on a predominantly short haul basis 
vitran s operating results are generally expected to depend on the number and weight of shipments transported  the prices received for the services provided  and the mix of services supplied to clients 
therefore  vitran must manage its fixed and variable operating cost infrastructure to fluctuating volumes to realize appropriate margins while maintaining the quality service expected by its customers 
the long term mission of the company is to build a north american transportation infrastructure with national and regional coverage in both canada and the united states offering regional  inter regional  national  and transborder ltl services 
in conjunction with the ltl services  vitran will also focus on logistics service offerings that are not only profitable as stand alone business opportunities  but also increase the utilization of ltl freight service assets where appropriate

selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in the increase in sg a expenses for the year can primarily be attributed to the addition of ctl on may  contributing to the remainder of the increase were increases in non cash employee stock options expense  corporate advertising expense  director compensation  sg a headcount within the logistics group  and salary and wage increases across all segments of the company 
with the addition of ctl and the increase in ongoing compensation related expenses  sg a will be higher in as compared to depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributed to the addition of ctl on may  however the company also purchased million of depreciable assets in compared to million in  which further increased the depreciation expense for the year 
interest expense net of interest income was million for compared to million for this increase was due to the acquisition of ctl on may  that consumed the majority of the company s interest generating short term investments 
consequently  interest expense on the company s outstanding debt was incurred and exceeded the interest income earned for the year 
income tax expense for was million compared to million in in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a one time deferred tax benefit of million attributable to the reduction in the valuation allowance on loss carryforwards 
the effective tax rate  excluding the one time deferred tax benefit  was for compared to the increase in the effective tax rate can be attributed to a higher proportion of income being earned in higher tax jurisdictions

revenue increased to million in compared to million in  driven by the acquisition of ctl on may  and the absence of a cn strike that persisted for five weeks in and corresponding intermodal capacity issues that persisted through the balance of these intermodal capacity issues that affected canadian ltl long haul operations were not as severe in  but a non unionized port of vancouver drayage driver work stoppage negatively offset revenue increases by million 
notwithstanding this  the ltl segment recorded revenue increases throughout the canadian and us infrastructure in all lines of business regional  national  expedited and  most notably  a increase in transborder revenue 
a firm pricing environment within the ltl segment  the acquisition of ctl and a stable economy led to increased shipments  tonnage and revenue per hundredweight of  and  respectively 
however  the aforementioned non unionized port of vancouver drayage driver work stoppage during the third quarter negatively offset income from operations increases by million 
notwithstanding this  income from operations improved to million in compared to million in and the ltl segment operating ratio improved to compared to in logistics the table below provides summary information for the logistics segment for the three years ended december in thousands vs vs revenue income from operations operating ratio revenue and income from operations for the logistics segment were up and for compared to revenue increases were attributable to improvements coming from the brokerage and supply chain business units 
although shipments for declined compared to in the brokerage unit  this was more than offset by a increase in revenue per shipment for in the supply chain business unit  revenue growth outpaced income from operations increases in as the business unit filled the capacity of the toronto distribution facility that was opened in also in the fourth quarter of  the supply chain business unit commenced full operations of its new western canadian dedicated distribution facility 
as a result the logistics segment improved its operating ratio to in from in truckload the table below provides summary information for the truckload segment for the three years ended december in thousands vs vs revenue income from operations operating ratio revenue for the truckload segment decreased to million in from million in with a strong pricing environment in the midwestern us attributable to a tight driver market that reduced capacity in the truckload market place  the company s truckload segment continued to focus on better yielding freight in consequently  revenue per total mile increased by while empty miles decreased by 
total shipments for decreased compared to  however  this was offset by the increase in revenue per shipment versus the aforementioned revenue quality development and yield progress increased gross margin to in however  offsetting these improvements was a million increase in accident costs in over these factors resulted in an operating ratio of for compared to in results of operations compared to consolidated results revenue increased to million in from million in revenue in the ltl  truckload and logistics segments increased  and  respectively  contributing to the consolidated improvement 
income from operations improved to million in from million in all three segments  ltl  truckload and logistics  contributed to the improvement posting increases of  and  respectively  to their income from operations 
accordingly  the company s consolidated operating ratio improved to in from in detailed explanations for the improvements in revenue and income from operations are discussed below in segmented results 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in the increase is partially attributable to the earlier adoption of new accounting standards for the expensing of employee stock options 
the new standard was applied prospectively and in resulted in a million non cash employee stock option expense compared to nil in an increase in sarbanes oxley certification expenses added an additional million in compared to the company s results include a foreign exchange gain of million from the repatriation of capital from a foreign subsidiary and from the sale proceeds from the equity offering in the fourth quarter of the remaining component of the increase is primarily the result of increases to workers compensation and health care expenses in the united states 
depreciation expense declined to million in from million in the company changed the estimated useful life for its tractors from seven years to eight years and its trailers from years to years to more accurately reflect the actual useful life of its equipment 
this change in estimate was recorded prospectively and resulted in a million reduction in depreciation expense for compared to interest expense net of interest income was million for compared to million for this reduction was primarily due to the company s million in short term investments generating interest income of million 
as well  the company repaid million of its outstanding debt obligations and had a basis point reduction in interest rate spreads starting in february income tax expense for was million compared to million in in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a one time deferred tax benefit of million attributable to the reduction in the valuation allowance on loss carryforwards 
the effective tax rate  excluding the one time deferred tax benefit  was for compared to in the increase in the effective tax rate can be attributed to an increase in statutory rates as well as a higher proportion of income being earned in higher tax jurisdictions 
net income improved by to million for  compared to million in this resulted in basic and diluted earnings per share of and for  compared to and in the weighted average number of shares for was million basic and million diluted compared to million basic and million diluted shares in the weighted average number of shares for includes the company s million share equity offering in the fourth quarter of  and dilution resulting from a majority of outstanding stock options in the money in segmented results ltl less than truckload in spite of the cn railway strike in the first quarter and railway capacity issues that persisted through the remainder of that significantly reduced ltl revenue  the segment increased revenue by to million from million in revenue increases were recorded throughout the canadian and us infrastructure in all lines of business regional  national  expedited and  most notably  a increase in transborder revenue 
a firm pricing environment within the ltl segment coupled with an improved economy led to increased shipments  tonnage and revenue per hundredweight of  and  respectively 
consequently  income from operations improved to million in compared to million in despite the improvement in income from operations  the ltl segment operating ratio of was only slightly better than the recorded in the aforementioned cn railway strike in the first quarter of  as well as railway capacity and railway operating challenges that persisted through the balance of  caused expenses in the national line of business to rise 
this resulted in an increase in linehaul expenses and dock wages as a percentage of revenue compared to same period in logistics revenue and income from operations for the logistics segment were up and for compared to revenue increases were attributable to improvements across all the logistics business units with strong growth coming from the supply chain unit 
revenue growth outpaced income from operations increases  as the supply chain unit worked to fill the capacity of its new distribution facility opened at the end of the second quarter 
gross margin declined in the second half of compared to  however  once the capacity of the new facility is fully utilized in  operating expenses as a percentage of revenue should decline and gross margin and operating ratio should improve 
truckload revenue for the truckload segment increased to million in from million in with a strong pricing environment in the midwestern us attributable to a tight driver market that reduced capacity in the truckload market place  the company s truckload segment focused on better yielding freight in consequently  revenue per total mile has increased by while empty miles have decreased by 
total shipments for decreased compared to  however  this was offset by the increase in revenue per shipment versus the aforementioned revenue quality development and yield progress increased gross margin to in  resulting in the operating ratio improving to from in notes a shipment is a single movement of goods from a point of origin to its final destination as described on a bill of lading document 
weight represents the total pounds shipped by each ltl business unit 
revenue per shipment represents revenue divided by the number of shipments 
revenue per hundredweight is the price obtained for transporting pounds of ltl freight from point to point  calculated by dividing the revenue for an ltl shipment by the hundredweight weight in pounds divided by for a shipment 
revenue per total mile represents revenue divided by the total miles driven 
general risks and uncertainties the company is exposed to a number of general risks and uncertainties that could impact the results 
the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service 
the company competes with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers  truckload carriers  third party logistics companies and  to a lesser extent  small package carriers  air freight carriers and railroads 
the company competes effectively in its markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 
the company s business is sensitive to general economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations  although these factors are mitigated somewhat by the variable nature of many of the company s costs 
recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customer business cycles  as well as downturns in the principal regional economies where the company s operations are located may affect results of operations 
in the trucking industry for a typical year  the second and third quarters usually have the highest business levels  while the first and fourth quarters generally have the lowest business levels 
the fourth quarter holiday season and adverse weather conditions  generally experienced in the first quarter of the year  such as heavy snow and ice storms  have a negative impact on operating results 
accordingly  revenue and profitability are generally lowest in the first and fourth quarters 
vitran is dependent on a major railroad for its national ltl service in canada 
any reduction in service by the railroad is likely to increase costs for the company and reduce the reliability  timeliness and overall attractiveness of rail based services 
for example  the railroad capacity issues that manifested in and improved moderately in impacted the results of operations of the company s ltl segment 
the company s exposure to credit risk is not significant as it is not dependent on any particular industry or customer 
the company s single largest customer accounted for of revenue in labor represents vitran s most significant cost and key to service quality 
the company has a history of positive labor relations that will continue to be important to future success 
the two unionized terminals in canada  representing of the company s labor force  are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters and the canadian autoworkers association 
the collective bargaining agreements between the company and its unionized employees expire on march  and on september   respectively 
the company is dependent on its ability to hire and retain qualified drivers including owner operators 
the ground transportation industry as a whole has experienced an imbalance in the number of qualified drivers for approximately the last five years 
the shortage has not affected the company in  but should an imbalance in the number of qualified drivers persist  vitran may adjust its compensation package or operate with fewer drivers  all of which could impact profitability 
furthermore  the company is dependent on certain key management personnel for the successful operation of the business 
loss of key personnel could harm vitran s operations and financial condition 
the company has exposure to foreign currency risk as fluctuations in the us dollar against the canadian dollar can impact the financial results of the company 
management has designated the company s million of us dollar denominated long term debt as a hedge to the foreign currency exposure generated by the company s us operations 
the company s canadian operations realize foreign exchange gains and losses on the us dollar revenue generated against expenses denominated in canadian dollars 
furthermore  the company reports its results in us dollars thereby exposing the results of the company s canadian operations to foreign currency fluctuations 
while diesel fuel expenses represent an important cost component to vitran  the extensive use of owner operators and the ability to share significant fuel increases with customers in the form of a fuel surcharge reduces this risk 
the company is subject to numerous laws and regulation by the dot  environmental protection agency epa  and various other federal  state  provincial and municipal authorities 
new or more comprehensive laws and regulation including but not limited to fuel emission  driver hours of service  taxation or other mandated regulation could impact profitability 
measures taken by the us and canadian governments to strengthen border security regulations could impact service levels 
vitran s cross border activity represented approximately of the ltl segment revenue in and the company has responded to the new requirements to ensure compliance and safety without jeopardizing the quality of service 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk at december  as the entire debt portfolio bears interest at floating rates 
in the past  management has used fixed interest rate instruments to mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and on an ongoing basis continues to evaluate the company s need to fix interest rates 
the company operates a highly capital intensive business 
vitran depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing and cash flow from operations to finance the purchase of tractors  trailing fleet  information technology hardware and terminals 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations before working capital changes for the year increased to million in compared to million in due primarily to the increase in net income 
non cash working capital changes consumed million primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable attributable to higher revenue in the increase was  however  mitigated by improved collections that resulted in days sales outstanding for compared to days for interest bearing debt was million at the end of consisting of million of term debt  capital lease of million and million drawn under the revolving credit facility 
at the end of interest bearing debt consisted of million of term debt and a capital lease of million 
during the year  the company repaid million of term debt in accordance with its scheduled commitments 
at december   the company had available million of unused credit facilities  net of outstanding letters of credit 
on may  the company acquired ctl for an aggregate purchase price of million  comprised of million of cash  common shares valued at million and an additional million of cash payable in april the cash portion of this acquisition was financed from the proceeds raised in december when the company issued and sold  in an underwritten public offering   common shares in consideration for net proceeds of million 
capital expenditures amounted to million for and were funded out of operating cash flows of the company 
the majority of capital expenditures in were for the acquisition of land for the construction of a new toronto service centre  information technology upgrades and rolling stock 
the table below sets forth the company s capital expenditures for the years ended december   and in thousands of dollars year ended december  real estate and buildings tractors trailing fleet information technology leasehold improvements other equipment total management estimates that cash capital expenditures  excluding real estate additions for  will be between million and million 
real estate additions  the majority of which will be for the construction of the new toronto service centre  will be between million and million 
the company also anticipates entering into operating leases to fund the acquisition of equipment with a capital cost of between million and million 
the company expects to finance its capital requirements with cash flow from operations  and if required  its million of unused credit facilities 
the company has contractual obligations that include long term debt consisting of a term debt facility  revolving credit facility  capital leases for operating equipment in the logistics segment and off balance sheet operating leases primarily consisting of tractor  trailing fleet and real estate leases 
operating leases form an integral part of the company s financial structure and operating methodology as they provide an alternative cost effective and flexible form of financing 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands of dollars payments due by period total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt libor    nil nil revolving credit facility cdn ba  nil  nil nil capital lease obligations nil nil sub total    nil nil off balance sheet commitments operating leases total contractual obligations in addition to the above noted contractual obligations  the company  as at december   utilized the revolving credit facility for standby letters of credit of million 
the letters of credit are used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit the company s ability to generate cash flow and affect its profitability 
the company s credit agreement contains certain financial maintenance tests that require the company to achieve stated levels of financial performance  which  if not achieved  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedules 
management does not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance and expects that existing working capital  together with available revolving facilities  is sufficient to fund operating and capital requirements in as well as service the contractual obligations 
outlook fiscal was another successful year for the company 
ctl was acquired on may  from the proceeds raised in the december public offering 
ctl expanded vitran s ltl coverage area into texas  kansas  oklahoma  and denver 
the ltl segment achieved a double digit transborder growth rate and both the canadian ltl and us ltl business units expanded revenue and yield 
although intermodal capacity issues persisted in  due to ongoing initiatives of ltl management the issues were not as severe as in however  despite management efforts  the us ltl business unit did not reduce its claims costs to the desired levels in the logistics and truckload segments posted improvements in compared to by increasing their customer base and leveraging margins with existing customers 
for  vitran s objective is still to acquire or develop its ltl operation into new regional markets 
management will continue to evaluate ltl expansion opportunities with a view to ensuring the appropriate fit to its existing ltl network 
at december   the company had million of cash and million of unused credit facilities 
management intends to continue its focus on the ltl transborder business with a view to maintaining above average year over year revenue growth 
the canadian ltl business unit will endeavor to improve third party linehaul efficiency activities and commence building the new toronto service centre 
the us ltl business unit plans to execute a sales strategy that will increase inter regional growth at above average rates between the midwestern and southwestern regions 
furthermore  focus will be on linehaul efficiency and dock operations with the objective of reducing claims expense in with the acquisition of swe on january   management intends to focus on building the western regional ltl sales density as well as upgrading swe s information systems in order to provide the infrastructure to support inter regional growth initiatives 
the logistics segment will continue to concentrate on gaining new profitable business that also utilizes the services of the company s ltl infrastructure 
vitran management expects continued tightness in the truckload driver market  therefore  the truckload segment will focus on driver retention and margin expansion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada together with a reconciliation to united states gaap  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the financial statements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on a regular basis  based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
significant estimates are used in determining  but not limited to  the allowance for doubtful accounts  claims and insurance accruals and the fair value of reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment tests 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition the company s ltl and truckload business units and freight brokerage operations recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment costs as incurred 
revenue for the logistics operations is recognized as the management services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable that may potentially be impaired 
the allowance is based on the company s knowledge of the financial condition of its customers  the aging of the receivables  current business environment  customer and industry concentrations  and historical experience 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated allowance and the provision for bad debts recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims  including amounts for claims incurred but not reported  for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health 
in canada the company has  cdn  and in the united states between  and  self insurance retention sir per incident for auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
in the united states the company has an sir of  to  per incident for workers compensation and  per incident for employee medical 
in establishing these accrued expenses  management evaluates and monitors each claim individually  and uses factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
changes in severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of the plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
goodwill and intangible assets the company performs its goodwill impairment test annually  and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred 
impairment is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount to its implied fair value 
the methodology used to measure fair value is the discounted cash flow method 
the discounted cash flow method requires certain assumptions for growth in earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  future tax rates  capital re investment  fair value of the assets and liabilities  and discount rate 
the discount rate is based on the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital 
actual recovery of goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event goodwill is determined to be impaired a charge to earnings would be required 
as at september   vitran completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment 
the company  for the acquisition in  allocated purchase price to intangible assets based on management s estimates supported by independent appraisals 
capital assets capital assets are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
management establishes appropriate useful lives for all capital assets and continuously evaluates and updates these when circumstances warrant 
actual carrying value of assets could differ based on different assumptions  estimates or other factors 
changes in accounting policy the cica accounting standards board has issued the following new accounting standards that the company will adopt effective january  the impact of these new standards on the consolidated financial statements is not yet determinable as it will be dependent on the outstanding positions at the time of transition 
comprehensive income this section establishes standards for the reporting and disclosure of comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive income

specifically  all financial asset instruments will be classified as one of the following held to maturity  loan and receivables  held for trading or available for sale 
hedging this section establishes standards for when and how hedge accounting may be applied 
the standard specifies criteria under which hedge accounting can be applied and how hedge accounting can be executed for each of the permitted hedging strategies fair value hedges  cash flow hedges and hedges of foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a self sustaining foreign operation 
related parties in  the company leased a terminal from a former director at market rates 
lease expense for this terminal amounted to  in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings under the term bank facility and revolving credit facility that have variable interest rates tied to the libor rate and canadian ba rate  respectively 
the term bank credit facility of million had a weighted average annual interest rate on borrowings of in we estimate that the fair value of the term credit facility and revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value
