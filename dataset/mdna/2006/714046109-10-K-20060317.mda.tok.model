 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  as some employees who were notified of their employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax restructuring reversal of million due to fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination  and accordingly  lower severance costs 
q plan in connection with our decision to combine our life sciences and analytical instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million during the fourth quarter of  which we refer to as our q plan 
the q plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide  with the intention to better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses sales  service  and research and development organizations 
the principal actions in the q plan included planned workforce reductions of people  closure of approximately facilities  and disposal of underutilized assets 
the q plan resulted in the integration of our united states life and analytical sciences sales  service and customer care centers  the integration of european customer care and finance centers  the merging of a former life sciences european manufacturing facility with a former analytical instruments european manufacturing facility  and the merging of a portion of a former life sciences research and development facility in europe with a former analytical instruments facility in europe 
during  we expended million to execute these actions

the principal actions in the q plan included the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in europe  as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in europe  the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the united states  and the disposal of related assets 
in  we recorded an additional pre tax restructuring charge associated with the q plan of million 
this charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment 
in  we expended million to execute the actions associated with the q plan 
we expect to pay the remaining balance in for previously identified employees associated with the closure of our european manufacturing facility in the life and analytical sciences segment

the increase was partially offset by a corresponding decrease in interest expense on our senior subordinated notes that were purchases pursuant to our tender offer in the fourth quarter of  as well as a lower average outstanding term loan balance which was approximately million 
in addition  we recognized a gain on sale of investments of million associated with the liquidation of an investment

these benefits were partially offset by an accrual of million for the estimated us tax cost of repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the american jobs creation act of discontinued operations we recorded the following gains and losses  which we report as the gain loss on dispositions of discontinued operations  during the years ended january  and january  in thousands gain on the sale of aerospace business gain on the sale of fluid testing business loss on the sale of fiber optics test equipment business loss on the sale of lithography business gain on the resolution of contingencies associated with the technical services business gain loss on other discontinued businesses net gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes gain loss on disposition of discontinued operations  net of income taxes in september  our board of directors approved a plan to divest our fluid sciences business segment to increase our strategic focus on our higher growth markets within the life and analytical sciences and optoelectronics businesses 
the fluid sciences business segment consisted of three businesses aerospace  fluid testing and semiconductor 
in november we sold the fluid testing business to caleb brett usa inc for approximately million  resulting in a net pre tax gain of million 
in december  we sold the aerospace business to eaton corporation for approximately million  resulting in a net pre tax gain of million 
we recognized these gains during fiscal we received total cash proceeds in these transactions of approximately million 
on february   we sold substantially all of the assets of our semiconductor business to an entity affiliated with tara capital  inc for approximately million subject to a net working capital adjustment and additional contingent consideration that could bring the total proceeds received to more than million 
we are currently in the process of computing the gain on the transaction and will record such amount in the first quarter of as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth markets  in december  our board of directors also approved a plan to sell our lithography business 
we received proceeds of million upon the sale of the business and recognized a pre tax loss of million

in june  our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our fiber optics test equipment business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities 
we previously had reported the results of this business as part of the optoelectronics reporting segment 
the shut down of this business resulted in a million loss related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value 
in august  certain assets that were previously written down were subsequently sold resulting in a gain of million 
as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities  in june  our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our electroformed products business and sell our ultraviolet lighting 
table of contents business 
in september  our board of directors approved a plan to shut down our computer to plate business 
we previously had reported the results of all three of these businesses as part of the optoelectronics reporting segment 
the net assets of the electroformed products business were written off resulting in a million pre tax loss for the year ended january  we sold the fixed assets and inventory of the ultraviolet lighting business in july for their approximate book value 
the abandonment of the computer to plate business resulted in a million write down of fixed assets and inventory 
during and  we settled various claims under certain long term contracts and transition services with our technical services business  which we sold in august the net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pre tax gains of million in and million in summary operating results of the discontinued operations were as follows in thousands sales costs and expenses operating income from discontinued operations other expense income from discontinued operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes acquisitions in february  we acquired elcos ag  a leading european designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode  or led  solutions for biomedical and industrial applications 
consideration for the transaction was approximately million in cash at the time of closing  million of additional payments in and approximately million due through fiscal also  we estimate that under an earn out provision in the acquisition agreement we will make an additional cash payment of approximately million in to reflect the performance of the business in  with the potential for additional earn out payments being made in and based on the performance of the business in and  respectively 
contingencies  including tax matters we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites 
we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we have accrued million as of january   representing our management s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters 
this amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential remedies  possible joint and several liability  the timeframe over which remediation may occur  and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party  our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute 
we expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years 
as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
while it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred  we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different from the amounts we recorded 

table of contents in papers dated october   enzo biochem  inc and enzo life sciences  inc enzo filed a complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  civil action no 
 against amersham plc  amersham biosciences  perkinelmer  inc  perkinelmer life sciences  inc  sigma aldrich corporation  sigma chemical company  inc  molecular probes  inc  and orchid biosciences  inc 
the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo  infringed enzo s patents  engaged in unfair competition and fraud  and committed torts against enzo by  among other things  engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo s patented products and technology  separately and together with the other defendants 
enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief 
on may   the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants 
enzo served its new complaint on july   and we subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including a counterclaim alleging that several of enzo s patents are invalid 
during the last half of  fact discovery was largely completed and a markman hearing was conducted regarding the construction of the claims in enzo s patents 
the court has not yet issued its decision regarding claim construction or set a date for trial 
on october   amersham biosciences corp 
filed a complaint  which was subsequently amended  in the united states district court for new jersey  civil action no 
 against one of our subsidiaries alleging that our viewlux and certain of our image flashplates infringe three of amersham s patents related to high throughput screening the nj case

 alleging that amersham s in cell analyzer  leadseeker multimodality imaging system and certain cyclic amp and ip assays infringe two of our patents related to high throughput screening the ma case 
we seek injunctive and monetary relief 
amersham subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including affirmative defenses and counterclaims 
trial in the uk case was completed in december in february  the court ruled that amersham s patent in question was invalid in the united kingdom and awarded costs to us 
in the nj case  discovery regarding issues of liability  which have been bifurcated from issues of damages  has largely been completed and a markman hearing on claim construction is anticipated in early no trial date has been set 
in the ma case  discovery is ongoing 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings  and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above matters 
we are currently unable  however  to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in  we resolved certain claims  including the securities litigation described in part i of this annual report on form k under item legal proceedings 
the resolution of these claims did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
during  the internal revenue service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years through we have agreed to all matters with the exception of one  and have filed a single issue protest with the appeals division of the internal revenue service  and expect to resolve the matter in regardless of the outcome of this matter  we do not expect final resolution to significantly impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in we are under regular examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities in the united states and other countries  such as germany  the united kingdom  and states in which we have significant business operations  such as california and new york 
the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction  with the most significant one being that undertaken by the german tax authority for the years through 
table of contents during the year  in addition to the irs audit described above  we concluded audits concerning income tax matters affecting certain of our subsidiaries with texas  illinois  the united kingdom  canada  and belgium 
as a result of concluding the federal  state  and foreign audits during  we recognized a benefit of million 
we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations 
tax reserves have been established  which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments 
once established  reserves are adjusted as information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves 
the resolution of current tax audits is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition  although adjustments related to the examination process or audit settlement could have a material impact on our income tax expense  cash flow  and consolidated statement of income for a particular future period 
we are also subject to various other claims  legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
each of these matters is subject to uncertainties  and it is possible that some of theses matters may be resolved unfavorably to us 
in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements

the new senior unsecured credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes which may include fulfilling working capital needs  refinancing existing indebtedness  making capital expenditures  repurchasing shares  or consummating acquisitions and strategic alliances 
the interest rates under the senior unsecured credit facility are based on the eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin  or the base rate from time to time 
the base rate is the higher of the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america  na and the federal funds rate plus basis points 
we may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate 
the eurocurrency margin as of january  was basis points  the weighted average eurocurrency rate was 
there were approximately million of borrowings under the facility as of january  with interest based on the above described eurocurrency rate 
at year end  the borrowings were undertaken by certain foreign subsidiaries of ours and the funds were borrowed in the subsidiaries functional currencies of euro eur  canadian dollars cad and japanese yen jpy 
the effective rates of the borrowings as of january  were as follows eur  cad and jpy 
our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  and a maximum total leverage ratio 
at all times during  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 

table of contents prior to the fourth quarter of  we had a number of borrowings from a number of different sources 
these included our senior secured credit facility which was established in december this facility was the predecessor to the senior unsecured credit facility described above and was terminated in october this facility comprised a six year term loan in the amount of million and a million five year secured revolving credit facility 
in  prior to the above described refinancing  we made million of principal payments on the term loan 
interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility were determined as a margin over either the eurodollar rate or the base rate 
the base rate was the higher of the corporate base rate announced from time to time by bank of america  na and the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility varied based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter 
in october  we amended the senior credit facility to allow greater flexibility regarding acquisitions  stock repurchases  debt reduction and cash repatriation 
our prior revolving credit facility was available to us through december for our working capital needs 
at no point in fiscal  nor at any other time  did we have any outstanding principal balance under this prior revolving credit facility 
our senior credit facility which terminated in october contained covenants that required us to maintain specific financial ratios  including a minimum interest coverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and a maximum senior leverage ratio 
at all times during  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants 
senior subordinated notes issued in december these were ten year senior subordinated notes issued at a rate of with a face value of million the senior subordinated notes 
in the second quarter of  we repurchased million of this debt 
the senior subordinated notes had an outstanding balance as of october  of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced and substantially completed a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes 
on november   as part of an initial settlement under the tender offer  we repurchased million of the senior subordinated notes 
we completed the tender offer and repurchased all but thousand of these notes as of november  the source of funds for the tender offer was comprised of proceeds from the sale of our fluid testing business  our cash and cash equivalents  and our new unsecured credit facility 
in connection with the tender offer  we solicited consents to amend the indenture under which the senior subordinated notes were issued and removed most of the restrictive covenants from the indenture 
in january  we swapped the fixed rate on million of the senior subordinated notes to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semi annually in arrears based upon six month usd libor and an applicable spread as defined in the swap agreements 
in january  we swapped an additional million of these notes from fixed rate to floating rate at similar terms to the january swap  and therefore we were obligated to pay the applicable six month usd libor rate  plus the applicable spread  on million of our obligations represented by the notes 
on november   we terminated the interest rate swaps in conjunction with our tender of the senior subordinated notes at a cost of million 
notes issued by one of our acquired companies 
in december  we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding notes 
we completed the tender offer and repurchased all but million of these notes as of december  the remaining principal balance of million matured and was paid in the fourth quarter of

the total funding capacity under this facility is million 
amounts funded under this facility were million at both january  and january  as of january   we had approximately million of undrawn capacity available under the facility 
the facility had an effective interest rate of approximately libor plus basis points as of january  the facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of bb or above  as defined by standard poor s rating services  and ba or above  as defined by moody s investors service 
at january   we had a senior unsecured credit rating of bbb with a stable outlook from standard poor s rating services  and of baa with a stable outlook from moody s investors service 
the facility expires on january  dividends our board of directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of and  resulting in an annual dividend rate of cents per share

subordinated notes due other revolving debt facilities total in thousands and beyond total because the credit facility borrowings are considered to carry variable interest rates  the above table does not contemplate interest obligations 
capital expenditures during  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million to million primarily to introduce new products  to improve our operating processes  to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations  to relocate certain administrative facilities  and to capitalize expenses related to internally developed information technology 
we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 
other potential liquidity considerations in february  we acquired elcos ag  a leading european designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode  or led  solutions for biomedical and industrial applications 
the transaction combines elcos visible led technology platform and strong customer and application base with our global sales  application and support organization  therefore expanding the sales growth opportunities for the elcos technology 
we paid 
table of contents approximately million in cash at the time of closing  million in additional payments in  and are required to make future cash payments of approximately million through fiscal also  we estimate that under an earn out provision in the acquisition agreement we will make an additional cash payment of approximately million in to reflect the performance of the business in  with the potential for additional earn out payments being made in and based on the performance of the business in and  respectively 
on october  our board of directors reaffirmed our authority to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock  which we publicly disclosed on november  the program 
this program will expire on october   unless it is earlier terminated by our board of directors 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million shares of our common stock in the open market under the program at an aggregate cost of million 
subsequent to year end  we repurchased million shares of our common stock in the open market under the program at an average cost of per share

 statement of cash flows 
this statement addressed the accounting for share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options 
under the new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb opinion no 
instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share based payments in the statement of operations 
sfas r is effective for us as of january  we historically accounted for share based payments to employees under apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method 
as such  we have not recognized compensation expense for options granted to employees 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r under the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of sfas r  and compensation cost for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that are unvested as of the effective date of sfas r is recognized based on sfas tax benefits will be recognized related to the cost for share based payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law 
tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the expense recorded in the statement of operations to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the fair value cost 
our current estimates associated with indicate that we will recognize stock option compensation expense of approximately cents per share 
this amount is subject to revisions as we finalize certain assumptions related to  including the size and nature of awards and forfeiture rates 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financial cash flow rather than as operating cash flow as was required 
we cannot estimate what the future tax benefits will be as the amounts depend on  among other factors  future employee stock option exercises 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no

this interpretation provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
the interpretive guidance is intended to assist companies in applying the provisions of sfas r  and investors and users of the financial statements in analyzing the information provided 
we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab no

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met 
we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element  all in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
further  we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and  when necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
we completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill 
table of contents for and and concluded that there were no impairments 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
in addition  we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite  the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
employee compensation and benefits 
retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in  million in and million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
we expect expenses of approximately million in for our retirement and post retirement plans 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied  to determine service cost and interest cost  in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of january   we estimated the expected long term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was  and was for plans outside the united states 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets  as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions have been  and continue to be  based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
if any of our assumptions were to change  our pension plan expenses would also change 
a one quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by million for in the united states and by million for for all plans outside the united states 
a one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre tax pension expense by million for in the united states and by million for for all plans outside the united states 
we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature 
under the defined dollar plan feature  our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount  regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree 
our maximum future liability  therefore  cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 
restructuring activities 
our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and asset impairments as discussed above under value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
for example  actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance  or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected 
in addition  unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates 
when such changes in estimates occur  they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled restructuring charges  net 

table of contents gains or losses on dispositions 
when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation  we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
during the year ended january   we recognized million in gains from disposition of fixed assets 
we also recorded million in gains from the disposition of discontinued operations  which was comprised of gains from the final disposition of our aerospace  fluid testing  telecommunications components and technical services businesses  offset by losses associated with the disposition of our fiber optics test equipment and lithography businesses 
any such changes decrease or increase current earnings  and are recorded either against the gains on disposition or discontinued operations line items appearing in our income statement 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations in which the ultimate tax determination is not certain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
where appropriate  we reserve for tax matters when we believe that the likelihood of an incremental liability being incurred is probable in accordance with the provisions of fas and fas any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  or our cash flow 
additionally  in accordance with fas we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  and other income tax credits 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
improvements or other changes in our operations  domestically and internationally  could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter company and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed 
table of contents months  have no cash requirements until maturity  and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking institutions 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
for the year ended january   we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges 
the notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately million at january  and million as of january   and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant 
the duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts was generally days for market risk market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures can take a variety of different forms as our international sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results 
reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  can fluctuate due to exchange rate movements 
while exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported revenues and earnings  this impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows 
in all parts of the world  our subsidiaries  on occasion  invoice third party customers in foreign currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business 
we refer to our subsidiaries primary business currencies as the functional currencies 
movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency result in both realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations 
our manufacturing and distribution organization is worldwide 
accordingly  inventories may be manufactured in one location  stored in another  and distributed in a third location 
this results in a wide array of intercompany transactions transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies 
our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies involved 
the cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time 
accordingly  there may be times when a subsidiary lends to or borrows from either the parent company or another affiliate 
these advances  again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entity s functional currency  can expose it to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations 
in order to repay debt or satisfy operational needs  we may remit cash from our foreign locations to the united states 
when this occurs  we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into united states dollars 
our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also impacted by these transactions 
we may use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
the derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes 
we specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated assets and liabilities and may use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies 
to the extent 
table of contents that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the principal currencies we hedge are the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  japanese yen  and singapore dollar 
in those currencies where there is a liquid  cost effective forward market  we maintain hedge coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure 
we utilize a value at risk model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program 
our value at risk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of january   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this value at risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal  the value at risk ranged between million and million  and averaged approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described above  our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows  as they relate to interest  and our earnings 
in january and january  we effected  for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio  interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
these swaps were designated as fair value hedges  and were marked to market in our consolidated financial statements  while they remained outstanding 
the fair value movements in these swaps were offset by the fair value movement in the debt 
interest rate risk sensitivity 
as of january   our debt portfolio was comprised of million of variable rate debt 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents  for which we receive interest at variable rates  were million at january our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt  consisting of million of revolving debt facilities  to fluctuate 
an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of 
million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
as described above  an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by 
million for fiscal year changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate
