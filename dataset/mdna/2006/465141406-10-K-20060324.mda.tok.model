overview isramco  inc  a delaware corporation  is active in the exploration of oil and gas in israel and the united states 
the company acts as an operator of certain leases and licenses and also holds participation interests in certain other interests 
the company also holds certain non oil and gas properties discussed below 
critical accounting policies estimation of oil and gas reserves is important to the effective management of the company 
they are integral to making investment decisions about oil and gas properties such as whether development should proceed or enhanced recovery methods should be undertaken 
oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis of calculating the unit of production rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment 
oil and gas reserves are divided between proved and unproved reserves 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
unproved reserves are those with less than reasonable certainty of recoverability and are classified as either probable or possible 
the estimation of proved reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines 
although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced  the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and significant changes in long term oil and gas price levels 
the calculation of unit of production depreciation is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of upstream assets 
it is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves those proved reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods applied to the asset cost 
the volumes produced and asset costs are known and  while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
our cruise line operation is capital intensive 
at december   we have approximately million of net investment in the vessel recorded on our balance sheet 
we depreciate our assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimates of the useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events  such as property expansions  new competition and new regulations  could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than is temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the company does not participate in  nor has it created  any off balance sheet special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing 
in addition  the company does not enter into any derivative financial instruments 
the company records a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long live assets 
liquidity and capital resources the company finances its operations primarily from cash generated by operations 
the company s operating activities provided net cash of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the availability of cash generated by operations could be affected by other business risks discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report 
working capital current assets minus current liabilities was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to the purchase of oil and gas assets  participation in drilling of two wells in united states and investments in repairs and renovation of the cruise line vessel net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in net cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to the purchase in march and maintenance  repairs and renovation of the vessel  and the outlays associated with the drilling of wells in texas and oklahoma  offset by the increase in the value of marketable securities 
the cash used in investing activities in was primarily attributable to purchase of oil and gas properties 
capital expenditures for property and equipment were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
capital expenditures in were primarily attributable to purchase of oil and gas properties in the united states 
capital expenditures in were primarily attributable to purchase of the cruise line vessel 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company reported net loss before cumulative effect of  loss of per share in compared to a net profit of  loss of per share in the decrease in the net income in compared to is primarily attributable to i an increase in losses associated with the operation of the vessel  ii an increase in the impairment of oil and gas assets  iii an increase in lease operation expenses of the wells in the united states and iv an increase in the general and administration expenses

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to sfas no 
r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
sfas no 
r shall be effective for small business issuers as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the company during the calendar year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including adverse changes in commodity prices 
the company produces and sells natural gas and crude oil 
as a result  the company s financial results can be significantly affected if these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces
