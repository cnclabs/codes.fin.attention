executive summary tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic films and aluminum extrusions 
descriptions of our businesses are provided on pages income from continuing operations was million cents per diluted share in compared with million cents per diluted share in gains on the sale of assets  investment write downs and other items and losses related to plant shutdowns  assets impairments and restructurings are described in results of operations beginning on page the business segment review begins on page in film products  operating profit from ongoing operations was million in compared with million in the improvement over last year was due primarily to growth in higher value added products including apertured  elastic and surface protection materials  partially offset by higher resin costs 
we estimate that the adverse impact on operating profit of the lag in passing through higher resin costs net of the favorable effect of a decline in inventories accounted for under the last in first out method in the fourth quarter of compared with the third quarter of was approximately million 
fourth quarter operating profit was also adversely affected by the lag of passing through higher resin prices of around million compared with the third quarter of resin prices continued to escalate to record high levels in the fourth quarter of due to supply shortages related to the gulf coast hurricanes 
average quarterly prices of low density polyethylene resin in the us increased cents per pound or in the quarter see the chart on page 
resin prices in europe and south america exhibited similar trends 
to reduce the impact of resin price fluctuations  we have index based pass through agreements for the majority of our business 
however  under certain agreements  changes in resin costs are not passed through for an average period of days 
for non indexed customers  we have implemented price increases to reduce the negative impact of higher resin costs 
capital expenditures in in film products were million and primarily supported capacity expansions for higher value added materials and a new global information system 
aggregate capital spending for years totaled approximately million 
about one third of this capital spending relates to customer specific opportunities that are covered by capital indemnification  contractual volume commitments or similar arrangements 
capital expenditures are expected to be about million in  about half of which is for additional capacity to meet growing demand for surface protection films 
these films are primarily used to protect flat panel display components during fabrication  shipping and handling 
sales of surface protection films totaled approximately million in  up from million in  and are expected to grow further 
planned capital expenditures also include expansion of capacity to support elastic material growth opportunities 
sales of elastic materials are expected to continue growing as manufacturers of diapers and adult incontinence products add more stretch to their products to improve comfort and fit 
in aluminum extrusions  operating profit from ongoing operations declined to million in from million in due mainly to higher energy costs approximately million and strength of the canadian dollar about million  partially offset by price increases  higher volume and an energy surcharge 
annual volume increased to million pounds in from million pounds in the average costs for natural gas  electricity and diesel fuel were significantly higher in compared with see the natural gas price chart on page 
for every per mmbtu change in the price of natural gas  the company expects a corresponding operating profit impact in aluminum extrusions of approximately  per month 
during  we announced price increases in aluminum extrusions in april and september 
in september  we also announced an energy surcharge in the us to be applied when the previous quarter s nymex natural gas average settlement price is in excess of per mmbtu 
capital expenditures in aluminum extrusions were million in and are expected to be approximately million in profit growth in is expected to be driven by focusing on improving volume for operations in canada  higher volume anticipated from hurricane related rebuilding  price increases  the energy surcharge and cost reductions from productivity enhancements 
on june   substantially all of the assets of afbs  inc formerly known as therics  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of tredegar  were sold or assigned to a newly created limited liability company  therics  llc  controlled and managed by an individual not affiliated with tredegar 
for more information  see the business segment review beginning on page we refinanced our debt in december with a million five year unsecured revolving credit facility 
net capitalization and other credit measures are provided in the liabilities  credit and long term obligations section beginning on page critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december of each year 
we have made determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill and intangible assets should be allocated to those reporting units 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if impairment tests are met or the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based upon assessments performed  we recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations related to long lived identifiable assets of million in  million in and million in pension benefits we have noncontributory and contributory defined benefit pension plans that have significant net pension income developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
the discount rate is the single rate that  when applied to expected benefit payments  provides a present value equal to the present value of expected benefit payments determined by using the aa rated bond yield curve 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
we reduced our weighted average discount rate in each of the last three years the rate was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of due to the decline in market interest rates 
the compensation increase assumption affects the estimate of future payments  and was at the end of  and a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
during  and  the value of our plan assets increased due to improved general market conditions after declining in  and our expected long term return on plan assets has been since based on market and economic conditions and asset mix our expected return was in and in and prior years 
see page for more information on expected long term return on plan assets and asset mix 
we currently expect net pension income to decline in by approximately million compared with after declining by approximately million in compared with and  in compared with we expect our minimum cash funding requirement to be about  in income taxes many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are actually paid  rather than when the expenses are recorded for book purposes 
in these circumstances  we accrue for the tax benefit expected to be received in future years if  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that we will receive such benefits 
in addition  the amount and timing of certain current deductions which reduce taxes currently payable or generate income tax refunds require interpretation of tax laws 
in these circumstances  we estimate and accrue income tax contingencies for differences in interpretation that may exist with tax authorities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our judgments regarding income tax contingency accruals and the likelihood the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
during the periodic reviews  we must consider a variety of factors  including the nature and amount of the tax income and expense items  the current tax statutes  the current status of audits performed by tax authorities and the projected future earnings 
we believe the realization of our net deferred tax assets is reasonably assured and that our income tax contingency accruals are adequate 
if circumstances change  our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  income tax contingency accruals and net earnings are adjusted accordingly in that period 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of changes in accounting principles and error corrections 
it requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard will have no impact on cash flow  and we do not expect it to have an impact on amounts reported in the consolidated statement of income and balance sheet 
in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 share based payment 
this statement requires that the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity instruments be measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the statement also requires that the cost be recognized over the employee service period required to receive the award 
the statement applies to awards granted after the effective date and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
the statement is effective beginning the first fiscal year that begins after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard will have no impact on cash flow 
the primary impact of adoption on tredegar will be the recognition of compensation expense for stock options granted 
currently  we disclose the pro forma effects of treating stock option grants as compensation expense under the fair value based method see pages 
we will transition to the new standard during the first quarter of using the modified prospective method and continue to use the black scholes options pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of option grants 
we believe that the pro forma effects that have been disclosed are not materially different from compensation expense that would have been recognized if this standard had been previously adopted 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be expensed as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during the fiscal years beginning after june  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this standard will have no impact on cash flow  and we do not expect it to have a significant impact on amounts reported in the consolidated statement of income and balance sheet

fsp provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer as provided for in the ajca 
we do not expect that the tax benefits resulting from the ajca will have a material impact on our financial statements

see note on page we believe that existing borrowing availability  our current cash balances and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and dividend requirements for the foreseeable future 
from time to time  we enter into transactions with third parties in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the buyers or third parties involved in the sale for certain liabilities or risks related to the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of our business  we may enter into agreements with third parties for the sale of goods or services that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability for indemnification would be subject to an assessment of the underlying facts and circumstances under the terms of the applicable agreement 
further  any indemnification payments may be limited or barred by a monetary cap  a time limitation  or a deductible or basket 
for these reasons  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of the potential future liability under the indemnity provisions of these agreements 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is probable 
we disclose contingent liabilities if the probability of loss is reasonably possible and significant

net cash used in financing activities was million in compared with million in this increase was driven by scheduled debt payments and debt payments made in conjunction with our refinancing in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tredegar has exposure to the volatility of interest rates  polyethylene and polypropylene resin prices  aluminum ingot and scrap prices  energy prices  foreign currencies and emerging markets 
see the section on liabilities  credit and long term obligations beginning on page regarding credit agreements and interest rate exposures 
changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices as well as natural gas prices natural gas is the principal energy source used to operate our casting furnaces 
there is no assurance of our ability to pass through higher raw material and energy costs to our customers 
we estimate that resin price increases in the fourth quarter of and resulted in a negative operating profit impact of about million and million  respectively  compared with the related third quarters of those years 
the significant increases in the us since in average quarterly prices of low density polyethylene resin a primary raw material for film products are shown in the chart below 
line graph source quarterly averages computed by tredegar using monthly data provided by chemical data inc cdi 
in january  cdi reflected a cents per pound non market adjustment based on their estimate of the growth of discounts over the to period 
the th quarter average rate of cents per pound is shown on a pro forma basis as if the non market adjustment was made in october resin prices in europe  asia and south america have exhibited similar trends 
the price of resin is driven by several factors including supply and demand and the price of oil  ethylene and natural gas 
to address fluctuating resin prices  we have pass through or cost sharing agreements covering about of our sales  but many have a day lag 
we have implemented price increases for customers that are currently not subject to pass through arrangements 
most new customer contracts contain resin pass through arrangements 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility see the chart below under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note on page for more information

in aluminum extrusions  we hedge from time to time a portion of our exposure to natural gas price volatility by entering into fixed price forward purchase contracts with our natural gas suppliers 
we estimate that  in an unhedged situation  every per mmbtu per month change in the market price of natural gas has a  impact on the monthly operating profit in aluminum extrusions 
substantially higher energy costs primarily natural gas in resulted in a reduction in operating profit in aluminum extrusions of approximately million in compared with in september  we announced an energy surcharge for our aluminum extrusions business in the us to be applied when the previous quarter s nymex natural gas average settlement price is in excess of per mmbtu

we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign operations and through exports from us plants 
the percentage of sales and total assets for manufacturing operations related to foreign markets for and are as follows tredegar corporation manufacturing operations percentage of net sales and total assets related to foreign markets of total net sales total assets foreign operations of total net sales total assets foreign operations exports from us foreign operations exports from us foreign operations canada europe latin america asia total exposure to foreign markets the percentages for foreign markets are relative to tredegar s total net sales and total assets from manufacturing operations consolidated net sales and total assets from continuing operations excluding cash and cash equivalents and afbs formerly therics 
we attempt to match the pricing and cost of our products in the same currency except in canada where about of our sales of aluminum extrusions are us dollar based and generally view the volatility of foreign currencies see trends for the euro  canadian dollar and hungarian forint in the chart below and emerging markets  and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flow  as part of the overall risk of operating in a global environment 
exports from the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
our foreign currency exposure on income from foreign operations relates to the canadian dollar  the euro  the hungarian forint  the chinese yuan and the brazilian real 
the relatively high percentage of us dollar priced sales in canada is partly due to the shifting of a large portion of the customers previously served by the aluminum extrusions plant in el campo  texas  in the resulting mismatch between the currency denomination of sales and costs causes lower us dollar translated profits when the canadian dollar appreciates since our costs are higher in us dollar equivalent terms while sales are mostly unaffected the opposite effect occurs when the canadian dollar depreciates in value relative to the us dollar 
we estimate that the appreciation of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar had an adverse impact on operating profit of about million in compared with  and million in compared with in film products  where we have been able to better match the currency of our sales and costs  we estimate that the appreciation of foreign currencies primarily the euro and hungarian forint and to a lesser extent the chinese yuan and brazilian real relative to the us dollar had a positive impact on operating profit of about  in compared with  and million in compared with we continue to review the loading of our aluminum extrusions plants in north america to optimize production mix and minimize cost in light of the increase in the us dollar equivalent cost structure of our plants in canada

film products net sales 
net sales in film products were million in  million in and million in the increases in net sales sales less freight in film products in the last two years is primarily due to growth in higher value added products  including apertured  elastic and surface protection materials  and higher selling prices  which were driven by the pass through of higher raw material costs 
total volume was million pounds in  million pounds in and million pounds in total volume related to the business in argentina sold in the third quarter of was million pounds in and million pounds in we estimate that the growth in net sales excluding the effects of the pass through of resin price changes  foreign exchange rate changes and divestitures was about in and in on february   we announced the expected shut down of the film products plant in lagrange  georgia 
the facility  which is operating at about the break even level  is expected to close by may  the plant had sales of commodity blown films of approximately million in operating profit 
operating profit from ongoing operations in film products was million in  million in and million in the improvement in over was due primarily to growth in higher value added products partially offset by higher resin costs 
we estimate that the adverse impact on operating profit of the lag in passing through higher resin costs net of the favorable effect of a decline in inventories accounted for under the last in first out method in the fourth quarter of compared with the third quarter of was approximately million 
fourth quarter operating profit was also adversely affected by the lag of passing through higher resin prices of around million compared with the third quarter of the decline in operating profit from ongoing operations in compared with was primarily due to higher resin costs and the loss of certain domestic backsheet business at the end of the first quarter of  partially offset by the positive effects of sales growth for new value added products

aluminum extrusions net sales and operating profit 
net sales in aluminum extrusions were million in  up from million in primarily due to higher selling prices driven by higher raw material and energy costs 
annual volume increased to million pounds in from million pounds in  as stronger shipments in commercial construction and hurricane protection products were offset by lower shipments in other end markets see our market segments in the table on page 
operating profit from ongoing operations declined to million in from million in due mainly to higher energy costs approximately million and strength of the canadian dollar about million  partially offset by price increases  higher volume and an energy surcharge 
the average costs for natural gas the principal energy source used to operate our casting furnaces  electricity and diesel fuel were significantly higher in compared with see the natural gas price chart on page
