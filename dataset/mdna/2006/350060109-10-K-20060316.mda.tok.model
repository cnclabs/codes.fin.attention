the company has concrete tie manufacturing facilities in both spokane  wa and grand island  ne  and is constructing a new facility in tucson  az where we expect to commence tie manufacturing late in the second quarter of the company also has two facilities that design  test and fabricate rail products in atlanta  ga and niles  oh 
the rail distribution business provides our customers with access to a variety of products including stick rail  continuous welded rail  specialty trackwork  power rail and various rail accessories 
this is a highly competitive business that  once specifications are met  depends heavily on pricing 
the company maintains relationships with several rail manufacturers but procures the majority of the rail it distributes from one supplier 
rail accessories are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers 

table of contents construction products the construction segment is comprised of the following business units piling  fabricated products  precast concrete wall retention systems geotechnical division and precast concrete buildings 
the piling division  via a sales force deployed throughout the united states  markets and sells piling worldwide 
this division offers its customers various types and dimensions of structural beam piling  sheet piling and pipe piling 
these piling products are sourced from various suppliers 
the company is the primary distributor of domestic beam and sheet piling for its primary supplier 
the fabricated products unit manufactures a number of fabricated steel and aluminum products primarily for the highway  bridge and transit industries including grid reinforced concrete deck and open steel grid flooring systems  guardrails  and expansion joints and heavy structural steel fabrications 
the geotechnical division engineers and supplies large mechanically stabilized earth retention projects mse walls and concrete soundwall systems primarily for highway construction projects 
although precasting of this product is usually outsourced to a qualified third party  the company does manufacture mse walls at its facilities in hillsboro  tx  spokane  wa and grand island  ne 
the company sold this business in february see recent developments  below 
the precast building unit manufactures concrete buildings primarily for national parks as well as numerous state and municipal park authorities 
this unit manufactures restrooms  concession stands and other protective storage buildings available in multiple designs  textures and colors 
the company believes it is the leading high end supplier in terms of volume  product options and capabilities 
the buildings are manufactured in spokane  wa and hillsboro  tx 
tubular products the tubular segment is comprised of two discrete business units  coated pipe and threaded products 
the coated pipe unit  located in birmingham  al  coats the outer dimension and  to a lesser extent  the inner dimension of pipe primarily for the oil and gas transmission industries 
coated pipe partners with its primary customer  a pipe manufacturer  to market fusion bonded epoxy coatings  abrasion resistant coatings and internal linings for a wide variety of pipe dimensions for pipeline projects throughout north america 
the threaded products unit  located in houston  tx  cuts  threads and paints pipe primarily for water well products for the agriculture industry and municipal water authorities

developments in may  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks 
the new agreement provided for a million five year revolving credit facility expiring in may in september  we amended this agreement to increase the credit line to million 
subsequent to the january completion of a concrete tie supply agreement with the union pacific railroad  we installed new tie manufacturing equipment in july at our refurbished facility in grand island  ne and commenced production of concrete ties in september 
certain of our businesses  especially our fabricated products group  have been hampered with low volumes and margins due to the delay in passing successor legislation to tea  which was a highway and transportation funding bill that expired in september in august  new legislation safetea lu was enacted authorizing billion for united states transportation improvement spending for the next four years 
we do not expect this new legislation to have a positive impact on the financial results of these businesses in in november  we purchased a  square foot facility in pueblo  co 
we plan to use this site to increase production capacity for our rail products businesses 
we will manufacture insulated rail joints that 
table of contents were previously outsourced to an exclusive supplier  and assemble electro lubricators at the new facility 
equipment installation and commissioning is expected to commence late in the first quarter of recent developments in january  we received the permitting necessary to begin construction on a concrete tie manufacturing facility in tucson  az 
construction began almost immediately after permitting 
the new plant will add further capacity to our existing facilities in grand island  ne and spokane  wa 
effective in february  northwest pipe company selected lb foster company as its north american distributor of spiral weld pipe piling 
this represents the first national agreement for northwest spiral weld pipe piling 
we will provide all sales and customer support for their spiral weld pipe piling product line and will provide an extensive network of locations to serve the market 
the federal surface transportation board stb issued its formal and final decision on february  which permits the dakota  minnesota eastern railroad dm e to construct a mile extension from its existing rail line into the powder river basin in wyoming and to rebuild approximately miles of its existing track 
we maintain a significant investment in the dm e 
please see dakota  minnesota eastern railroad in this management s discussion analysis for additional information 
in february  we sold assets related to our foster geotechnical division to the reinforced earth company for million plus the net asset value of the fixed assets  inventory  work in progress and prepaid items 
the company anticipates realizing a net gain of approximately million from this transaction 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period  because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas whereby goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are subject to annual impairment tests 
the impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step  which is used to identify potential impairment only  compares the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with its carrying value 
since quoted market prices are not readily available for the company s reporting units  the company estimates fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying 
table of contents amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the process is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment testing must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
step two requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of goodwill  impairment must be recorded 
the company believes that the accounting estimates used in this testing are critical accounting estimates because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period affecting the fair value calculation which may have a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions require significant judgments related to anticipated revenues  and other internal and external economic conditions such as growth rate  discount rate and inflation 
at december  and  the goodwill on the company s balance sheet was million 
allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific customers is reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that customer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december  and  the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million 
product liability the company maintains a current liability for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  a nominal accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction products  a liability is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the company believes that this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to calculate the liability can change from period to period 
at december  and  the product liability was million and million  respectively 
slow moving inventory the company maintains reserves for slow moving inventory 
these reserves  which are reviewed and adjusted routinely  take into account numerous factors such as quantities on hand versus turnover  product knowledge  and physical inventory observations 
the company believes this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used in calculating the reserve can change from period to period and could have a material impact on the income statement 
at december  and  the reserve for slow moving inventory was million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenues from long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of actual direct labor costs to estimated total direct labor costs 
as certain contracts extend over one or more years  revisions to estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  the company s estimates of total costs and costs to complete have reasonably approximated actual costs incurred to complete contracts 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the financial statements 
the company estimates the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
the company believes these 
table of contents estimates are critical accounting estimates because they require the use of judgments due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process 
as a result  actual revenues and profits could differ materially from estimates 
pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in a different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company for and was 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  sfas requires that the company look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in the assumed discount rate has the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the assumed discount rate used by the company was and for and  respectively 
deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
sfas requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 
see note  income taxes 
the company s ability to realize these tax benefits may affect the company s reported income tax expense benefit and net income loss 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows sfas 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
disclosure of the effect of expensing the fair value of equity compensation is currently required under existing literature 
the statement also requires the tax benefit associated with these share based payments be classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flows rather then operating activities as currently permitted 
in april  the sec delayed the effective date of this statement until the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the company will begin recording compensation expense 
table of contents utilizing the modified prospective application in its first quarter financial statements 
based solely on unvested awards at december   the company projects compensation expense will be million  net of tax 
in october  president bush signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through when fully phased in  this deduction will be equal to percent of the lesser of a qualified production activities income qpai  as defined in the act  or b taxable income after utilization of any net operating loss carryforwards 
in all cases  the deduction is limited to percent of w wages of the taxpayer 
in return  the act also provides for a two year phase out except for certain pre existing binding contracts of the existing extraterritorial income exclusion eti benefit for foreign sales that the world trade organization wto ruled was an illegal export subsidy 
in december  fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  application of fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  to the deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  was issued 
fsp no 
clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
as such  the special deduction had no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the date of enactment 
in addition  due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  the deduction has no effect on taxes 
in march  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
this interpretation provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets when the timing and or method of settlement of the obligation is conditional on a future event 
this interpretation requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
adoption of this interpretation did not affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the completion of the refurbishment and the extension of the lease of the grand island  ne facility  sufficient information was available for the company to estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation associated with the leased property 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a liability  using the expected present value technique within the interpretation  for conditional asset retirement obligations of approximately million

in june  the dm e announced its plan to build an extension from the dm e s existing line into the low sulfur coal market of the powder river basin in wyoming and to rebuild approximately miles of its existing track the project 
the estimated cost of this project is expected to be in excess of billion 
the surface transportation board stb approved the project in january in october  however  the th us circuit court of appeals remanded the matter to the stb and instructed the stb to address  in its environmental impact statement  the project s effects on air quality  noise and vibration  and preservation of historic sites 
on january   the th us circuit court of appeals denied petitions seeking a rehearing of the case 
on april   the stb issued a draft supplemental environmental impact statement seis on the project 
on february   after reviewing public comments on the seis  the stb made its final decision  approving the project 
if the project proves to be viable  management believes that the value of the company s investment in the dm e could increase significantly 
if the project does not come to fruition  management believes that the value of the company s investment is supported by the dm e s existing business 
in december  the dm e received a railroad rehabilitation and improvement financing rrif loan in the amount of million from the federal railroad administration 
funding provided by the year loan was used to refinance debt and upgrade infrastructure along parts of its existing route 
in november   the dm e announced that it has applied for a federal railroad administration fra loan package totaling approximately billion to build and rehabilitate approximately  miles of railroad in four states 
the loan package is intended to fund four separate projects  including a mile project which encompasses the project 
outlook our cxt rail operation and allegheny rail products division are dependent on a class i railroad for a significant portion of their business 
in january  the cxt rail operation was awarded a long term contract from this class i railroad for the supply of prestressed concrete railroad ties 
the class i railroad has agreed to purchase ties from the grand island facility through december  and the tucson  az facility through december see developments and recent developments for more details regarding the contract and these facilities 
in  our primary supplier of sheet piling provided significantly larger amounts of sheet piling than in previous years  and also expanded the number of sections it provided 
although there are still some sections that remain unavailable and are necessary for us to compete effectively in the structural steel market  management s outlook is positive considering developments 

table of contents although backlog is not necessarily indicative of future operating results  total company backlog at december  was approximately million 
the following table provides the backlog by business segment december  in thousands backlog rail products construction products tubular products total backlog at december   and the construction products segment backlog included approximately million  million  and million  respectively  related to the company s geotechnical division 
in february  assets related to this division were sold 
see note  subsequent event for details about the transaction 
we continue to evaluate the overall performance of our operations 
a decision to down size or terminate an existing operation could have a material adverse effect on near term earnings but would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
forward looking statements statements relating to the potential value of the dm e or the project  or management s belief as to such matters  are forward looking statements and are subject to numerous contingencies and risk factors 
the company has based its assessment on information provided by the dm e and has not independently verified such information 
in addition to matters mentioned above  factors which can adversely affect the value of the dm e and its ability to complete the project include the following labor disputes  the outcome of certain litigation  any inability to obtain necessary environmental and government approvals for the project in a timely fashion  the dm e s ability to continue to obtain interim funding to finance the project  the expense of environmental mitigation measures required by the surface transportation board  an inability to obtain financing for the project  competitors response to the project  market demand for coal or electricity and changes in environmental laws and regulations 
an inability to produce a full complement of piling products by a virginia steel mill could adversely impact the growth of the piling division 
delays or problems encountered at our concrete tie facilities during construction or implementation could have a material  negative impact on the company s operating results  including delays or problems obtaining permits 
the company s businesses could be affected adversely by significant change in the price of steel  concrete or other raw materials 
a substantial portion of the company s operations is heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects 
significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on the operating results of the company
