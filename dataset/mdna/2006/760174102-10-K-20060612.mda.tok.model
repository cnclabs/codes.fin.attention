item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business trends effective april   we implemented a new corporate structure  which includes separate pay per transaction ppt and advanced media and information ami operating divisions and  accordingly  we are now reporting certain financial information by individual segment under this new structure 
our ppt division focuses on managing our business operations that facilitate the delivery of home entertainment content products dvds  vhss  video games  etc 
and related rental and sales information for the content to home video specialty stores and other retailers  on a revenue sharing basis 
we lease product from various suppliers  typically motion picture studios 
under our ppt system  retailers sublease that product from us and rent it to consumers 
retailers then share a portion of each retail rental transaction with us and the studio 
since we collect  process and analyze rental and sales information at the title level  we report that information to both the studio and the respective retailers 
our ami division concentrates on the management and growth of our essentials suite of business intelligence services  which are no longer in the development stage  as well as operating our direct revenue sharing drs services 
our essentials suite software and services  offered on a recurring subscription basis  provide unique data collection  management  analysis and reporting functions  resulting in business intelligence information valuable to our clients 
our drs services collect  track  audit and report the results to our suppliers under established agreements on a fee for service basis 
the ppt division the financial results from the ppt division continue to be affected by the changing dynamics in the home video and game rental market 
this market is highly competitive and influenced greatly by consumer spending patterns and behaviors 
the end consumer has a wide variety of choices from which to select their entertainment content 
some examples include renting units of product from our participating retailers  ordering product direct via online subscriptions and or online distributors  subscribing to at home movie channels  purchasing and owning the unit directly or selecting an at home pay per view option 
our ppt system focuses on the traditional brick and mortar retailer 
we believe that our system successfully addresses the many choices available to consumers and enables our participating retailers the opportunity to stock their stores with a wider selection of titles and a greater supply of popular box office releases 
most of our arrangements are structured so that most participating retailers pay minimal upfront fees and lower per transaction fees in exchange for ordering all units offered by a particular program supplier referred to as output programs 
since these programs usually result in more overall units rented  our retailers revenue and the corresponding share with the studios have increased 
these programs are  in part  an economic response to the changing dynamics of the home video rental market 
we expect the growth of these output programs to continue  and believe that they will be financially beneficial for the participating retailers  program suppliers and us 
our base of participating retailers continues to be strong 
we had one participating retailer that accounted for million  or approximately  of total revenues in fiscal and million  or approximately  of total revenues in fiscal our agreement with this participating retailer expired in september and we have not received  nor do we expect to receive  any appreciable revenue from this participating retailer in fiscal or future periods 
we are implementing strategies to obtain new participating retailers and program suppliers in an effort to further stabilize and grow our overall ppt revenue and earnings streams 
we continue to be in good standing with all of our program suppliers and we make on going efforts to enhance those business relationships through improvement of current services offered and the development of new service offerings 
we are also continually seeking to develop business relationships with new program suppliers 
in september  we entered into a combined dvd vhs revenue sharing program with one of the world s largest studios that has resulted in their becoming our largest program supplier representing  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the percentage decrease in total revenues related to this program supplier was primarily due to the loss of the major participating retailer noted above 
also  in november   based on our successful involvement with another major studio in canada  we entered into a revenue sharing agreement which extends product offerings to participating retailers in the united states 
this agreement was effective for titles released beginning in january this will allow our us participating retailers access to the large volume of high quality entertainment that this major studio has continued to deliver year after year 
additional program suppliers represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal as is typical of our agreements with program suppliers  our relationships with these program suppliers may be terminated without cause upon thirty days written notice by either party 
ami and other divisions we are also allocating significant resources towards our business intelligence service offerings  both those services that are currently operational as well as those that are in various stages of development 
our suite of business intelligence services has been well received in the various targeted markets to date  as our offerings fit well with the needs identified by those market participants 
our box office essentials and home video essentials business intelligence service offerings  which are fully operational and no longer in significant stages of development  saw revenue increases of and  respectively  during fiscal compared to fiscal we intend to continue to invest in our existing  as well as new  business intelligence services in the near term as we expand the markets we serve and our service lines  which likely will lower our earnings 
longer term  we believe these services will provide significant future revenue and earnings streams and contribute to our overall success

we completed this asset sale transaction effective july   and received the cash purchase price in full 
the operations of pf have not been reported as discontinued operations in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  because cash flows related to our fulfillment activities have not been completely eliminated

due to the timing of the notification  we were not able to include the columbus  ohio distribution facility lease in the asset sale transaction

discontinued operations discontinued operations include the operations of blowout video  which consisted of retail store operations for the sale of used units 
due to the significant increase in sell through activity throughout the industry  the operations of blowout video did not meet our expectations  and  as a result  during fiscal  we initiated and completed a plan to discontinue the retail store operations of blowout video 
the plan called for an exit from the stores by the end of fiscal  either through cancellation of the lease commitments and liquidation of assets  or through sale of the stores to a third party 
as of march   all operations had ceased 
in january  we were notified by the purchaser of a portion of blowout video s operations of their intent to default on a note receivable due to us

contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of march  was as follows in thousands payments due by fiscal period contractual obligation total and and and beyond operating leases program supplier guarantees critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policies  for additional information 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable by monitoring past due balances 
if it is determined that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is established based on the amount we expect to recover 
an additional general reserve is provided based on aging of accounts receivable and our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change related to specific customers  overall aging of accounts receivable or collection experience  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could materially change 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  and  respectively  at march  and program supplier reserves we have entered into guarantee contracts with certain program suppliers providing titles for distribution under our ppt system 
these contracts guarantee the program suppliers minimum payments per unit shipped that are recoupable based on revenue sharing activity 
in some cases  these guarantees are paid in advance 
for amounts not paid in advance  we record a liability for the gross amount of the guarantee due to the program supplier on the street date in accordance with statement of position  accounting by producers or distributors of films sop 
for guarantees paid in advance  the unearned portion of the guarantees is included as advances to program suppliers on our consolidated balance sheets 
using historical experience and year to date rental experience for each title  we estimate the projected revenue to be generated under each guarantee 
we have historically been able to reasonably estimate shortages after to days of rental activity 
we then establish a program supplier reserve for titles that are projected to experience a shortage under the provisions of the guarantee 
the program supplier reserve is netted against advances to program suppliers on our consolidated balance sheets 
we continually review these factors and make adjustments to the reserves as needed 
actual results could differ from these estimates and could have a material effect on the recorded program supplier reserves 
the balance in this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  at march  and deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets arise from the tax benefit of amounts expensed for financial reporting purposes but not yet deducted for tax purposes and from unutilized tax credits and nol carry forwards 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
to the extent it is determined the recoverability of the deferred tax assets is unlikely  we will record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
as of march  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against our canadian net operating loss carryforwards 
net deferred tax assets totaled million and million  respectively  as of march  and new accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting pronouncements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than disclosed above under contractual payment obligations  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at march  a review of our other financial instruments and risk exposures at march  revealed that we had exposure to interest rate risk related to our cash deposits and marketable securities 
we utilized sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of this risk and concluded that near term changes in interest rates should not materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
