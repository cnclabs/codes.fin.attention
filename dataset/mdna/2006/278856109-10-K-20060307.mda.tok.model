table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this document 
eclipsys is a healthcare information technology company 
we develop and license our proprietary software and content to hospitals 
our software allows hospitals to automate many of the key clinical  administrative and financial functions that they require 
our software is designed to enable our clients to improve patient care and patient satisfaction  and allow them to reduce their operating costs and enhance their revenues 
our content provides practice guidelines for use in clinical environments 
background we were founded in december to commercialize an integrated clinical and financial information software system for use by hospitals 
historically  hospitals kept records in paper form 
this has been associated with patient safety concerns  including avoidable medical errors  duplicative and unnecessary procedures  inefficient use of limited resources  and a limited ability to track  bill and collect for services rendered 
our software is designed to address these issues by turning data into information that can be easily used  accessed by or provided to the right person  at the right time  in the right place 
this enables hospital employees to redesign business processes  deliver higher quality care at lower cost  and receive expedited payment for services rendered 
our software also helps to improve collaboration among physicians  nurses and other healthcare workers across all venues of care 
software development in june  we began re expressing the intellectual property we had acquired through acquisitions on a common platform to provide integrated software to our clients 
in  we announced the general availability of scm  the first version of our sunrise tm suite of software 
scm provides advanced knowledge based clinical decision support capabilities including computerized physician order entry 
in  we announced our sunrisexa tm strategy 
this strategy was to migrate our sunrise suite of software to an open architecture and platform 
sunrisexa s architecture is built on microsoft s 
net framework  microsoft sql server and the microsoft windows family of operating systems 
in and  we announced the general availability of certain components of our sunrisexa software offerings 
in october  we identified and announced certain response time issues within components of the version of our next generation clinical software that we were developing at that time 
although some of our software components had been implemented in and were working at some client sites  we determined that the software did not produce acceptable response times for complex  high volume hospital environments 
to address the issue  we implemented a strategy that was designed to allow sunrisexa clients to continue their deployment of sunrisexa  and at the same time allow us to continue the development of advanced sunrisexa solutions 
this strategy was to replace the affected sunrisexa components with certain components from our scm software  which is our prior generation  core clinical software 
the response time issue resulted in a software delivery delay for some of our advanced sunrisexa functionality 
the announcement of these issues also impacted the implementation schedules for a number of our clients 
this announcement adversely affected our sales in and in connection with this issue  we recorded a million write down of capitalized software development costs to net realizable value for some sunrisexa components in the third quarter of the write down was included in the costs of systems and services revenues 
also  we believe that the correction of the response time issue and related issues is covered by the warranties that we provide to our clients 
we intend to continue to remediate the problem for our clients 
accordingly  we recorded provisions related to warranty costs of million to date 
these provisions reflect our estimate of warranty related costs that includes among other things  implementation and third party costs for affected clients 
warranty costs are charged to costs of systems and services revenues when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
through december   we had expended approximately million in warranty costs related to remediation of the response time issue and related issues 
as of december  the warranty reserve balance was million 
professional services revenues have been  and we believe will continue to be negatively affected as we utilize resources to fulfill these obligations 
on june   we introduced sunrise clinical manager release xa 
this new release contained significant additional functionality for core clinical  ambulatory and emergency department settings  as well as enhancements to patient management functions 
additionally  the new release extended support for physicians through the inclusion of advanced functionality for clinical decision support  structured notes  medical necessity checking  prescription writing and medical management configuration 
in november  we announced the general availability of sunrise ed manager xa and sunrise ambulatory care manager xa 
in the first quarter of  we released sunrise clinical manager release xa  which contained new features and enhancements in several key areas including incremental functionality related to ambulatory  emergency department  critical care  medication management and nursing 
additionally  we released remote access services ras xa tm and pocket sunrise tm xa  which enhanced users ability to access our applications from remote locations 
furthermore  in november we announced the release of sunrise radiology information system ris  which automates radiology workflow 
in january we released sunrise clinical manager release xa 
this release contained approximately  incremental functions which continued to enhance the capabilities of our offering in all major clinical areas including ambulatory  emergency department  critical care and nursing 
additionally  this release included integrated end to end medication management capabilities and builds upon recent enhancements to our sunrise patient financial manager and sunrise decision support manager solutions 
the general availability of these releases fulfilled key deliverables expected by our clients in connection with the response time issue 
these releases were consistent with our strategy and contained enhanced functionality as planned 
operational initiatives during  our management made two strategic decisions that significantly impacted our operating results 
first  we substantially increased our gross research and development spending  which includes research and development expenses and capitalized software development costs 
this decision was made to enable us to bring components of our sunrisexa software line to market more rapidly 
second  we invested heavily in sales and marketing to enhance market awareness surrounding eclipsys and its software and services 
we did this to capitalize on perceived market demand for our software and services 
additionally  in  we moved aggressively to change our contracting model  offering our clients payment terms which are more evenly distributed over the term of the contract compared to our historical licensing model  in which software license fees were paid in advance 
we did this to meet the needs of our clients  by matching the timing of their payments to the value that we deliver to them 
we believe that this new contracting model makes purchase decisions easier for our clients 
the change in our contracting model has had a material affect on our revenues  gross margins  and cash flows 
because the payments from our clients for software license fees are more evenly distributed over the term of the contract  our revenues are recognized over a longer period of time compared to our historical licensing model  while a significant portion of our operating expenses remain relatively fixed  resulting in lower margins early in the contract term 
we believe that this contracting model will provide for more predictable revenues on a year over year basis  and that over time  our margins will trend back towards historical levels as revenue from contracts later in their contract term help to compensate for lower margins earned in connection with new contracts 
competitive environment and other challenges for during the fourth quarter of and much of  we experienced a slow down in closing new sales transactions related to increasing competition  issues associated with our previously discussed software delay and our ceo transition 
additionally  we hired a new ceo during the fourth quarter of and implemented a restructuring of senior management and our operations during january also  we continue to release significant new functionality in our software suite including a major new release in january in connection with these releases  we continue to implement a significant number of clients on this new software 
in the event our new software does not continue to achieve market acceptance  we experience any significant delays in implementing these new releases or experience disruptions in our operations as a result of the restructuring activities  our results of operations could be negatively affected  including a delay or loss in closing future new sales transactions 
critical accounting policies we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates and adjusts its estimates and judgments  if necessary 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software development costs and our warranty reserve 
please refer to note of the audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we generally contract under multiple element arrangements  which include software license fees  hardware and services including consulting  implementation  and software maintenance  for periods of to years 
we evaluate revenue recognition on a contract by contract basis as the terms of each arrangement vary 
the evaluation of our contractual arrangements often requires judgments and estimates that affect the timing of revenue recognized in our statements of operations 
specifically  we may be required to make judgments about whether the fees associated with our software and services are fixed or determinable  whether collection of our fees is reasonably assured  whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the related software  whether we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates in the application of the percentage of completion method  and whether we have verifiable objective evidence of fair value for our software and services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 staff accounting bulletin  or sab   revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  or eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sop and sab  as amended  require among other matters  that there be a signed contract evidencing an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
many of our contracts with our clients are multiple element arrangements which may provide for multiple software modules including the rights to future versions and releases we may offer within the software suites the client purchases or rights to software versions that support different hardware or operating platforms  and that do not qualify as exchange rights 
we refer to these arrangements as subscription contracts 
additionally  we sometimes enter into multiple element arrangements that do not include these rights to future software or platform protection rights 
we refer to these arrangements as traditional software contracts 
finally  we offer much of our software and services on a stand alone bases 
revenue under each of these arrangements is recognized as follows subscription contracts our subscription contracts typically include the following deliverables software license fees  maintenance  professional services  and third party hardware or remote hosting services 
software license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  commencing upon the delivery of the software provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of our fee is considered probable 
the value of the software is determined using the residual method pursuant to statement of position or sop  modification of sop  with respect to certain transactions or sop these contracts contain the rights to unspecified future software within the suite purchased and or unspecified platform transfer rights that do not qualify for exchange accounting 
accordingly  these arrangements are accounted for pursuant to paragraphs and of sop software revenue recognition or sop under certain arrangements  we capitalize related direct costs consisting of third party software costs and direct software implementation costs 
these costs are amortized over the term of the arrangement 
in the case of maintenance revenues  vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe of fair value is based on substantive renewal prices  and the revenues are recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
in the case of professional services revenues  vsoe is based on prices from stand alone sale transactions  and the revenues are recognized as services are performed pursuant to paragraph of sop third party hardware revenues are recognized upon delivery  pursuant to sab in the case of remote hosting services  vsoe is based upon consistent pricing charged to clients based on volumes and performance requirements on a stand alone basis and substantive renewal terms  and the revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term as the services are performed 
our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one time set up activities and include a one time set up fee 
this one time set up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution 
we have determined that these set up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting  and accordingly the related set up fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
we consider the applicability of eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  to our remote hosting services arrangements on a contract by contract basis 
if we determine that the client has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty  and can feasibly run the software on its own hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software  a software element covered by sop exists 
when a software element exists in a remote hosting services arrangement  we recognize the license  professional services and remote hosting services revenues pursuant to sop  whereby the fair value of the remote hosting service is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract 
if we determine that a software element covered by sop is not present in a remote hosting services arrangement  we recognize revenue for the remote hosting services arrangement  ratably over the term of the remote hosting contract pursuant to sab 
table of contents traditional software contracts we enter into traditional multiple element arrangements that include the following elements software license  maintenance  professional services  and third party hardware or remote hosting services 
revenue for each of the elements is recognized as follows software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the software provided that there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of our fee is considered probable 
for those arrangements in which the fee is not considered fixed or determinable  the software license revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
for arrangements where vsoe only exists for the undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements software license revenue using the residual method in accordance with sop in addition to the software license fees  these contracts may also contain maintenance  professional services and hardware or remote hosting services 
vsoe and revenue recognition for these elements is determined using the same methodology as noted above for subscription contracts 
software contracts requiring contract accounting we enter into certain multiple element arrangements containing milestone provisions in which the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
under these arrangements  software license fees and professional service revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method over the implementation period which generally ranges from to months 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the implementation based upon estimates of total labor hours incurred and revenues to be generated over the term of the implementation 
changes in estimates of total labor hours and the related effect on the timing of revenues and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
accordingly  changes in these estimates could occur and have a material effect on our operating results in the period of change 
stand alone software and service we also market certain software and services on a stand alone basis  including the following outsourcing  software license  maintenance  professional services  hardware  network services  remote hosting services 
revenues related to such software and services are recognized as follows software license fees and maintenance are marketed on a stand alone basis may be licensed either under traditional contracts or under subscription arrangements 
software license fees under traditional contracts are recognized pursuant to sop upon delivery of the software  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
under subscription agreements for stand alone software  license fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
with respect to maintenance  vsoe is determined based on substantive renewal prices contained in the contracts 
maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
professional services represent incremental services marketed to clients including implementation and consulting services 
professional services revenues  where vsoe is based on prices from stand alone transactions are recognized as services are performed 
hardware is recognized upon delivery pursuant to sab network service arrangements include the assessment  assembly and delivery of a wireless network which may include wireless carts or other wireless equipment to the client 
our network services arrangements are sold to a client for a fixed fee 
all services are performed prior to the delivery of the equipment 
these contracts are typically to days in length and are recognized pursuant to sab  upon the delivery of the network to the client 
remote hosting contracts that are sold on a stand alone basis are recognized ratably over the contract term pursuant to sab our remote hosting arrangements generally require us to perform one time set up activities and include a one time set up fee 
this one time set up fee is generally paid by the client at contract execution 
we have determined that these set up activities do not constitute a separate unit of accounting  and accordingly we recognize the related set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
we provide outsourcing services to our clients 
under these arrangements we assume all responsibilities for a healthcare organization s it operations using our employees 
our outsourcing services include facilities management  network outsourcing and transition management 
these arrangements typically range from five to ten years in duration 
revenues from these arrangements are recognized when services are performed 

table of contents we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses in both systems and services revenues and as a direct cost of systems and services revenues in accordance with eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf 
eitf requires reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred to be characterized as revenue in the statement of operations 
for   and reimbursable out of pocket expenses were million  million  and million  respectively 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees  we have classified the re imbursement by clients of shipping and handling costs as revenue and the associated cost as cost of revenue 
if other judgments or assumptions were used in the evaluation of our revenue arrangements  the timing and amounts of revenue recognized may have been significantly different 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific client s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from clients 
if circumstances related to specific clients change  or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize software development costs in accordance with fasb statement no 
accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize software development costs incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of the software being developed 
these costs include salaries  benefits  consulting and other directly related costs incurred in connection with coding and testing software 
capitalization ceases when the software is generally released for sale to clients  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
at each balance sheet date  we perform a detailed assessment of our capitalized software development costs which includes a review of  among other factors  projected revenues  client demand requirements  software lifecycle  changes in software and hardware technologies  and software development plans 
based on this analysis we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect the net realizable value of our capitalized software development costs 
the estimates of expected future revenues generated by the software  the remaining economic life of the software  or both  could change  materially affecting the carrying value of capitalized software development costs  as well as our consolidated operating results in the period of change 
on october   we announced response time issues with some components of the version of our next generation core clinical software that we were developing at that time 
to address the issue  we implemented a strategy that was designed to allow sunrisexa clients to continue their deployment of sunrisexa  and at the same time allow us to continue the development of our advanced sunrisexa solutions 
our strategy was to replace the affected sunrisexa components with certain components from our scm software 
as a result  in we recorded a million write down of capitalized software development costs for certain sunrisexa components to net realizable value 
the write down is included in the costs of systems and services revenues 
warranty reserve the agreements that we use to license our software include a limited warranty providing that our software  in its unaltered form  will perform substantially in accordance with the related documentation 
through september   we did not incur any material warranty costs related to our software 
due to the response time issues that we identified in october  we recorded provisions related to warranty costs of million to date and expended million against the provision through december  warranty costs are charged to costs of systems and services revenues when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
in determining this warranty reserve  we used significant judgments and estimates for the additional professional service hours and third party costs that will be necessary to remedy this issue on a client by client basis 
the timing and amount of our warranty reserve could have been different if we had used other judgments or assumptions in our evaluation 
we expect to substantially complete this work by december  results of operations revenues we derive revenues from licensing our software and the delivery of services including software and hardware maintenance  professional services including implementation  integration  training and consulting  remote hosting services  outsourcing services  network services  and the sale of computer hardware 
our software and services are generally sold to clients under contracts that range in duration from to years 
costs of revenues the principal costs of systems and services revenues are salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for implementation  maintenance  remote hosting and outsourcing personnel 
other significant costs are the amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired technology intangible asset 
capitalized software development costs are generally amortized over three years on a straight line basis commencing upon general release of the related software  or are based on the ratio that current revenues bear to total anticipated revenues for the applicable software 
acquired technology is amortized over three to five years based upon the estimated economic life of the underlying asset 
cost of revenues related to hardware sales includes our cost to acquire the hardware from the manufacturer 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a write down of capitalized software costs to net realizable value of certain components of our sunrisexa software in the amount of million 
this related to the sunrisexa response time issue discussed above 
additionally  to date  we have recorded a warranty provision of million related to anticipated costs of our sunrisexa response time issue 
this warranty provision reflects an estimate of implementation and third party costs for certain clients 
the warranty provision was included in the costs of systems and services revenues 

table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  commissions  and related overhead costs 
other costs include expenditures for marketing programs and events  public relations  trade shows  advertising  and related communications 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead  as well as consultants for the design  development and testing of new software 
we capitalize certain software development costs subsequent to attaining technological feasibility 
these costs are amortized as an element of the costs of systems and services revenues 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related overhead costs for administration  executive  finance  legal  human resources  purchasing and internal systems personnel  as well as accounting and legal fees and expenses 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate the costs of our tangible capital assets on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which generally range from to years  and may reach years for outsourcing contracts 
acquisition related intangible assets  which primarily consisted of the value of ongoing client relationships  acquired technology and goodwill  have been amortized based upon their estimated economic lives at the time of the acquisition  and vary among acquisitions 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 our amortization of goodwill ceased as of january   leaving a recorded balance of  for goodwill as of december  on at least an annual basis  we conduct an impairment review of our goodwill balance 
as of december   there was no impairment of the goodwill balance 
taxes as of december   we had us net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of million 
of this amount  million expires in with the balance expiring in varying amounts annually through of the million total  million relate to stock option tax deductions which will be tax effected and the benefit credited as additional paid in capital when realized 
additionally  the company has canadian foreign net operating loss carryovers of million that expire in varying amounts through we did not record a benefit for the resulting net deferred tax asset for any of the periods presented  because we believe it is more likely than not that we would not realize our net deferred tax asset 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax asset 
we are required to reverse the valuation allowance and record a benefit for the net deferred tax asset if and to the extent that we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the asset 
this will result in a non recurring benefit in the period that we make the determination 
for all future periods  after the recognition of the non recurring benefit  we will record income tax expense in any period in which we earn taxable income

these revenues increased million or to million in from million in additionally  professional services revenues which include implementation  integration  consulting and training services increased million or to million in from million in also  revenue related to software and networking services increased million or to million in compared to million in increases in ratable generated revenues were primarily driven by increases in outsourcing  remote hosting and subscription revenues which include software maintenance 
the increase in outsourcing revenues was primarily the result of revenues associated with a large contract entered into in q remote hosting revenues were favorably impacted by a shift in sales mix as more clients began to elect this option in lieu of purchasing hardware as a mechanism to deliver their software applications 
we expect that remote hosting will continue to expand as a delivery option in future periods 
subscription revenues increased as a result of progress made on a significant number of client implementations during the past twelve months as our clients continue to activate our clinical and financial modules 
these activations resulted in higher revenues under these contracts 
additionally  new sales bookings in and favorably impacted subscription related revenues 
revenues related to software and networking services increased million in compared to the prior year 
networking services increased million to million in compared to million in these increases were related to higher sales volume 
software related revenues increased million to million in this increase was primarily driven by an increase in third party related software revenues which increased from million in to million in other software related revenues  which includes revenues recognized upon delivery of our software and content sold directly by us or through third parties  increased from million in to million in  these revenues can vary significantly from period to period and past levels are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
other software related revenues increased primarily as a result of a higher volume of revenues related to sales of our clinical practice content under a remarketing arrangement with a third party 
there is no assurance that we will generate comparable amounts under this arrangement in future periods 
the increase in third party software was a result of higher software sales in in the event that we are not successful in achieving comparable levels of software related revenues in  our operating results could be negatively impacted 
professional service revenues increased as a result of major activation activities at numerous client installations during additionally  we experienced significant growth in our consulting practice as clients have begun to acquire these services from us to improve their respective work flow and processes associated with their ongoing operations 
in  new sales levels associated with consulting and implementation services have significantly increased as clients have purchased higher volumes of these offerings to improve their workflows and benefits derived from using our software 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
hardware revenues decreased approximately million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million in the decrease was a result of lower software related sales in and the first half of associated with the previously discussed software issue 
additionally  we have begun to experience a change in sales mix as more clients have elected remote hosting services in lieu of hardware purchases to operate their respective software applications 
we expect hardware and network service transactions will fluctuate in future periods due a variety of factors  including competition within the hardware industry  the status of the client implementations and future sales volumes related to hardware and network services 

table of contents revenue increases in any period are attributable  to a significant degree  to sales contracts entered into in prior years 
because software sales bookings have fallen short of our expectations  the percentage revenue increases experienced in may not be repeated in cost of systems and services revenues exclusive of depreciation shown below  increased approximately million or to million  for the year ended december  compared to million in the increase in costs of systems and services revenues in was related to the following higher payroll related costs associated with an increase in outsourcing  higher costs associated with incremental remote hosting revenue  higher amortization of capitalized software development costs associated with the release of sunrise clinical manager xa in june and xa in march  higher costs associated with a higher volume networking services revenues  higher costs associated with an increase in third party related software revenues  higher implementation costs associated with an expanded implementation team in connection with higher professional services volumes and an increased usage of third party consultants to augment these services  during  we experienced a significant increase in costs associated with the use of third party consultants to augment our implementation services 
in q  we implemented an initiative to improve our professional services area which included a reorganization of these resources 
additionally  we are investing incremental resources in training related activities and improvements in our services infrastructure 
we expect these initiatives to improve our results in this area over the next months 
cost of hardware revenues decreased million to million or in compared to million in the decrease in these costs was directly related to the lower hardware volumes discussed above 
the gross margin percentage on hardware revenue decreased to in compared to in research and development expenses were million in compared to million in gross research and development spending which consists of research and development expense plus capitalized software development costs decreased million to million in compared to million in the decrease in overall spending was driven by an improvement in internal processes within the research and development organization and a shifting of resources from third party consultants to internal resources 
in summary  research and development was as follows in thousands change change research and development expenses capitalized software development costs gross research and development expenses amortization of capitalized software development costs the increase in amortization of capitalized software development costs was a result of the release of sunrise clinical manager xa in june and sunrise clinical manager xa in march these costs are included as a component of costs of systems and services revenues 
we expect capitalization of software development costs to reduce in from levels 
sunrise clinical manager xa and xa  which accounted for a significant part of our software development expense in  have been released  and software development in is expected to focus more on enhancement and maintenance of existing software than on new software development 
the anticipated reduction in software development capitalization will result in a commensurate increase in research and development expense recognized in general and administrative expenses increased approximately million or to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily related to costs associated with the transition of our ceo resulting in incremental costs of million 
additionally  costs increased as a result of an incremental investment in our infrastructure related to the expansion of our management team and an increase in costs associated with incentive related compensation 
these increases were partially offset by lower legal costs and a reduction in insurance related expenses 
in and beyond  recorded expenses will increase as a result of our adoption of fas r  which requires us to record expense associated with stock options based upon their fair value at the date of grant 
if we had adopted this methodology we would have recorded stock option related expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively using the black scholes valuation model 
actual amounts recorded in the future will vary depending upon the number of options actually granted  the fair market value at the date of grant  and other variables affecting the calculation 
depreciation and amortization increased million or to million in compared to million in the increase was a result of an on going investment in our infrastructure in research and development area and other areas of the company 
the increase was also attributable to a full year of amortization for acquired intangible assets in the current year compared to a pro rated period in the prior year 
interest income increased million to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily related to better yields earned on cash and cash equivalent balances in as a result of these factors  we had a net income of  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december

the higher sales volume was related to success in the market place in connection with sales of our advanced clinical systems and combined software and outsourcing transactions 
the sales of advanced clinical systems were related to ongoing industry wide initiatives to adopt and implement these systems 
in connection with the higher sales volume  we began to market multiple element arrangements that are recognized on a monthly basis 
this initiative which was implemented in  has resulted in lower cash flows during the past two years as these contracts provide for payment terms that provide for lower cash flows during the early portion of the respective contracts 
the growth in professional services was a result of significant incremental activity in tied to client implementations 
activities increased in as numerous clients went live on one or more software applications 
this activity is expected to continue at these heightened levels in as numerous clients are scheduled to activate or upgrade their software applications 
the increase in software license revenues and network services revenues was primarily a result of higher network services revenues which increased by million in network services revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was a result of an initiative we implemented to expand our network services offering to our client base 
as part of our future growth and continued expansion of our solutions offering  we implemented a strategy to market combined outsourcing and software contracts 
we signed several large contracts in this area in and continued this program in in the event that we experience a change in revenue mix whereby a higher portion of contracts are combined outsourcing and software contracts  our overall gross margin percentage would likely decline 
however  given the significantly larger size of typical combined outsourcing and software contracts  we expect the overall contribution of these contracts to our profitability would be positive

the gross margin percentage on hardware revenue decreased to in compared to in the decrease was a result of pricing pressures in in the hardware sector of our business 
it is expected that fluctuations in revenue and margin will continue to occur in future periods 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in gross research and development spending which consists of research and development expense and capitalized software development costs decreased million to million in compared to million in the decrease in overall spending was driven by an improvement in internal processes within the research and development organization and a shifting of resources from third party consultants to internal resources

as a result of these initiatives  we expect depreciation and amortization to continue to increase in future periods 
interest income decreased  to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily related to lower cash and cash equivalent balances in as a result of these factors  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources during  operating activities provided million of cash

financing activities provided million from the proceeds of stock options exercised and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in the employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by the exercise of stock options was higher in than in the timing and amount of cash provided by future stock option exercises is uncertain 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity was our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances of million 
our future capital and liquidity requirements will depend upon a number of factors  including the rate of growth of our sales and the timing and level of research and development activities 
as of december   we have a commitment for capital expenditures related to our erp system of million 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash generated from our future operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements at least through

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
we generally invest in high quality debt instruments with relatively short maturities 
based upon the nature of our investments  we do not expect any material loss from our investments 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the following table illustrates potential fluctuation in annualized interest income based upon hypothetical values for blended interest rates and cash and marketable securities account balances 
annualized interest income based upon hypothetical values for cash and marketable securities combined balances and interest rates combined cash and cash equivalents and hypothetical marketable securities balances in thousands interest rate this sensitivity analysis is not a forecast of future interest income 
we account for cash equivalents and marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less 
cash equivalents are carried at cost  which approximates fair market value 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedge transactions 
through december   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
