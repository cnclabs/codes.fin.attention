item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the insurance company is engaged in the sale of insurance products with three primary lines of business individual annuities  individual life insurance  and group accident and health 
revenues are derived primarily from premiums received from the sale of annuity contracts  life and accident and health products  and gains or losses  from our investment portfolio 
as described in item a  since the insurance company has suspended the sale of traditional and universal life insurance due to existing market conditions 
for financial statement purposes  our revenues from the sale of whole life and term life insurance products and annuity contracts with life contingencies are treated differently from our revenues from the sale of annuity contracts without life contingencies  deferred annuities and universal life insurance products 
premiums from the sale of whole or term life insurance products and life contingent annuities are reported as premium income on our financial statements 
premiums from the sale of deferred annuities  universal life insurance products and annuities without life contingencies are not reported as premium revenues  but rather are reported as additions to policyholders account balances 
for these products  revenues are recognized over time in the form of policy fee income  surrender charges and mortality and other charges deducted from policyholders account balances 
profitability in the insurance company s individual annuities  individual life insurance and group accident and health depends largely on the size of its inforce block  the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline  and the efficiency of its claim and expense management 
unless specifically stated otherwise  all references to  and refer to our fiscal years ended  or the dates  as the context requires  december   december  and december   respectively 
when we use the term we  us and our we mean the corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
in this discussion  we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events  many of which  by their nature  are inherently uncertain and beyond our control 
these statements may relate to our future plans and objectives 
by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from results indicated in these forward looking statements 
important factors  among others  that could cause our results to differ from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed below and under certain factors that may affect our business 
executive overview results the corporation s earnings per share were for  as compared to in and in results in reflected a continuation of year to year increases in investment income and net realized investment gains from the prior years 
our total revenues in were million  compared to million in and million in the corporation s increases in earning and revenues in resulted primarily from the improved performance of the investment portfolio  particularly the investments in limited partnerships and capital gains 
the improvement of global capital and equity markets in and also contributed to our financial performance 
certain factors that may affect our business there are numerous factors  some of which are outside our control  which could have a material impact on our business 
these factors include market conditions  legal and regulatory changes and operational risk 
a summary of these factors is set below market conditions the corporation  like all companies  is affected by the general state of financial markets and economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
despite certain recent improvements in business conditions  the business environment in recent years has been difficult and the ability to obtain desired returns on the investment portfolio without exposing the corporation to excess risk has been challenging 
this  in turn  has had an impact on our willingness to expand sales of our single premium annuity products 
legal and regulatory risk as an insurance company  we are subject to substantial regulatory control 
any material change in the framework in which we operate could have a material impact on the business 
for further discussion on how we deal with the regulatory requirements  see business insurance regulation 
operational risk business is dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  our payment obligations under outstanding policies and the condition of the investment portfolio 
any internal failures in the internal processes  people  or systems could lead to adverse consequences to the corporation 
in addition  despite the contingency plans in place  the ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by the disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the community in which we are located 
interest rate risk the insurance company s principal products are deferred annuities  which are interest rate sensitive instruments 
in an interest rate environment of falling or stable rates the insurance company s annuity holders are less likely to seek to surrender their annuities prior to maturity to seek alternative  higher yielding investments 
however  in an environment of moderately or significantly increasing rates  such surrenders should be expected to increase 
the existence currently of surrender fees on approximately of the insurance company s outstanding deferred annuities acts as a deterrent against surrenders 
however  if interest rates climb sufficiently  such fees may not have a significant deterrent effect 
moreover  the surrender fees are only in effect for up to the first years of each annuity policy and  therefore  disappear over time see table below 
in the event of a substantial increase in surrenders during a short period of time  the insurance company may have to sell off longer term assets to pay current surrender liabilities 
the insurance company continually develops strategies to address the match between the timing of its assets and liabilities 
to that end  during  it reduced the amount of assets invested in longer term investments by approximately million and reinvested in short and intermediate return investments at slightly reduced yields 
these reduced yields were partially offset by the gains recognized by the insurance company from the sale of the longer term assets 
the insurance company also benefited in this regard from the consolidation of the issuers of the principal protected note investments in its investment portfolio in  which placed into the insurance company s investment portfolio a par value of approximately million in us treasury strips and similar instruments with maturity dat es commencing in to protect against a substantial sudden increase in rates basis points  the company has entered into a series of payor swaption investments 
under these investments  the company obtained the right to enter into interest rate swap agreements with counterparties under which the company s interest rate obligations are fixed and the counterparties obligations are variable  thus protecting the company from sudden rate increases 
see  item  management s discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources  asset liability management 
account value with surrender charges expiring year expiring account value in millions percent of account value expiring and later total pricing management believes that the insurance company is able to offer its products at competitive prices to its targeted markets as a result of i maintaining relatively low issuance costs by selling through the independent general agency system  ii minimizing home office administrative costs  and iii utilizing appropriate underwriting guidelines 
the long term profitability of sales of life and most annuity products depends on the degree of margin of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such products  and the ultimate profitability of sales of such products  are based on four major factors i persistency  ii rate of return on cash invested during the life of the policy or contract  iii expenses of acquiring and administering the policy or contract  and iv mortality 
persistency is the rate at which insurance policies remain in force  expressed as a percentage of the number of policies remaining in force over the previous year 
policyholders sometimes do not pay premiums  thus  causing their policies to lapse 
ratio of annualized voluntary terminations surrenders and lapses to mean life insurance in force the assumed rate of return on invested cash and desired spreads during the period that insurance policies or annuity contracts are in force also affects pricing of products and currently includes an assumption by the insurance company of a specified rate of return and or spread on its investments for each year that such insurance or annuity product is in force 
investment results the following table summarizes the insurance company s investment results for the periods indicated  as determined in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  in thousands cash and total invested assets net investment income effective yield net realized investment gains losses average of cash and aggregate invested amounts at the beginning and end of period 
net investment income is net of investment expenses and excludes capital gains and losses and provision for income taxes 
net investment income divided by average cash and total invested assets minus net investment income 
net realized investment gains losses include provisions for impairment in value that are considered other than temporary and exclude provisions for income taxes 
the reduction in the net investment income ratios from to was attributable to the low interest rate environment and overall economic conditions  which led to defaults or write downs within the company s investment portfolio 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities with higher interest rates and callable debt securities increased 
during such periods  the insurance company will likely not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields 
a general improvement in market conditions and an increase in net investment income were the primary factors in the to increase  while the rebalancing of the portfolio into lower yield  short term investments caused a decrease in the net investment income ratio in see  item  management s discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources  asset liability m anagement 
another major factor affecting profitability is the level of expenses 
management believes that one of the insurance company s strengths is its concentration on minimizing expenses through periodic review and adjustment of general and administrative costs 
investments the insurance company derives a predominant portion of its total revenues from investment income 
the insurance company manages most of its investments internally 
all investments made on behalf of the insurance company are governed by the statement of investment policy established and approved by the investment committee  the finance committee and the board of directors of the insurance company and the corporation and by qualitative and quantitative limits prescribed by applicable insurance laws and regulations 
the investment committee meets regularly to set and review investment policy and to approve current investment plans 
the actions of the investment committee are subject to review and approval by the finance committee and the board of directors of the insurance company and corporation 
the insurance company s statement of investment policy must comply with nysid regulations and the regulations of other applicable regulatory bodies 
the insurance company s investment philosophy generally focuses on purchasing investment grade securities with the intention of holding such securities to maturity 
however  as market opportunities  liquidity  or regulatory considerations may dictate  securities may be sold prior to maturity 
the insurance company has categorized all fixed maturity securities as available for sale and carries such investments at market value 
the insurance company manages its investment portfolio to meet the diversification  yield and liquidity requirements of its insurance policy and annuity contract obligations 
the insurance company s liquidity requirements are monitored regularly so that cash flow needs are satisfied 
adjustments periodically are made to the insurance company s investment policies to reflect changes in the insurance company s short and long term cash needs  as well as changing business and economic conditions 
the insurance company seeks to manage its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and our net investment income increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decline  the insurance company s fixed maturity investments generally will increase in market value  while net investment income will decrease as fixed income investments mature or are sold and proceeds are reinvested at the declining rates  and vice versa 
management is aware that prevailing market interest rates frequently shift and  accordingly  has adopted strategies that are designed to address either an increase or decrease in prevailing rates 
these strategies included the investments in payor swaptions  described be low 
the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
management evaluates whether other than temporary impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the insurance company in the other than temporary impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii the potential for impairmen ts of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi consistency with accounting treatment applicable to other similarly situated investments  and vii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the insurance company dee ms to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that the assumptions relied upon by the insurance company will yield accurate assessments of the fair value of these investments 
as such  the insurance company reassesses its assumptions regularly 
as of december   approximately of the insurance company s total invested assets were invested in limited partnerships and equity securities 
investments in limited partnerships are included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet under the heading other long term investments 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the insurance company is committed  if called upon during a specified period  to contribute an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to certain of these limited partnerships 
million in commitments will expire in  million in  in  in and in the insurance company may make selective investments in additional limited partnerships as opportunities arise 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments i 
e  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the insurance company to take annual distributions of partnership earnings 
there can be no assurance that the insurance company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships as it has historically 
further  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the insurance company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the primary market risks in the insurance company s investment portfolio are interest rate risk discussed above  credit risk and  to a lesser degree  equity price risk 
changes in credit risk are generally measured by changes in corporate yields in relation to the underlying treasuries corporate spreads as well as changes in the credit default swap cds market 
the insurance company s exposure to foreign exchange risk is insignificant 
the insurance company has no direct commodity risk 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact the corporation s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  the insurance company could be exposed to disintermediation risk asset liability mismatch and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margin

unrealized losses the following table presents the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities and common stock where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost at december  less than months months or more total fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses description of securities in thousands us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us government agencies corporate bonds preferred stocks subtotal fixed maturities common stock total the following table presents the total gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by december  gross unrealized losses of total in thousands less than twelve months twelve months or more total us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us agencies the unrealized loss on us treasuries and us agencies  totaling million or of cost at december   reflects a loss of market value of these fixed rate investments due to an overall increase in interest rates during the year 
because the company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity and due to the fact that these securities generally carry aaa ratings by moody s and aaa by standard and poor s  the company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired 
corporate bonds the predominant investment category for the company s investments is the corporate bond category  which totaled approximately billion at december  most of the million of unrealized short term losses in these investments represent increases in interest rates and widening of corporate credit spreads against treasuries in the year maturity spectrum of the yield curve 
two holdings  in ford motor credit and knight ridder  represent losses of approximately million and million  respectively and each exceed of book value 
ford motor credit s parent  ford motor co  has been affected by a decline in the domestic us automobile and truck industry 
ford motor credit is in a more secure position than its parent  as the credit company has a liquid portfolio of high quality receivables with the possibility of attracting a high quality financial company as a potential equity investor  as is being contemplated by general motors acceptance corp 
knight ridder has been rumored to be a leveraged buy out candidate  which has coincided with a decline in the market value of its bonds 
the company is closely monitoring the financial situation of each credit but believes that these investments are not other than temporarily impaired as of december  the company believes that it has the ability and intent to hold each of these positions to maturity 
the million of unrealized losses on assets held longer than months are attributable to a combination of higher interest rates  wider corporate credit spreads  rumors of potential lbo candidates and changes in specific industry conditions primarily automobile and food retailing 
the following represent credits that have experienced losses that exceed of book value and are more than  tenet healthcare million and neiman marcus group 
million 
tenet has been affected by issues related to a federal investigation of medicare reimbursement practices and the shutdown of hospitals caused by the hurricanes 
the company believes that these events should not result in an other than temporary impairment of the investment 
neiman marcus was the subject of an lbo in  which resulted in increased leverage 
however  the insurance company s bonds  which were previously unsecured  have become secured by real estate various store properties and other assets of neiman marcus 
this action should enhance the value of the bonds and reflect a not other than temporary impairment of value 
preferred stocks the insurance company had approximately million of losses on its preferred stock portfolio 
the aggregate holdings consist primarily of banks  financial companies  electric utilities and reit s real estate investment trusts 
most of the changes in market value reflect overall increases in interest rates  this condition should result in a not other than temporary impairment in value 
none of the individual losses exceed  and of book value 
common stocks the company had  of losses at december   none of which individually exceeded  and of book value 
most of these equities have readily available markets  trading on national stock exchanges  including the new york stock exchange and nasdaq 
principal protected notes between and  the insurance company made a series of investments in instruments known as principal protected notes 
these notes  marketed by investment companies  consist of an investment in a trust unit or corporate note 
the trusts contain two assets  a variable rate income note issued by a collateralized debt obligation structure and a aaa rated zero coupon security  primarily us treasury strips  with maturity dates no later than the variable rate income note and a face value equal to the principal amount of the investment in the principal protected note 
the us treasury strip is designed to defease the principal amount of the investment  while the variable rate income note provides periodic distributions of cash flow when sufficient cash flow is generated by the collateralized debt obligation structure 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  the company has consolidated the issuers of these notes 
as a result  the assets underlying the notes the variable rate income note and the aaa rated zero coupon securities are accounted for separately within the insurance company s investment portfolio 
substantially all of the variable rate income notes were sold in the zero coupon securities are recorded at cost and annual accretions are recorded as investment income 
statutory information the insurance company prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the new york state insurance department 
prescribed sap include state laws  regulations and general administrative rules  as well as a variety of publications from the naic 
accounting principles used to prepare statutory financial statements differ from financial statements prepared on the basis of gaap

there can be no assurance that the corporation s or the insurance company s ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
in the event the ratings are downgraded  the level of revenues or the persistency of the insurance company s business may be adversely impacted 
in january  am best company affirmed the insurance company s rating at b very good 
publications of am best indicate that the b rating is assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have achieved a very good overall performance when compared to the norms of the insurance industry and that generally have demonstrated a good ability to meet their respective policyholder and other contractual obligations over a long period of time 
in february  am best company reaffirmed the insurance company s rating at b very good with a stable outlook 
in evaluating a company s statutory financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity  as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves and the experience and competency of its management 
am best s rating is based on factors which primarily are relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and is not directed towards the protection of investors  nor is it intended to allow investors to rely on such a rating in evaluating the financial condition of the insurance company 
in may  moody s investor services moody s lowered the insurance company s insurance financial strength rating from ba questionable financial security to ba questionable financial security 
in may  moody s lowered its rating on the corporation s senior notes from b poor financial security to b poor financial security  but raised the outlook on the rating from negative to stable 
in june  standard poor s corporation standard poor s lowered the insurance company s insurance financial strength rating from a bb  which is defined as less vulnerable in the near term but faces major ongoing uncertainties to adverse business  financial and economic conditions to a bb which is defined as a vulnerability to the broad array of risks that are embedded in its investment and operational profile 
in june  standard poors lowered the credit rating of the senior notes from a b more vulnerable to adverse business  financial and economic conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial requirements to a b weak financial security  adverse business conditions will likely impair its ability to meet financial commitments but raised the credit watch rating from negative to stable 
the downgrades did not have a material impact on the financial statements of the corporation for results of operations comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year and fiscal year to fiscal year operating revenues annuity considerations and life insurance premiums total annuity considerations and life insurance premiums decreased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately and decreased from approximately million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately 
annuity considerations decreased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million and from approximately million in to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
life insurance premiums were million  million and million in  and respectively 
these amounts do not include consideration from the sales of deferred annuities or immediate annuities without life contingencies 
under gaap  such sales are reported as additions to policyholder account balances 
consideration from sales of single premium annuities were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily attributable to management s decision to reduce sales in order to conserve capital and improve the company s capital and surplus ratios 
policy fee income universal life and investment type policy fee income was approximately million in fiscal  million in and approximately million in fiscal the increased amounts of policy fee income in and were primarily the result of increased surrender charges collected by the company during those years 
policy fee income consists principally of amounts assessed during the period against policyholders account balances for mortality charges and surrender charges 
net investment income net investment income totaled million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal this represents a increase comparing fiscal to fiscal and a increase comparing fiscal to fiscal the increase from to was largely attributable to an increase in investment income from the insurance company s limited partnership investments 
in  income from these investments amounted to million 
income from these investments amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal in  increases in income from limited partnerships and short term investments was largely offset by a decrease in income from bonds from million in to million in after an increase from million in the decrease in income from fixed maturities was largely the result of the portfolio re balancing activities in  which resulted in the sale of higher yielding long term investments and the reinvestment into lower yielding short term investments 
see item  management s discussion and analysis  asset liability management 
in addition  the company increased the portion of its portfolio invested in short term assets to enhance liquidity 
the insurance company s ratios of net investment income to average cash and invested assets less net investment income for the years ended december   and were approximately  and  respectively 
without taking into account the corporation s returns on its limited partnership investments in those years  the respective ratios would have been  and for the years ended december   and for additional information  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains pre tax amounted to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in was largely attributable to gains from the portfolio rebalancing activities 
net realized investment gains for years ended december   and include realized investment losses of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  attributable to writedowns of certain securities contained in the insurance company s investment portfolio that were deemed by management to be other than temporarily impaired 
for a discussion of the procedure by which such determinations were made  see investments above 
realized investment gains losses also resulted from sales of certain equities and convertible securities and calls and sales of fixed maturity investments in the company s investmen t portfolio 
total benefits and expenses interest credited and benefits to policyholders interest credited and benefits paid to policyholders amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these represent an increase of comparing fiscal to fiscal and a decrease comparing fiscal to fiscal these amounts are consistent with the company s historic expense levels 
the spread between the insurance company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances and the insurance company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets  as determined under sap  the spread for the months ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the increases from to and were largely due to the recognition in and of the income from the us treasury strips underlying the principal protected notes see principal protected notes and increased returns from the company s limited partnership investments 
the spread was also affected by a reduction in the crediting rate to policyholders 
there can be no assurance that such positive spreads will continue in the future 
interest expense on notes payable the interest expense on the corporation s notes payable amounted to approximately million in fiscal  approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal general expenses  taxes and commissions general expenses  taxes and commissions to agents totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal this represents a decrease of comparing fiscal to fiscal and a decrease of comparing fiscal to fiscal the decreases in both and were principally attributable to lower costs associated with lower commissions and selling expenses incurred associated with the lower level of sales of single premium annuities 
the decreases were also attributable to a reduction in the insurance company s general expenses due to expense controls initiated in change in deferred policy acquisition costs the change in the net dac for the twelve months ended december  resulted in a charge of approximately million  as compared to a charge of approximately million and a credit of approximately million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
changes in deferred policy acquisition costs consist of three elements deferred costs associated with product sales  amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business and amortization of the dac on the remainder of the company s business 
deferred costs consisted of credits of million  million and million for  and respectively 
amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business consisted of charges of million  million and million in  and respectively 
amortization of the dac on the remainder of the company s business consisted of charges of million  m illion and million in  and respectively 
under applicable accounting rules fasb  dac related to deferred annuities is amortized in proportion to the estimated gross profits over the estimated lives of the contracts 
essentially  as estimated profits of the insurance company related to these assets increase  the amount and timing of amortization is accelerated 
the substantial increase in the dac charge in was attributable principally to the high levels of realized gains from the company s portfolio rebalancing program and increased income from the company s limited partnership investments 
see also the discussion of deferred policy acquisition costs under critical accounting policies below 
income before income taxes for the reasons discussed above  income loss before income taxes amounted to approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal income taxes income tax expense was approximately million for fiscal  as compared to an expense of approximately million for fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the increase in income taxes in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in net investment gains as compared to the increase in from was primarily attributable to an increase in investment income 
net income for the reasons discussed above  the corporation had net income of approximately million in fiscal  as compared to net income of approximately million in fiscal and a net income of approximately million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the corporation is an insurance holding company and its primary uses of cash are debt service obligations  operating expenses and dividend payments 
the corporation s principal sources of cash are sales of and interest on the corporation s investments and rent from its real estate 
during  the corporation s board of directors maintained the quarterly dividend rate of 
per share 
during and  the corporation did not repurchase any of its common stock  although at december   the corporation was authorized to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances that it may make to the corporation without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under the new york insurance law  the insurance company is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year or ii its net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year excluding realized capital gains and losses 
the insurance company will only be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend to the corporation in excess of that amount if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the superintendent does not disapprove the distribution 
the insurance company paid no dividends to the corporation in fiscal  or on a going forward basis  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the corporation in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
notwithstanding the above  the corporation was able to meet all its liquidity needs in  including the payment of dividends  and anticipates being able to meet those needs in and the foreseeable future 
principal sources of funds at the insurance company are premiums and other considerations paid  net investment income received and proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold 
the principal uses of these funds are the payment of benefits on annuity contracts and life insurance policies including withdrawals and surrender payments  the payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
given the insurance company s historical cash flow and current financial results  management believes that  for the next twelve months and for the reasonably foreseeable future  the insurance company s cash flow from operating activities will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the insurance company 
net cash provided by the insurance company s operating activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase from to and is largely attributable to the increase in net investment income 
net cash used in provided by in the insurance company s investing activities principally reflecting investments purchased less investments called  redeemed or sold was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for purposes of the corporation s consolidated statements of cash flows  financing activities relate primarily to sales and surrenders of the insurance company s annuity and universal life insurance products 
the payment of dividends by the corporation to its stockholders is also considered to be a financing activity 
net cash provided by used in by the insurance company s financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these fluctuations primarily are attributable to changes in policyholder account balances as a result of sales and interest earned by the policyholders 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants relating to limitations on liens and sale or issuance of capital stock of the corporation 
in the event the corporation violates such covenants as defined in the indenture  we may be obligated to offer to repurchase the entire outstanding principal amount of such notes 
as of december   we believe that we are in compliance with all of the covenants 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed 
we believe that a portfolio composed principally of fixed rate investments that generate predictable rates of return should back our fixed rate liabilities 
we do not have a specific target rate of return 
instead  our rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rate environment  the slope of the yield curve  the spread at which fixed rate investments are priced over the yield curve  and general economic conditions 
our portfolio strategy is designed to achieve adequate risk adjusted returns consistent with our investment objectives of effective asset liability matching  liquidity and safety 
in order to maintain consistency in our portfolio  our deferred annuity products incorporate surrender charges to discourage surrenders or withdrawals 
annuitants may not terminate or withdraw funds from their annuity contracts for a significant initial period generally seven years without incurring substantial penalties in the form of surrender charges 
these surrender charges generally range from to of the investment 
approximately  and of the insurance company s deferred annuity contracts in force measured by reserves as of december    and were surrenderable without charge 
the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio changes as interest rates change 
in general  rate decreases cause asset prices to rise  while rate increases cause asset prices to fall 
based on market values and prevailing interest rates as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous increase in interest rates of basis points would produce a loss in fair value of our fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
asset liability management a persistent concern of the insurance company s management is maintaining the appropriate balance between the duration of its invested assets and the duration of its contractual liabilities to its annuity holders and credit suppliers 
in the past  the insurance company had permitted the duration gap between its assets and liabilities to rise during a period in which it expected relatively stable interest rates and  most importantly  in which its liabilities were largely protected by significant annuity surrender charges 
this strategy benefited the company by allowing it to realize enhanced yield from longer duration assets 
at the end of  the insurance company determined that the prospect of rising rates and declining surrender charges necessitated a reduction in the duration mismatch  as well as increased management of extension risk in its investment portfolio 
the company developed a two step duration reduction strate gy  which involved the sale of certain longer duration assets that were purchased at prices below current market prices and reinvestment in shorter duration assets 
since december   the company has completed in excess of million of long duration sales and million of shorter duration reinvestments 
as the second element of the asset liability management strategy  the company hedged against the risks posed by a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates by entering into a form of derivative transaction known as payor swaptions 
swaptions are options to enter into an interest rate swap arrangement with a counter party at a specified future date 
at expiration  the counter party would be required to pay the insurance company the amount of the present value of the difference between the fixed rate of interest on the swap agreement and a specified strike rate in the agreement multiplied by the notional amount of the swap agreement 
the effect of these transactions would be to lessen the negative impact on the insurance company of a significant and prolonged increase in interest rates 
with the swaptions  the company should be able to maintain more competitive crediting rates to policyholders when interest rates rise 
in july  presidential life entered into a series of payor swaption investments designed to protect the company against an instantaneous rise in interest rates of basis points  as required by the new york state insurance department 
six contracts against the year swap rate were executed with one dealer and three banks at a total cost of  the company has established isda credit support agreements with the four counterparties 
three of the counterparties have ratings higher than aa aa by moody s and s p  respectively  and one counterparty carries an a a rating 
these contracts expire in july  july and july at varying strike rates based on the year swap rate 
the company has determined that the payor swaptions represent a non qualified hedge and has adopted accounting procedures consistent with the provisions of sfas the aggregate market value of the payor swaptions as of december  was  these investments are classified on the balance sheet as derivative instruments 
under sfas  the value of the payor swaptions is recognized at fair value market value  with the resulting change in fair value reflected in the income statement as a realized gain or loss 
the change in market value since purchase was a loss of  the company has determined that the average fair value for the period that the company has held these swaptions based upon weekly market values from july  to december  was  the insurance company  in consultation with its actuarial consultant  milliman  inc  is continually assessing its overall swaption portfolio to determine if sufficient protection is provided to cover projected realized losses in the event of a liquidation of assets to satisfy annuity surrenders under the aforementioned basis points increase in interest rates 
as part of this process  presidential may consider extending the maturity of its swaption portfolio by selling the swaptions maturing in july and purchasing a july swaption to cover future portfolio needs 
future consideration of this transaction or other asset liability management strategies is dependent upon periodic testing based on updated asset and liability data 
line of credit the short term notes payable relates to a line of credit issued by the bank of new york in the amount of  the line of credit provides for interest on borrowings based on the  and day libor rate depending on the duration of the corporation s periodic renewals 
at december   the corporation had the full  outstanding 
the line of credit renews annually and is up for renewal on april  if the bank chooses not to renew the line of credit  the corporation would be forced to pay down the  in april or seek alternative financing options 
the corporation does not believe that there would be a material adverse impact on its liquidity or cash flow position if the line of credit were to be called in april off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has made no financial commitments or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiary or special purpose entity 
all of the corporation s subsidiaries are wholly owned and their results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contain information regarding payments required under existing long term borrowing arrangements 
the following presents a summary of the corporation s significant contractual obligations 
payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total long term debt obligations policyholder account balance with contractual maturities these liabilities are reflected within policyholder liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet  and amount to million as of december  the difference between the recorded liability and the total payment amount is million and is comprised of i future interest to be credited and ii the effect of mortality discount for those payments that are life contingent 
most of the remaining policyholder liabilities  million involve deferred annuity contracts  which are contractually surrenderable at any time 
approximately of these obligations have surrender penalties 
these surrender charges  along with those contracts that involve contractual maturities  help to mitigate the asset liability management process 
see discussion under liquidity and capital resources section 
long term debt obligations consist of million  senior notes due february  see note in notes to the consolidated financials statements for additional discussion concerning both long term and short term obligations 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes in a rising interest rate environment  the insurance company s average cost of funds would be expected to increase over time  as it prices its new and renewing annuities to maintain a generally competitive market rate 
in addition  the market value of the insurance company s fixed maturity portfolio would be expected to decrease  resulting in a decline in shareholders equity 
concurrently  the insurance company would attempt to place new funds in investments that were matched in duration to  and higher yielding than  the liabilities associated with such annuities 
moreover  surrenders of its outstanding annuities would likely accelerate 
management believes that liquidity necessary in such an interest rate environment to fund withdrawals  including surrenders  would be available through income  cash flow  the insurance company s cash reserves and  if necessary  proceeds from the cash surrender of the payor swaption investments described above and the sale of short term and long term investments 
in a declining interest rate environment  the insurance company s cost of funds would be expected to decrease over time  reflecting lower interest crediting rates on its fixed annuities 
should increased liquidity be required for withdrawals in such an interest rate environment  management believes that the portion of the insurance company s investments that are designated as available for sale in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet could be sold without materially adverse consequences in light of the general strengthening in market prices that would be expected in the fixed maturity security market 
interest rate changes also may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of our annuity products 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuity or life insurance products offered by the insurance company s competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of the insurance company s products until the insurance company increases the rates credited to holders of its annuity products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we would attempt to lower our credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in net investment income 
as a result  changes in interest rates could materially adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the insurance company depending on the attractiveness of alternative investments available to the insurance company s customers 
in that regard  in the current interest rate environment  the insurance company has attempted to maintain it s credited rates at competitive levels designed to discourage surrenders and also to be considered attractive to purchasers of new annuity products 
recent accounting pronouncements see item o  notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of the new accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and the effects on the results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies  estimates and related judgments underlying the corporation s consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
in applying these accounting policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the insurance company s business operations 
investments the insurance company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of other than temporary impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
recognition of income ceases when a bond goes into default and management evaluates whether temporary or other than temporary impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are a ssumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the other than temporary impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii whether the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii financial difficulties being experienced by an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv economically depressed geographic locations  v situations where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi in situations where it is determined that an impairment is attributable to changes in market interest rates  the corporation s ability and intent to hold impaired securities until recovery of fair value at or above cost  and vii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating age ncies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect of the estimated fair value amounts 
deferred policy acquisition costs the insurance company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new business 
under applicable accounting rules  these costs  which vary  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related product  which in turn is dependent mainly on investment returns in excess of interest credited  as well as persistency and expenses 
these factors enter into management s estimate of future gross profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
changes in these estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the deferred acquisition cost asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross profits are less than amounts deferred 
future policy benefits the insurance company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under life and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements included herein are calculated based on gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states in which the insurance company does business and those reflected in the insurance company s statutory financial statements 
these differences arise from the use of different mortality and morbidity tables and interest rate assumptions  the introduction of lapse assumptions into the reserve calculation and the use of the net level premium reserve method on all insurance business 
see notes g  h and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the reserves reflected in the corporation s consolidated financial statements are based upon the corporation s best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products 
for all interest sensitive products  the policy account value is equal to the accumulation of gross premiums plus interest credited less mortality and expense charges and withdrawals 
in determining reserves for its insurance and annuity products  the insurance company performs periodic studies to compare current experience for mortality  interest and lapse rates with expected experience in the reserve assumptions 
differences are reflected currently in earnings for each period 
the insurance company historically has not experienced significant adverse deviations from its assumptions
