item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview dow jones company is a leading provider of global business and financial news and information through newspapers  newswires  magazines  the internet  indexes  licensing  television and radio 
in addition  the company owns general interest community newspapers throughout the us for the year ended december   approximately of the company s revenues were derived from the print publishing segment  which is primarily comprised of the global editions of the wall street journal 
the company s overall financial results are largely dependent on the operating performance of the wall street journal  which  to a significant extent  is dependent upon business to business bb advertising placed in its publications  particularly from the financial and technology sectors 
the electronic publishing segment  which includes newswires  online publishing  indexes and other electronic operations  comprised approximately of the company s revenue  while the remaining approximately of total revenues were contributed from the general interest community newspapers segment 
in  while profits from our electronic publishing segment were particularly strong  our print publishing segment continued to face a difficult industry wide print advertising environment 
as a result  for the year  advertising linage at the wall street journal declined 
advertising in the journal was down in the first six months and up in the latter six months aided by the september launch of the weekend edition and an increase in weekday advertising 
while advertisers continue to decide their spending close to actual publication dates  making predictions difficult  we expect this improved trend to continue into the first quarter of we remain focused on improving quality  controlling our spending  sharpening our execution  improving under performing businesses  and executing on the many strategic initiatives currently underway to reshape o ur portfolio and drive future growth 
these initiatives include the acquisition of marketwatch in january  the september launch of the weekend edition  the october launch of new reformatted international compact editions of the journal  and the recently announced content and design changes and planned web width reduction at the us journal to debut in january we expect that weekend edition will build off the success of our weekend journal and personal journal weekday sections in growing and diversifying our advertising customer base by attracting more consumer oriented advertisers 
we have a uniquely influential and affluent audience that not only makes large bb spending decisions but also spends heavily on personal consumption items 
the weekend edition enables advertisers to reach these readers in the right place at the right time at home on the weekend which is highly conducive to influencing their consumer spending decisions 
more than advertisers supported the weekend edition in  with of them new to the journal 
about of the ad revenue is from consumer advertising  with only about of it shifting from the weekday editions 
while this initiative diluted earnings by about cen ts per share in  and is expected to dilute earnings in by about cents per share  we believe that the weekend edition will be a major driver of long term growth in revenue and earnings 
in october  we announced a number of innovative design and content enhancements to the journal s us print edition  which will be made to better serve existing readers and attract new ones 
these improvements will include changes to the journal s organization  navigation and content as well as stronger links to wsj 
com designed to make accessing journal content faster and more convenient for readers 
some of these enhancements will be introduced during  culminating in january with a redesign of the journal and reformatting to a more industry standard inch web width from its current inch web width 
retrofitting presses in the journal s print sites to print the new web width is expected to be completed by january and the capital cost for such is estimated at million  of which million was expended in  and we expect the remainder will be expended in million and million 
we will also incur about million in one time training  development and marketing costs for the project  million of which will be incurred in the redesigned and newly formatted paper will launch in january and  excluding one time start up costs  we expect to save about million per year in operating expenses after about million per year in non cash depreciation expense  mainly from reduced newsprint consumption  starting in the project is expected to generate an after tax return on investment of about with a payback period of less than three years 
this initiative is expected to dilute earnings in by about cents per share and be accretive to earnings in and thereafter by about cents per share 
we have also undertaken a number of other initiatives to reshape our portfolio and to increase profits for the company 
in october  we launched reformatted compact editions at our international editions in an easier to read format that is more tightly integrated with wsj 
com to better serve the needs of highly mobile international business leaders 
we expect this international repositioning will not only improve annual profits by million  mainly from reduced costs  but also drive increased revenue 
during we also entered into an agreement to exit our unprofitable television partnerships with cnbc in europe and asia and in cnbc world  while maintaining our profitable licensing relationship with cnbc in the us the exit is expected to eliminate about million of annual pretax equity losses 
on january   we completed the acquisition of marketwatch for a purchase price of approximately million  including certain transaction costs  significantly expanding our participation in online publishing 
marketwatch is a leading provider of company  markets and business news  financial information and analytical tools and operates two award winning web sites marketwatch 
com and bigcharts 
com 
prior to the acquisition these free  advertising supported  sites served approximately seven million unique visitors per month with timely market news and information 
marketwatch also operates marketwatch licensing services  which is a leading licensor of news  data  investment analysis tools and other online applications to financial services firms  media companies  and corporations for use mainly on their intranets and retail web sites 
nbs p  marketwatch has been fully integrated into our consumer electronic publishing business  with extensive integration of its news  advertising sales  information technology and back office operations 
the company believes that the marketwatch merger complements the wall street journal online network  which provides premium business news to about three million unique visitors per month 
by combining the traffic of the wall street journal online network and marketwatch into the dow jones online network  our web sites averaged approximately nine million unduplicated unique visitors per month during the combined consumer electronic publishing business exceeded our profit expectations for  largely due to higher than expected cost synergy savings on the marketwatch integration 
we are very proud to have won two additional pulitzer prizes in  one for health care coverage and the other for film criticism 
these awards represent our th and st pulitzers  and are especially gratifying as they were awarded in our new business of life coverage areas

print publishing print publishing  which is largely comprised of the global editions of the wall street journal  publishes business and financial content world wide 
this content is published primarily in the us  europe  asia and latin america editions of the wall street journal and on us television through a licensing agreement with cnbc 
the company manages the global journal operations as one segment as their products comprise the global journal brand  and there are significant interrelationships within the editions including global management  shared news flows and workforce and a global advertising customer base  sales force and pricing 
us television  which represents a licensing agreement with nbc universal to provide branding  news content and on air expertise to cnbc  is a further extension of the journal brand and content 
us television contributes a s ignificantly higher operating margin than the publications within the segment since it largely represents incremental revenue for the global journal content and branding 
the company also includes the operations of barron s within print publishing instead of reporting them separately because of their relative immateriality to the company s results on a consolidated basis and because barron s shares services with and its operations are similar to the global journal

liquidity and capital resources overview the primary source of the company s liquidity is cash flow from operating activities 
the key component of operating cash inflow is cash receipts from advertising customers and subscribers to print publications and electronic information services 
operating cash outflows include payments to vendors for raw materials  services and supplies  payments to employees  and payments of interest and income taxes 
certain employee compensation  such as bonuses and payments to the company s defined contribution pension plan  are paid annually in the first quarter of the year 
as previously disclosed  in the company established a reserve for the present value of the total estimated payments through october in connection with the company s guarantee of certain minimum payments for data acquired by the company s former telerate subsidiary from cantor fitzgerald securities cantor and market data corporation mdc 
bridge information systems  inc  which purchased telerate in  filed for bankruptcy but made payments for this data for the post petition periods through october  when telerate ceased operations  went out of business  sold certain assets and rejected its contracts with cantor and mdc 
the company is now in litigation with cantor and mdc with respect to their claims for amounts allegedly due under the contract guarantee 
the company has various substantial defenses to these claims and the litigation is proce eding 
as of december   the reserve for the contract guarantee was million  all of which is classified as current based on the original due dates of the contract 
due to the stage of the lawsuit at december   it is not possible to determine whether the court will find that any obligation under the guarantee may be dismissed or reduced 
accordingly  the company believes the balance of the reserve continues to be appropriate 
the company s liquidity requirements may be funded  if necessary  through the issuance of commercial paper  bank loans or debt securities 
debt outstanding at december  was million which consisted of year bonds totaling million and commercial paper of million with various maturities of less than a year 
it is currently the company s intent to manage its commercial paper borrowings as short term obligations 
the company s commercial paper program is supported by multiyear revolving credit facilities with several banks 
as of december   the company could borrow up to million  million through june  and million through june  under its multiyear revolving credit agreements with several banks 
the company intends to renew the revolving credit line set to expire on june  the revolving credit agreements contain restrictive covenants  including a limitation on the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated cash flow and a requirement to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated cash flow to consolidated interest expense 
on august   the company amended its year credit agreement dated june  and its year credit agreement dated june  to temporarily increase the leverage covenant  from x to x  for each of the two quarters ended september  and december  at december   the company was in compliance with respect to both of these restrictive covenants then in effect  with the actual leverage ratio equaling less than x 
the company s original restrictive covenants will be effective for periods subsequent to december future liquidity and capital resources requirements in  the company expects its beginning cash balance and cash provided by operations to be sufficient to meet its recurring operating commitments  fund capital expenditures of about million  including million related to the reconfiguration of presses for the previously announced web width reduction initiative  and pay dividends 
after funding capital expenditures and dividends  the company anticipates that remaining excess cash flow from operations will be used to reduce and service its debt 
as previously disclosed  litigation with cantor and mdc with respect to their claim for amounts allegedly due under the contract guarantee is proceeding 
in the event there is an adverse judgment against the company it would likely be appealed 
if any significant amounts are ultimately considered due  they would likely be financed through the issuance of additional d ebt

critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be important to understanding the company s financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
actual results may differ from estimates 
revenue recognition advertising revenue  net of commissions  is recognized in the period in which the advertisement is displayed 
the company s advertising rate card reflects certain volume based discounts and certain customers also qualify for volume based bonus advertisements 
these programs require management to make certain estimates regarding future advertising volume 
the estimated rebates and bonus advertisements are recorded as reductions of revenue in the periods the advertisements are displayed and are revised as necessary based on actual volume realized 
for the years ended december   and  the company s estimated rebate and bonus advertising reserves totaled million  million and million  respectively and were classified as a liability 
certain online related advertising revenues are based on the number of impressions d elivered and are recognized as impressions occur  while other online advertising revenues are based on a fixed duration campaign and are recognized ratably over the term of the campaign 
revenue recognition from subscriptions to the company s print publications and information services is recognized in income as earned  pro rata on a per issue basis  over the subscription period 
circulation revenue includes sales to retail outlets newsstands  which are subject to returns 
the company records these retail sales upon delivery  net of estimated returns 
these estimated returns are based on historical return rates and are revised as necessary based on actual returns experienced 
the company s estimated returns reserves totaled approximately million for each of the years ended december   and costs in connection with the procurement of subscriptions are charged to expense as incurred 
revenue from licensing the dow jones averages includes both upfront one time fees and ongoing revenue 
both upfront fees and ong oing licensing revenue are recognized in income as earned over the license period 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable includes an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is an estimate of amounts that may not be collectible 
this estimated allowance is based on historical trends  review of aging categories and the specific identification of certain customers that are at risk of not paying 
actual write offs of bad debt have historically been insignificant  less than of revenues 
pensions and other postretirement benefits certain costs and related obligations of the company are based on actuarial assumptions  including some of its pension plans and the cost of the company s postretirement medical plan  which provides lifetime health care benefits to retirees who meet specified length of service and age requirements 
these benefit costs are expensed over the employee s expected employment period 
at december   the company s postretirement retiree medical benefit obligation was million  which is not funded as it is the company s policy to fund postretirement medical costs as claims are incurred 
in determining the cost of retiree medical costs  some factors that management must consider include the expected increase in health care costs  discount rates and turnover and mortality rates  which are updated periodically based on recent actual trends 
the company s discount rate was determined by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments  as defined for the projected benefit obligations  and discounting those expected payments using an average of yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the cost for by million 
conversely  a one percentage point decline in assumed health care cost trend rates would have lowered the benefit obligation at the end of by million and the cost for by million 
a one quarter of one percentage point decrease in the company s expected discount rate in would have increased retiree medical expense by approximately million 
the majority of the company s employees who meet specific length of service requirements are covered by defined contribution retirement plans  which are funded currently 
substantially all employees who are not covered by these plans are covered by defined benefit pension plans based on length of service and age requirements 
at december   the company s accumulated pension benefit obligation was million  of which million was funded 
in determining the cost and obligation of the defined pension benefit plans  management must consider such factors as the expected return on plan assets  discount rates  mortality rates and expected employee salary increases 
while the company believes its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or changes in these assumptions would affect the calculation of its projected o bligation and cost under the defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans 
the company evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually 
a one quarter of one percentage point decrease in the expected discount rate on the company s defined benefit pension plans in would have increased pension expense by approximately million 
long lived assets management must use its judgment in assessing whether the carrying value of certain long lived assets  cost method investments  identifiable intangibles and goodwill is impaired and if any asset is impaired  the extent of any such loss 
certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and require an impairment review 
based on that review  if the carrying value of these assets exceeds fair value and is determined to not be recoverable  an impairment loss representing the amount of excess over its fair value would be recognized in income 
fair value estimates are based on quoted market values in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
management also exercises judgment in determining the estimated useful life of long lived assets  specifically plant  property and equipment and certain intangible assets with a finite life 
the company depreciates the cost of buildings over years  improvements to the buildings over years  software over to years and machinery and equipment over to years 
the year life is applicable to the company s press equipment 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases 
management bases its judgment on estimated lives of these assets based on actual experienced length of service of similar assets and expert opinions 
the company also obtains third party appraisals to assist in determining whether an intangible asset has an indefinite life 
stock based compensation the company maintains a stock incentive plan under the dow jones long term incentive plan 
this plan provides for the grant of contingent stock rights  stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and other stock based awards 
the company accounts for its stock based compensation in accordance with apb and its related interpretations 
under apb  pretax stock based compensation charged to income principally in relation to the company s contingent stock rights  restricted stock units and restricted stock awards was million in  million in and million in had the company s stock based compensation been determined by the fair value based method of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  the company s earnings per share for  and would have been reduced by approxim ately 
per share  
per share and 
per share  respectively 
see notes and for additional details on our stock compensation plans 
contingencies management must exercise judgment in assessing the likely outcome of contingencies including those relating to tax matters  legal proceedings and other matters that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and those described in note to the financial statements 
both the timing and amount of the provisions made in the financial statements and related disclosures represent management s judgment of likelihood  based on information available at the time and on the advice of legal counsel 
judicial or governmental bodies largely determine the outcome of these matters 
with regard to tax matters  the ultimate resolution of these matters  either by determinations by these bodies or other means  could be materially different from that assumed by the company in making its provisions and related disclosures 
at the time that these tax contingencies are resolved by tax examination or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the company adjusts its tax accounts accordingly 
tax valuation allowance the company records a tax valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
currently  the company maintains a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to its capital loss carryforward 
the company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company subsequently determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
