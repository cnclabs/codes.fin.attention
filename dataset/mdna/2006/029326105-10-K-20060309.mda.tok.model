critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
we use historical loss data  peer group experience and the economic environment as factors  among others  in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan and lease portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
other estimates that we use are related to the expected useful lives of our depreciable assets 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of the credit loss risk in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual risk or loss events occur 
the analysis of the allowance uses an historical loss view as an indicator of future losses and as a result could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since our analysis of risk and loss potential is updated regularly  the errors that might otherwise occur are mitigated 
the use of factors and ranges is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the company s goal is to maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that is between the lower and upper ranges as described above 
if the allowance for loan and lease losses falls below the lower range of adequate reserves by reason of loan and lease growth  actual losses  the effect of changes in risk ratings  or some combination of these factors  the company has a strategy for supplementing the allowance for loan and lease losses  over the short term  so that it would again fall within the lower and upper acceptable ranges

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
since the company s stock option plan provides for the issuance of options at a price of no less than the fair market value at the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements unless the options are modified after the grant date 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement number revised fas r  share based payments 
fas r requires all entities to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments such as stock options granted to employees 
the company is required to apply fas r on a modified prospective method  beginning on january  under this method  the company is required to record compensation expense as previous awards continue to vest for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
management believes that the effect of fas r will be consistent with its pro forma disclosures included in note to the consolidated financial statements in
