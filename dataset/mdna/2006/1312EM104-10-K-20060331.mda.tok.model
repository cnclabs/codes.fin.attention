item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
overview we are a development stage biopharmaceutical company  whose primary focus is on biopharmaceutical product development 
since inception in june our efforts have been principally devoted to research and development  securing patent protection  obtaining corporate relationships and raising capital 
since inception through december   we have sustained cumulative net losses of  our losses have resulted primarily from expenditures incurred in connection with clinical development of licensed products  the purchase of in process research and development  stock based compensation expense  patent filing and maintenance  outside accounting and legal services and regulatory consulting fees 
from inception through december  we have not generated any revenue from operations 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we develop our product candidates  expand our clinical development team and prepare for the commercial launch of our product candidates 
we do not currently have any commercial biopharmaceutical products  and do not expect to have such for several years  if at all 
to date  our sources of cash have been primarily limited to the sale of our equity securities 
on february   we closed a private placement of  shares of common stock and  common stock purchase warrants to certain accredited investors 
the warrants are exercisable for months from closing at an exercise price of per share 
the securities were sold at a price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million  for which net proceeds were million 
on august   we closed a private placement of  shares of common stock to certain existing stockholders 
the shares were sold at a price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million  for which net proceeds were million 
on march   we completed a private placement of an aggregate  shares of our common stock at a per share price of  for aggregate gross proceeds of million and for which net proceeds were million 
we have devoted substantially all of our capital resources to the in licensing and development of our product candidates 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with an in house research and development laboratory  salaries and staff  application and filing for regulatory approval of our proposed products  purchase of in process research and development  regulatory and scientific consulting fees  contract research and royalty payments to outside suppliers  facilities and universities as well as legal and professional fees associated with filing and maintaining our patent and license rights to our proposed products 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly in the future as we develop our product candidates 
our general and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and related costs  rent and professional service fees 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase significantly over the next few years as we continue to build our operations to support our product candidates and as we incur costs associated with being a publicly traded company 
history in march  callisto pharmaceuticals  inc old callisto  a non public company  purchased of the outstanding common shares of webtronics  inc  a public company webtronics  for  webtronics was incorporated in florida on february  and had limited operations during the year ended december  on april   pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated march   as amended april   synergy acquisition corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of webtronics merged into synergy pharmaceuticals inc synergy and callisto acquisition corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of webtronics merged into old callisto collectively  the merger 
as a result of the merger  old callisto and synergy became wholly owned subsidiaries of webtronics 
old callisto changed its name to callisto research labs  llc and webtronics changed its name to callisto pharmaceuticals  inc and changed its state of incorporation from florida to delaware plan of operations our plan of operations for the next year is to focus primarily on the development of two drugs to treat leukemia  multiple myeloma an incurable blood cancer that invades and proliferates in bone marrow and advanced carcinoid tumors 
our lead drug in development for leukemia  l annamycin  earlier completed a phase i iia trial in relapsed or refractory acute leukemia patients 
on december  we initiated a clinical trial in adult relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia patients 
our second drug candidate  atiprimod  is presently in a phase i iia clinical trial in multiple myeloma patients  and in a phase i iia clinical trial in advanced cancer patients 
the drug is an orally available drug with antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity 
our plan of research studies include further pre clinical work on guanilib  in preclinical development for gastrointestinal inflammation  a drug exploratory program focused on a class of anticancer compounds called degrasyns  and a monoclonal antibody and vaccine candidate that are being explored as biodefense agents against staphylococcal and streptococcal bioterrorism agents 
l annamycin on august   we entered into a world wide license agreement with the university of texas md anderson cancer center to research  develop  sell and commercially exploit the patent rights for l annamycin  an anthacycline cancer drug for leukemia therapy 
consideration paid for this license amounted to  for reimbursement of out of pocket costs for filing  enforcing and maintaining the annamycin patent rights and a  initial license fee 
we also agreed to pay the university of texas md anderson cancer center royalties based on net sales from any licensed products  plus aggregate milestone payments of up to  based upon achieving certain regulatory submissions and approvals 
the term of the agreement is from august  until november  under the terms of the license agreement  we are required to make certain good faith expenditures towards the clinical development of at least one licensed product within the two year period after march in addition  at any time after years from august   the university of texas md anderson cancer center has the right to terminate the license if we fail to provide evidence within days of written notice that we have commercialized or we are actively and effectively attempting to commercialize annamycin 
l annamycin was discovered by scientists at the university of texas md anderson cancer center and initially evaluated in a phase i clinical trial in patients with relapsed solid tumors  a phase ii clinical trial in patients with doxorubicin resistant breast cancer  and a phase i iia trial in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia aml or relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia all 
we began a clinical trial at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in adult relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia all patients on december  this single arm  open label trial will enroll patients in a dose escalation phase i portion  followed by patients in a final fixed dose in the phase ii portion 
we plan to treat up to patients 
we also expect to commence two additional trials with l annamycin in  a single agent trial of l annamycin in pediatric relapsed or refractory all patients  and a combination trial of l annamycin in combination with ara c in adult relapsed or refractory aml patients 
atiprimod on august   and as amended on may   synergy entered into a worldwide license agreement with anormed to research  develop  sell and commercially exploit the atiprimod patent rights 
the license agreement provides for aggregate milestone payments of up to million based upon achieving certain regulatory submissions and approvals for an initial indication  and additional payments of up to million for each additional indication based on achieving certain regulatory submissions and approvals 
in addition the agreement requires synergy to pay anormed royalties on net sales 
commencing on january  and on january of each subsequent year  synergy is obligated to pay anormed a maintenance fee of  until the first commercial sale of the product 
the first two annual maintenance fee payments under this agreement were made in january and and were recorded as research and development expense 
the license agreement will terminate in on may  we commenced a phase i iia clinical trial of atiprimod in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients at two sites  the dana farber cancer institute boston and the university of texas md anderson cancer center houston 
on january   we announced the opening of two additional sites for the phase i iia clinical trial of atiprimod  the roswell park cancer institute in buffalo  new york  and the st 
vincent s comprehensive cancer center in new york  new york 
the clinical trial is an open label study  with the primary objective of assessing safety of drug and identifying the maximum tolerated dose 
the secondary objectives are to measure the pharmacokinetics  evaluate the response in patients with refractory disease and to identify possible surrogate responses to the drug to better determine the mechanism of drug action 
in december  we announced an update on interim results from this trial performed in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma patients which consisted of patients treated with atiprimod  including patients at the highest dose level of mg day 
two patients exhibited stable disease  with one patient having a decrease in m protein measure of tumor burden over months of treatment 
it was also noted that two patients reported a subjective decrease in bone pain 
we plan to continue this trial at higher dose levels until the maximum tolerated dose is reached and then treat additional patients at that level 
on march  we announced a second phase i iia clinical trial of atiprimod in advanced cancer patients 
the new trial is entitled an open label study of the safety and efficacy of atiprimod treatment for patients with advanced cancer 
the primary objective is to assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose of atiprimod in advanced cancer patients 
the secondary objectives are to measure the pharmacokinetics of atiprimod and evaluate the response in a variety of relapsed solid tumors and hematological malignancies 
the trial is currently being conducted at the university of texas md anderson cancer center 
on february   we announced plans to launch an additional indication for clinical development of atiprimod based on encouraging clinical results from the advanced cancer clinical trial that showed a clear response in a patient with advanced carcinoid cancer plus additional encouraging clinical data on other carcinoid patients 
based on these new clinical data  we plan to initiate a new phase i ii clinical trial of atiprimod in carcinoid cancer patients with advanced metastatic tumors at several clinical sites in the next few months 
guanylate cyclase receptor agonist technology guanilib our guanylate cyclase receptor agonist gcra program is based on control of cyclic gmp  an important second messenger involved in key cellular processes  which are essential for maintenance of the balance between proliferation and cellular death apoptosis 
uroguanylin  a hormone produced by and secreted by specialized cells in the human gi tract  helps to maintain this balance by activating synthesis of cyclic gmp through activation of guanylate cyclase receptor 
recent findings suggest roles of cyclic gmp in gi inflammatory diseases 
we have successfully developed a potent analog synthetic molecule of uroguanylin called guanilib formerly called sp 
guanilib has been demonstrated to be superior to uroguanylin in its biological activity  protease stability and ph characteristics 
guanilib is currently undergoing pre clinical animal studies as a treatment for gi inflammation in a collaborative study involving clinical gastroenterologist dr 
scott plevy of the university of pittsburgh 
recent results from his laboratory showed that guanilib was efficacious in treatment of colitis in mice 
a patent allowance covering therapeutic applications of guanilib in colon cancer and gi inflammatory diseases has recently been granted by the us patent and trademark office 
degrasyns on january   we entered into a license agreement with the university of texas md anderson cancer center whereby we were granted the exclusive right to manufacture  have manufactured  use  import  offer to sell and or sell anti cancer compounds called tyrphostins renamed degrasyns 
degrasyns are a second generation class of tyrphostins developed by scientists at the university of texas md anderson cancer center that have a novel anti cancer mechanism of action that centers on their ability to selectively degrade key proteins that are involved in tumor cell proliferation and survival 
we plan to work closely with scientists at the university of texas md anderson cancer center during to bring forward a pre clinical candidate for development in the clinic 
superantigen based bioterorrism defense on august   we entered into a license agreement to research  develop  sell and commercially exploit certain rockefeller university licensed patents covering peptides and antibodies useful in treating toxic shock syndrome and septic shock 
we agreed to work toward commercialization of products related to these patents as evidenced by a minimum expenditure of approximately  per year  plus milestone payments and royalties of between and of annual net sales and will pay rockefeller of any sublicense fee paid by sublicensees 
the licensed patents under this agreement are the subject of research being funded by the niaid grant awarded to us on april  for  over two years 
the license agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the related patents 
on july   we entered into a license agreement to research  develop  sell and commercially exploit certain rockefeller university licensed patents covering the regulation of exoprotein in staphylococcus aureus 
we agreed to pay rockefeller a  annual maintenance fee until the first commercial sale of the product  plus royalties of and of net sales of product depending on whether the product is covered by a claim under the licensed patents or derived from a claim under the licensed patents and will pay rockefeller of any sublicense fee paid by sublicensees 
the agreement will terminate in november rockefeller may terminate the license agreement if we are more than days late in paying rockefeller any amounts due under the license agreement or if we breach the license agreement 
we have paid the annual maintenance fee for the year ended july   and have accrued but not paid the annual maintenance fee for the twelve months ended july   and  pending our evaluation as to the applicability of the patents licensed under this agreement to our ongoing toxic shock syndrome and septic shock development program under the august  agreement 
we are exploring the development of a monoclonal antibody as a therapeutic agent to prevent  treat and control superantigen mediated bioweapons 
our goal is to demonstrate therapeutic utility of this agent in an animal model in which toxic shock is induced by an aerosolized superantigen toxin 
the research work involves collaboration with dr 
sina bavari  us army medical research institute of infectious diseases  fort detrick  md 
we are also exploring strategic alternatives regarding further development of the superantigen program  including spin off or strategic partnership 
manufacturing an improved manufacturing method for annamycin has been developed at antibioticos spa  our commercial supplier of good manufacturing practice  or gmp  drug substance 
gmp material is currently being produced in sufficient quantity for all three anticipated phase i ii trials 
currently  antibioticos spa is our sole supplier of annamycin for our clinical trials 
our agreement with antibioticos provides that antibioticos spa will provide grams of gmp drug substance annamycin for our l annamycin clinical trials 
upon the conclusion of our phase iib clinical trials  the agreement provides that the parties will negotiate in good faith towards a commercial supply agreement for annamycin 
if our relationship with this contract manufacturer  or any other contract manufacturer we might use  terminates or if any of their facilities are damaged for any reason  including fire  flood  earthquake or other similar event  we may be unable to obtain supply of annamycin 
if any of these events were to occur  we may need to find alternative manufacturers or manufacturing facilities 
the number of contract manufacturers with the expertise  required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture annamycin on a commercial scale is extremely limited  and it would take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative manufacturers 
if we need to change to other commercial manufacturers  the fda and comparable foreign regulators must approve these manufacturers facilities and processes prior to our use  which would require new testing and compliance inspections 
in addition  we may not have the intellectual property rights  or may have to share intellectual property rights  to any improvements in the current manufacturing processes or any new manufacturing processes for annamycin 
any of these factors could cause us to delay or suspend clinical trials  regulatory submissions  required approvals or commercialization of l annamycin  entail higher costs  and could result in our being unable to commercialize l annamycin successfully 
one large scale gmp production run of atiprimod dimaleate led to the successful release of kg of material available for future phase ii clinical studies 
we plan to enter into a supply contract for atiprimod with a commercial supplier by the end of or after confirming activity of the drug candidate in our current human clinical trials 
employees our plan is to use contract research organizations cro for most of our development efforts  including monitoring of clinical trial results  thus minimizing the need to hire full time employees 
as of march   we had full time and part time employees 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounting for stock based compensation we have adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
as provided for by sfas  we have also elected to account for our stock based compensation programs according to the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
accordingly  compensation expense has been recognized based on the intrinsic value of stock issued or options granted to employees and directors for services rendered 
other stock based compensation associated with grants to non employees  as well as directors who perform services outside of their board duties  is measured using the fair value method 
we rely heavily on incentive compensation in the form of stock options to recruit  retain and motivate directors  executive officers  employees and consultants 
incentive compensation in the form of stock options is designed to provide long term incentives  develop and maintain an ownership stake and conserve cash during our development stage 
since inception through december  stock based compensation expense totaled  or approximately of our accumulated deficit 
we account for stock options and warrants granted to non employees based on the fair value of the stock option or warrant using the black scholes option pricing model based on assumptions for expected stock price volatility  expected term of the option  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield at the grant date 
the single most significant factor impacting our operating results is the price of our stock which is used in the computation of stock based compensation expense  particularly for variable options 
our stock price fluctuated from per share as of december  to per share as of december  as of december    of our non employee options required variable accounting treatment in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin 
our stock based compensation expense associated with these non employee variable options during the twelve months ended december  was  during the twelve months ended december  we recorded  of stock based compensation expense associated with these non employee variable options and we reversed  of this expense during the twelve month ended december  research and development we do not currently have any commercial biopharmaceutical products  and do not expect to have such for several years  if at all and therefore our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
these include expenditures in connection with an in house research and development laboratory  salaries and staff costs  application and filing for regulatory approval of our proposed products  purchase of in process research and development  regulatory and scientific consulting fees  contract research and royalty payments to outside suppliers  facilities and universities as well as legal and professional fees associated with filing and maintaining our patent and license rights to our proposed products 
while certain of our research and development costs may have future benefits  our policy of expensing all research and development expenditures is predicated on the fact that we have no history of successful commercialization of biopharmaceutical products to base any estimate of the number of future periods that would be benefited 
results of operations years ended december  and december  we had no revenues during the twelve months ended december  and because we do not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products and we do not expect to have such products for several years  if at all 
research and development expenses increased approximately  or  to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the single most significant factor contributing to this increase in research and development expense was our l annamycin project where our program expenses increased to approximately  during the twelve months ended december  we started our work on l annamycin in the latter part of  and incurred approximately  in expenses during the twelve months ended december   primarily limited to a  initial license fee   in patent related legal fees paid to the university of texas m 
d 
anderson cancer center and approximately  incurred with our clinical consultant to begin the process of developing protocols and obtaining investigational review board irb approvals to start our trials 
atiprimod clinical trial expenses which include patient costs  drug formulation and tableting  data collection  monitoring  insurance  and fda consultants increased approximately  or to approximately  during the twelve months ended december  as compared to approximately  for the twelve months ended december  also contributing to this increase in research and development expense in the twelve months ended december  were salaries and wages in the amount of  compared to  during the twelve months ended december   increasing approximately  or 
the increase was a result of hiring a chief medical officer  an in house patent agent and several clinical trial associates to manage our clinical activities 
stock based compensation research and development recorded during the twelve months ended december   totaled  as compared to  recorded during the twelve months ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the restructuring of dr 
kunwar m 
shailubhai s employment agreement during  which resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of approximately  during the twelve months ended december  see footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
government grant funding for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  our funding was for work on a biodefense partnership grant from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases to develop a monoclonal antibody and vaccine against bacterial superantigen toxins under our august  license with rockefeller university 
our funding was from a grant from the national institutes of health for studies on atiprimod 
we request grant funding to reimburse research and development expenses as incurred and this reimbursement has been reported on our consolidated statements of operations as a separate line item entitled government grant 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  an increase of  or  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase was due primarily to approximately i  of increased investor relations costs  ii  in higher consulting fees for strategic planning and capital markets advice  iii  in higher personnel expenses primarily employee group insurance  payroll taxes and recruitment fees associated with staffing growth and iv  in higher costs related to our work on compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of stock based compensation general and administrative recorded during the twelve months ended december   totaled  as compared to  recorded during the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the expense associated with warrants we issued to trilogy capital partners to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes methodology is  which is being recorded as stock based compensation expense over the twelve month term of the service agreement entered into on july  during the twelve months ended december  the amortization of the trilogy warrant stock based compensation totaled  purchased in process research and development was and  for the twelve months ended december  and respectively 
the expense was primarily in connection with the acquisition of rights to two key patents from houston pharmaceuticals  inc during december and synergy sold certain new jersey state tax loss carry forwards under a state economic development program for cash of approximately  and  respectively  the proceeds of which were used to support research and development activities in new jersey 
this state tax benefit was recorded as other income during the fourth quarters ended december  and as of december  we have no remaining new jersey state tax loss carry forwards available for sale 
net loss for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  reported for the twelve months ended december  the increased net loss is primarily the result of higher research  development  general and administrative expenses discussed above net of lower stock based compensation and purchased in process r d 
years ended december  and december  the results of operations of synergy are included in the consolidated statements of operations since the merger on april  we had no revenues during the twelve months ended december  and because we do not have any commercial biopharmaceutical products and we do not expect to have such products for several years  if at all 
research and development expenses increased approximately  or  to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the single most significant factor contributing to this increase in research and development expense was approximately  in higher costs associated with the commencement of our phase i iia clinical trials of atiprimod in may of these clinical trial expenses included patient costs  drug formulation and tableting  data collection  monitoring  insurance  and fda consultants 
during the twelve months ended december  our atiprimod project expenses were pre clinical in nature  associated with preparing our ind application 
also contributing to this increase in research and development expense in the twelve months ended december  were our payments of the first annual  maintenance fee to anormed  inc for the atiprimod license 
in addition personnel costs increased approximately  as we retained two synergy executive staff scientists  drs 
picker and shailubhai  subsequent to the merger and we incurred  of costs to develop a new gmp certified commercial production capacity for future trials of atiprimod 
the remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to  of higher expenses paid to outside collaborating institutions under our government research grant for atiprimod 
our l annamycin project  which started in the latter part of  incurred expenses primarily limited to a  initial license fee and  in patent related legal fees paid to the university of texas md anderson cancer center and approximately  incurred with our clinical consultant to begin the process of developing protocols and obtaining investigational review board irb approvals to start our trials 
until the latter part of our lead drug candidate was atiprimod and almost all of our resources were devoted to that project 
concurrently with the license of l annamycin we began implementing a project cost management system which became effective january  this system captures all of our outside variable project cost eg patient costs  drug formulation and tableting  data collection  monitoring  insurance  and fda consultants associated with the clinical development of each of our drug candidates 
with regard to our relatively fixed and smaller research and development overhead expenses  principally salaries and facilities  we are not able to accurately and meaningfully determine project allocations at this time 
we do believe however that these internal fixed resources are expended on projects approximately in proportion to our outside variable costs 
stock based compensation research and development recorded during the twelve months ended december   totaled  as compared to  recorded during the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to restructuring of dr 
kunwar m 
shailubhai s employment agreement  which resulted in deferred compensation cost associated with  cancelled options of  as of the date of cancellation being charged to stock based compensation expense during the twelve months ended december  see footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition our stock based compensation research and development recorded during the twelve months ended december  reflects a full twelve months of expense attributable to options granted to our scientific staff at mid year subsequent to the merger with synergy in april government grant funding for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to for the twelve months ended december  we request grant funding to reimburse research and development expenses as incurred 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  an increase of  or  from  for the twelve months ended december  the increase was due primarily to approximately i  of increased personnel costs principally as a result of the merger and recruitment costs related to hiring personnel  ii  in higher facilities and office overhead related to the move into our new corporate headquarters in new york city during the quarter ended december   iii  in higher outside services associated with being a public company including outside directors  transfer agent fees and investor relations and iv  in higher business travel principally attending investor  professional and medical conferences in the united states  england  italy and germany 
stock based compensation general and administrative recorded during the twelve months ended december   totaled  as compared to  recorded during the twelve months ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in our stock price from as of december  to per share as of december  this share price decrease resulted in the recapture during of stock based compensation recorded on certain variable options granted to non employees during the stock based compensation expense associated with these variable options during the twelve months ended december  was  whereas we reversed  of this expense during the twelve months ended december  purchased in process research and development was  for the twelve months ended december   primarily in connection with the acquisition of rights to two key patents covering a novel cancer platform technology from houston pharmaceuticals  inc during the twelve months ended december  we recorded  of purchased in process research and development expense in connection with the merger 
during december and  synergy sold certain new jersey state tax loss carry forwards under a state economic development program for cash of approximately  and  respectively  the proceeds of which were used to support research and development activities in new jersey 
this state tax benefit was recorded as other income during the fourth quarters ended december  and net loss for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  incurred for the twelve months ended december  the decreased net loss is primarily the result of the lower purchased in process research and development expenses  partially offset by higher research  development  general and administrative expenses discussed above 
in addition we recorded lower stock based compensation expense of  during the twelve months ended december   as compared to  recorded during the same period ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to  as of december  this decrease in cash of  during the twelve months ended december  was principally the result of cash used in operating activities of  during the twelve months ended december  cash used in operating activities was primarily for research and development and general and administrative expenses discussed above  partially offset by government grant funding  the sale of tax loss carry forwards and interest and investment income 
we financed these net operating cash expenditures from existing cash balances  by completing two private placements of common stock yielding net proceeds of  and from the exercise of common stock warrants totaling on february   we closed a private placement of  shares of common stock and  common stock purchase warrants to certain accredited investors 
the warrants are exercisable for months from closing at an exercise price of per share 
the securities were sold at a price of per share for aggregate proceeds of  we paid an aggregate  and issued an aggregate  warrants to certain selling agents 
the selling agent warrants are exercisable at per share and will expire three years after closing 
we also incurred  in legal fees directly associated with the closing 
the net proceed were from this private placement were  on august   we closed a private placement of  shares of common stock to certain of our existing stockholders 
the shares were sold at a price of per share for aggregate proceeds of approximately million 
we paid an aggregate  to certain selling agents 
on march  we sold and issued in a private placement an aggregate  shares of common stock at a per share price of  for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
because this transaction was completed with certain existing institutional shareholders and certain members of our management we paid no fees to selling agents  and legal fees were  on april  we were awarded a biodefense partnership grant from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid to develop a monoclonal antibody and vaccine against bacterial superantigen toxins  in the amount of  over two years 
work on the niaid superantigen grant started in july and funding totaled  during the twelve months ended december  our capital resources are focused primarily on the clinical development and regulatory approval of l annamycin for acute leukemia and atiprimod for multiple myeloma  advanced carcinoid cancer  and bone resorption disease  a major complication associated with multiple myeloma 
our product development efforts are thus in their early stages and we cannot make estimates of the costs or the time it will take to complete 
the risk of completion of any program is high because of the long duration of clinical testing  extended regulatory approval and review cycles and uncertainty of the costs 
net cash inflows from any products developed may take several years to achieve 
we will need additional funding to complete these activities 
we could however receive grants  contracts or technology licenses in the short term 
the amount and timing of these inflows  if any  is not known 
our consolidated financial statements as of december  have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the year ending december  our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report dated march  that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing  attain further operating efficiencies and  ultimately  to generate revenue 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we will be required to raise additional capital within the next year to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates and to continue to fund operations at the current cash expenditure levels 
to date  our sources of cash have been primarily limited to the sale of our equity securities 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience significant dilution 
any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct our business 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms  we may have to significantly delay  scale back or discontinue the development and or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates 
we also may be required to seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available  and relinquish license or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves on unfavorable terms 
our current plan of operations envisions expenditures that will require additional funding  and we have developed a contingency plan reflecting scaled back operations which uses only existing resources to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and commitments the following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of december   and is based on information appearing in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total less than year years years more than years operating leases facilities purchase obligation principally consulting services minimum spending obligations license royalty payments total obligations we have licensed patents from other companies and institutions under certain license agreements 
this line item represents our minimum obligations to spend monies for product development and commercialization as set forth in each license 
this line item represents our minimum license fee payments to i anormed  inc for our atiprimod license  ii the university of texas md anderson cancer center for our degrasyns license and iii rockefeller university for the license of several patents related to our superantigen based bioterrorism defense program 
our patent license agreements also include milestone royalty payments to be paid in cash upon the achievement of certain regulatory approval and product commercialization goals 
these milestone payments have not been estimated because of the uncertainty surrounding the duration of on going early stage clinical trials and the extent of regulatory approval and review cycles 
since inception we have never achieved regulatory approval of any of our proposed products and we do not currently have any commercial biopharmaceutical products  and do not expect to have such for several years 
see footnote to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the terms of our license agreements for purposes of this schedule we have assumed that all patents not commercialized within years will be abandoned  license agreements will be terminated and associated minimum license fee payments will cease 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  share based payments sfas r 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the expense will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas r also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the award 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  and accordingly callisto adopted this standard on january  this statement does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees as set forth in sfas and eitf accounting for equity instruments issued to other than employees  for acquiring  or in connection with selling goods or services 
sfas r provides for two transition methods 
the modified prospective method requires that share based compensation expense be recorded for any employee options granted after the adoption date and for the unvested portion of any employee options outstanding as of the adoption date
