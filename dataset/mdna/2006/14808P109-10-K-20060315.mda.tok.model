this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report 
executive overview cass information systems  inc provides payment and information processing services to large manufacturing  distribution and retail enterprises from its processing centers in st 
louis  missouri  columbus  ohio  boston  massachusetts and greenville  south carolina 
the company s services include freight invoice rating  payment processing  auditing  and the generation of accounting and transportation information 
cass also processes and pays utility invoices  which includes electricity  gas and telecommunications expenses and is a provider of telecom expense management solutions 
cass extracts  stores and presents information from freight  utility and telecommunication invoices  assisting its customers transportation  energy and information technology managers in making decisions that will enable them to improve operating performance 
the company receives data from multiple sources  electronic and otherwise  and processes the data to accomplish the specific operating requirements of its customers 
it then provides the data in a central repository for access and archiving 
the data is finally transformed into information through the company s databases that allow client interaction as required and provide internet based tools for analytical processing 
the company also  through cass commercial bank  its st 
louis  missouri based bank subsidiary  provides banking services in the st 
louis metropolitan area  orange county  california and other selected cities in the united states 
in addition to supporting the company s payment operations  the bank provides banking services to its target markets  which include privately owned businesses and churches and church related ministries 
the specific payment and information processing services provided to each customer are developed individually to meet each customer s requirements which can vary greatly 
in addition  the degree of automation such as electronic data interchange edi  imaging  and web based solutions varies greatly among customers and industries 
these factors combine so that pricing varies greatly among the customer base 
in general  however  cass is compensated for its processing services through service fees and account balances that are generated during the payment process 
the amount  type and calculation of service fees vary greatly by service offering  but generally follow the volume of transactions processed 
interest income from the balances generated during the payment processing cycle is affected by the amount of time cass holds the funds prior to payment and the dollar volume processed 
both the number of transactions processed and the dollar volume processed are therefore key metrics followed by management 
other factors will also influence revenue and profitability  such as changes in the general level of interest rates which have a significant effect on net interest income 
the funds generated by these processing activities are invested in overnight investments  investment grade securities and loans generated by the bank 
the bank earns most of its revenue from net interest income  or the difference between the interest earned on its loans and investments and the interest expense on its deposits 
the bank also assesses fees on other services such as cash management services 
industry wide factors that impact the company include the acceptance by large corporations of the outsourcing of key business functions such as freight  utility and telecommunication payment and audit 
the benefits that can be achieved by outsourcing transaction processing and the management information generated by cass systems can be influenced by factors such as the competitive pressures within industries to improve profitability  the general level of transportation costs  deregulation of energy costs and consolidation of telecommunication providers 
economic factors that impact the company include the general level of economic activity that can affect the volume and size of invoices processed  the ability to hire and retain qualified staff and the growth and quality of the loan portfolio 
the general level of interest rates also has a significant effect on the revenue of the company 
on december   the company s bank subsidiary sold the operating assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  government e management solutions  inc gems  to n 
harris computer corporation for  resulting in a pre tax gain of  including this gain  gems net loss for was  the assets  liabilities and operating results of gems have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods 
gems developed and sold proprietary financial  human resource and revenue management software to government entities 
gems was acquired on january  when the company s bank subsidiary foreclosed on the operating assets of a software company in order to protect its financial interests 
as part of the company s year end closing procedures  the company performed a valuation of its minority equity interest in a private imaging company 
this investment was made in to acquire imaging technology for the company s payment operations 
the business has performed poorly during the past few years and the majority owner is in the process of implementing a new business plan 
based on the current and projected operating losses of this entity  the company recognized a  impairment charge on its investment 
as of december  the company s remaining financial interest in this entity was a  interest in a secured line of credit participated with the entity s majority owner for working capital purposes 
the company had an excellent year in surpassing management s expectations 
total fee revenue and other income from continuing operations increased  or and net interest income increased  or while increases in total operating expenses were held to  or 
this increase in operating expenses also includes the august acquisition of cass telecom group 
these results were driven by a  or increase in items processed   or increase in dollars processed and strong expense control combined with a rise in the general level of interest rates 
the disposition of gems and the  impairment charge further strengthened the company s balance sheet 
the asset quality of the company s loans and investments remains strong 
currently  management views cass major opportunity and challenge as the continued expansion of its payment and information processing service offerings and customer base 
management intends to accomplish this by maintaining the company s lead in applied technology  which  when combined with the security and processing controls of the bank  makes cass unique in the industry 
this trend has been positive over the past years and management anticipates that this should continue in the general level of interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  began to increase in and continued through if rates continue to rise  the positive impact on net interest income and net earnings will continue 
management intends to continue to refine its risk management practices  monitor and manage the quality of the loan portfolio and maintain a strong financial and liquidity position 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this report in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates have been generally accurate in the past  have been consistent and have not required any material changes 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and are described below 
allowance for loan losses 
the company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
although these estimates are based on established methodologies for determining allowance requirements  actual results can differ significantly from estimated results 
these policies affect both segments of the company 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed in the allowance and provision for loan losses section of this report 
impairment of assets 
the company periodically evaluates certain long term assets such as intangible assets including goodwill  foreclosed assets  internally developed software and investments in private equity securities for impairment 
generally  these assets are initially recorded at cost  and recognition of impairment is required when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets will not be recoverable in the future 
if impairment occurs  various methods of measuring impairment may be called for depending on the circumstances and type of asset  including quoted market prices  estimates based on similar assets  and estimates based on valuation techniques such as discounted projected cash flows 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
these policies affect both segments of the company and require significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different results if conditions or underlying circumstances change 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns such as the realization of deferred tax assets  changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  the company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
a change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters could materially impact its consolidated financial statements

this increase was driven mainly by the expansion of the company s customer base and number of services offered 
it is the company s strategy to expand processing revenue by actively marketing the company s existing product lines in freight  utility  and telecom payment and processing  expanding the company s service offerings to the markets currently served and expanding into new markets by leveraging its payment and processing capabilities 
the august acquisition of cass telecom group was part of this strategy 
this acquisition  although not yet accretive to earnings  significantly increased the company s audit and telecom expense management capabilities 
net interest income after provision for loan losses increased  due primarily to an increase in the general level of interest rates 
the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was in compared to in another significant contributor to the increase in net interest income was a  increase in average earning assets 
the growth in average earning assets was funded mainly by increases in accounts and drafts payable due to the increase in dollars processed 
gains from the sale of securities decreased  to  compared to last year s  bank service fees decreased  or to  due primarily to the fact that as the earnings credit rate granted customers on their account balances increases with the general level of interest rates  the amount of service fees charged decreases 
other income from continuing operations remained fairly constant   in and  in excluding the  impairment charge relating to the company s investment in a private imaging company  operating expenses from continuing operations increased  due mainly to expenses relating to the increase in processing activity along with the additional expenses related to the telecom group which was acquired in august in addition to the factors above relating to the results of continuing operations  net income  diluted earnings per share  return on assets and return on equity were also affected by a  net loss from gems discontinued operations which includes a  gain on the sale of its operating assets 
the results of compared to include the following significant items payment and processing fee revenue from continuing operations increased  as the number of transactions processed increased  this increase was driven by the expansion of the company s customer base and number of services offered 
net interest income after provision for loan losses increased  due primarily to the increase in average earning assets of  this increase included an increase in total average loans of  the growth in average earning assets was derived from both increases in deposits and accounts and drafts payable 
interest income  derived from the increase in earning assets  was partially offset by an increase in interest paid on deposit liabilities  due to both an increase in balances and an increase in rates paid

summary of fourth quarter results the positive trends in fee revenue  net interest income and net income that existed in continued during the fourth quarter 
net operating results  however  were also affected by two other significant events 
the first was the sale of the operating assets of gems on december  and the second was the impairment of the company s equity investment in a private imaging company 
the sale of gems operating assets resulted in a pre tax gain of  including this gain  gems net income was  in the fourth quarter and these results are reflected as discontinued operations 
net income from continuing operations before taxes was reduced  due to the impairment charge 
for more detail refer to item  notes  and fee revenue and other income from continuing operations the company s fee revenue is derived mainly from freight and utility payment and processing fees 
as the company provides its processing and payment services  it is compensated by service fees which are typically calculated on a per item basis and by the accounts and drafts payable balances generated in the payment process which can be used to generate interest income 
processing volumes related to fees and accounts and drafts payable for the years ended december   and were as follows december  change in thousands v v freight invoice transaction volume    
freight invoice dollar volume    utility transaction volume    utility transaction dollar volume    payment and processing revenue    bank service fees    gains on sales of investment securities   other fee revenue and other income in compared to include the following significant pre tax components freight transaction volume increased  during the past year 
this increase was due mainly to the assimilation of a significant amount of new business in and the continuation of a strong business climate for many companies in the customer base 
in addition to these factors  higher dollar volume during the last three years has been affected by higher dollars per shipment due to escalating fuel costs 
utility volume also experienced solid growth  adding more than  transactions in this growth was due mainly to new business 
while new business grew about the same rate as in the past  the company was negatively impacted by the loss of two high transaction customers  which accounted for a decrease of  transactions 
the loss of these two customers was not material from a profitability standpoint 
the higher rate of growth in utility dollars compared to utility volume was due to the conversion of a large customer to payables from data entry only  an increasing market share in the industrial vertical market which generates higher dollars per bill and higher commodity costs that raise the average dollars per bill 
these transaction volume increases drove most of the  increase in payment and processing revenue 
the telecom group  which was acquired in august  contributed  of payment and processing fees for and  in bank service fees decreased  during this time period 
this decrease was due primarily to the fact that service fees decrease as the credit allowance for non interest bearing deposits increases  due to the general level of interest rate increases 
during the company recorded net gains of  on the sales of securities 
during  net gains of  were recorded on the sales of securities 
these securities sales were made to adjust the portfolio to reflect the changes in the interest rate environment  growth in the loan portfolio during the past two years and to offset the loss of interest income due to the dramatic decline in the general level of interest rates 
other miscellaneous income increased  from fee revenue and other income in compared to include the following significant pre tax components freight transaction volume increased slightly due mainly to increased activity from existing clients 
there was also a change in mix from lower priced  simple transactions to higher priced  complex transactions 
total dollar volume processed from this division increased during this period due to increased activity from existing clients and larger average freight charges 
fees for the period grew due to the increased volume and additional services provided 
the increase in volume and fees from the utility division increased primarily due to new customers as the growth of this segment continues 
the acquisition of the telecom group in august  contributed  of payment and processing fees in bank service fees decreased  during the year

these securities sales were made to adjust the portfolio to reflect the changes in the interest rate environment  growth in the loan portfolio during the prior two years and to offset the loss of interest income due to the dramatic decline in the general level of interest rates 
other income decreased  during this period 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income recognized from the increase in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance purchased by the company in net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans  investments  and other earning assets and interest expense on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is a significant source of the company s revenues

v 
average earning assets    net interest income    net interest margin yield on earning assets rate on interest bearing liabilities net interest income in compared to the increase in net interest income was caused by the combination of a significant increase in earning assets combined with a significant increase in net interest margin 
the increase in earning assets was funded mainly by the increase in accounts and drafts payable due to the increased dollars processed 
the increase in net interest margin was due mainly to the rise in the general level of interest rates and also the increase in the size of the loan portfolio 
loans are the company s highest yielding earning asset for any given maturity 
the company is positively affected by increases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  the company is negatively affected by decreases in the level of interest rates 
this is primarily due to the non interest bearing liabilities generated by the company in the form of accounts and drafts payable 
more information is contained in the tables below and in item a of this report

average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased from to as the general level of interest rates increased 
net interest income in compared to the increase in net interest income was caused by the significant increase in earning assets that exceeded the decline in net interest margin

the company is negatively affected by decreases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  the company is positively affected by increases in the level of interest rates 
this is primarily due to the noninterest bearing liabilities generated by the company in the form of accounts and drafts payable 
despite the slight increase in interest rates during the second half of the net interest margin was lower than in due to the decreases over the prior few years and the fact that changes in interest rates affect some earning assets such as federal funds sold and floating rate loans immediately  and some earning assets such as fixed rate loans and municipal bonds over time 
this decrease in net interest margin was also negatively impacted by an increase in rates paid on deposits

the company has no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans  which are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table and discussed in item  note of this report 
as can be seen in the loan composition table above and discussed in item  note  the company s primary market niche for banking services is privately held businesses and churches and church related ministries 
loans to commercial entities are generally secured by the business assets of the borrower  including accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  and the real estate from which the borrower operates 
operating lines of credit to these companies generally are secured by accounts receivable and inventory  with specific percentages of each determined on a customer by customer basis based on various factors including the type of business 
intermediate term credit for machinery and equipment is generally provided at some percentage of the value of the equipment purchased  depending on the type of machinery or equipment purchased by the entity 
loans secured exclusively by real estate to businesses and churches are generally made with a maximum loan to value ratio  depending upon the company s estimate of the resale value and ability of the property to generate cash 
the company s loan policy requires an independent appraisal for all loans over  secured by real estate 
company management monitors the local economy in an attempt to determine whether it has had a significant deteriorating effect on such real estate credits 
when problems are identified  appraised values are updated on a continual basis  either internally or through an updated external appraisal 
loan portfolio changes from december  to december  total loans increased  or to  this increase was due to both the expansion of church and church related loans located throughout the country and commercial and construction loans in the st 
louis metropolitan area 
at year end  church and church related real estate and construction credits totaled  which represents a increase over additional details regarding the types and maturities of loans in the loan portfolio are contained in the tables above and in item  note loan portfolio changes from december  to december  total loans increased  or to  this increase was due mainly to the expansion of church and church related loans in the st

the amount of the provision will fluctuate as determined by these quarterly analyses

of outstanding loans 
nonperforming loans are more fully explained in the section entitled nonperforming assets 
the allowance for loan losses has been established and is maintained to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing assessment of risk of loss is performed to determine if the current balance of the allowance is adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
a charge or credit is made to expense to cover any deficiency or reduce any excess 
the current methodology employed to determine the appropriate allowance consists of two components  specific and general 
the company develops specific valuation allowances on commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans based on individual review of these loans and an estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and collection options available 
the general component relates to all other loans  which are evaluated based on loan grade 
the loan grade assigned to each loan is typically evaluated on an annual basis  unless circumstances require interim evaluation 
the company assigns a reserve amount consistent with each loan s rating category 
the reserve amount is based on derived loss experience over prescribed periods 
in addition to the amounts derived from the loan grades  a portion is added to the general reserve to take into account other factors including national and local economic conditions  downturns in specific industries including loss in collateral value  trends in credit quality at the company and the banking industry  and trends in risk rating changes 
as part of their examination process  federal and state agencies review the company s methodology for maintaining the allowance for loan losses and the balance in the account 
these agencies may require the company to increase the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and interpretations about information available to them at the time of their examination

the remaining loans are closely monitored by management and have specific reserves established for the estimated loss exposure 
the company does not have any foreign loans 
the company s loan portfolio does not include a significant amount of single family real estate mortgage or installment credits  as the company does not market its services to retail customers

amortization of intangibles increased from to  due to the intangibles acquired in the acquisition of the cass telecom group in august other operating expenses decreased  or to  this decrease was influenced by many factors including a decrease of  in postage and supply expense related to the increase in electronic processing in the information services division 
advertising and business development expense decreased  and professional fees decreased  due to the timing of these activities 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in expenses related to the acquisition of the cass telecom group and an increase of  in outside service fees  which includes fees related to the additional procedures required under section of the sarbanes oxley act and an increase in outside imaging expenses

deposits and accounts and drafts payable noninterest bearing demand deposits increased  or from december  to  at december  the average balances of these deposits decreased  or from december  to  at december  the increase in ending balances relates mainly to normal daily fluctuations in these accounts 
these balances are mainly maintained by commercial customers and churches and can fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
therefore  management believes that average balances are a more meaningful measure of deposit trends 
interest bearing deposits decreased  or from december  to  at december  the average balances of these deposits remained fairly constant at  in to  in accounts and drafts payable generated by the company in its payment processing operations increased  or from december  to  at december  the average balances of these funds increased  or from to  in these increases relate to the increase in dollars processed 
due to the company s payment processing cycle  average balances are much more indicative of the underlying activity than period end balances since point in time comparisons can be misleading if the comparison dates fall on different days of the week 
the composition of average deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits is represented in the table entitled distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  interest rate and interest differential which is included earlier in this discussion

liquidity the discipline of liquidity management as practiced by the company seeks to ensure that funds are available to fulfill all payment obligations relating to invoices processed as they become due  meet depositor withdrawal requests and borrower credit demands while at the same time maximizing profitability 
this is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in supply of funds 
primary liquidity to meet demand is provided by short term liquid assets that can be converted to cash  maturing securities and the ability to obtain funds from external sources 
the company s asset liability committee alco has direct oversight responsibility for the company s liquidity position and profile 
management considers both on balance sheet and off balance sheet items in its evaluation of liquidity 
the balances of liquid assets consists of cash and cash equivalents  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  and money market funds  and were  at december   an increase of  or from december  at december  these assets represented of total assets 
these funds are the company s and its subsidiaries primary source of liquidity to meet future expected and unexpected loan demand  depositor withdrawals or reductions in accounts and drafts payable 
secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing lines 
total investment in debt securities available for sale at fair value was  at december   an increase of  or from december  these assets represented of total assets at december  of this total  were state and political subdivision securities  were us treasury securities  and were us government agencies

the bank has unsecured lines of credit at correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up to a maximum of  additionally  the bank maintains lines of credit at unaffiliated financial institutions in the maximum amount of  collateralized by us treasury and agency securities and commercial and residential mortgage loans 
the deposits of the company s banking subsidiary have historically been stable  consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that utilize many other commercial products of the bank 
the accounts and drafts payable generated by the company have also historically been a stable source of funds 
the company also maintains a treasury stock buyback program pursuant to which the board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
the company repurchased  shares during for  the company did not repurchase any shares during as of december    shares remained available for repurchase under the program 
repurchases are made in the open market or through negotiated transactions from time to time depending on market conditions 
net cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the years  and were   and  respectively 
net income plus the adjustment for depreciation and amortization accounts for most of the operating cash provided 
net cash flows from investing and financing activities fluctuate greatly as the company actively manages its investment and loan portfolios and customer activity influences changes in deposit and accounts and drafts payable balances 
further analysis of the changes in these account balances is discussed earlier in this report 
due to the daily fluctuations in these account balances  management believes that the analysis of changes in average balances  also discussed earlier in this report  can be more indicative of underlying activity than the period end balances used in the statements of cash flows 
management anticipates that cash and cash equivalents  maturing investments and cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital expenditures in capital resources one of management s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base to warrant the confidence of customers  shareholders  and bank regulatory agencies 
a strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors 
the company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory capital requirements  as evidenced by the capital ratios at december  as shown in item  note of this report 
in  cash dividends paid were 
per share for a total of  a increase over the prior year  which is attributable to an increase in the per share amount paid and additional shares outstanding 
on august   the company declared a stock dividend payable to holders of record on september  on february  the company declared a stock dividend payable to holders of record on march  shareholders equity was  or of total assets  at december   an increase of  over the balance at december  this increase resulted from net income of  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and other items of  which was partially offset by cash dividends paid of  repurchase of shares of  a decrease in other comprehensive income of  and other items of  related to the stock dividend 
dividends from the bank subsidiary are a significant source of funds for payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
the only restrictions on dividends are those dictated by regulatory capital requirements and prudent and sound banking principles 
as of december   unappropriated retained earnings of  were available at the bank for the declaration of dividends to the company without prior approval from regulatory authorities 
commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company is party to activities that contain credit  market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such activities include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments and commitments under operating and capital leases 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
the company s maximum potential exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments 
at december   no amounts have been accrued for any estimated losses for these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company or its subsidiaries to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
these off balance sheet financial instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
at december  the balance of loan commitments  commercial and standby letters of credit were   and  respectively 
since some of the financial instruments may expire without being drawn upon  the total amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting standards as those financial instruments included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary upon extension of the credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral held varies  but is generally accounts receivable  inventory  residential or income producing commercial property or equipment 
in the event of nonperformance  the company or its subsidiaries may obtain and liquidate the collateral to recover amounts paid under its guarantees on these financial instruments

during  the company contributed  to its noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
the contribution had no significant effect on the company s overall liquidity 
in determining pension expense  the company makes several assumptions  including the discount rate and long term rate of return on assets 
these assumptions are determined at the beginning of the plan year based on interest rate levels and financial market performance 
for these assumptions were as follows weighted average discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels expected long term rate of return on assets effect of recent and prospective accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and its fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management discipline as applied by the company seeks to limit the volatility  to the extent possible  of both net interest income and the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in market interest rates 
this is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate investments  loans  and deposits  matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to the extent possible  and optimizing the mix of fees and net interest income 
however  as discussed below  the company s asset liability position differs significantly from most other bank holding companies with significant positive cumulative gaps shown for each time horizon presented 
this asset sensitive position is caused primarily by the operations of the company  which generate large balances of accounts and drafts payable 
these balances  which are noninterest bearing  contribute to the company s historical high net interest margin but cause the company to become susceptible to changes in interest rates  with a decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of rising interest rates 
the company s alco measures the company s interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage the variability of earnings and fair market value of equity in various interest rate environments 
the alco evaluates the company s risk position to determine whether the level of exposure is significant enough to hedge a potential decline in earnings and value or whether the company can safely increase risk to enhance returns 
the alco uses gap reports  twelve month net interest income simulations  and fair market value of equity analyses as its main analytical tools to provide management with insight into the company s exposure to changing interest rates 
management uses a gap report to review any significant mismatch between the re pricing points of the company s rate sensitive assets and liabilities in certain time horizons 
a negative gap indicates that more liabilities re price in that particular time frame and  if rates rise  these liabilities will re price faster than the assets 
a positive gap would indicate the opposite 
gap reports can be misleading in that they capture only the re pricing timing within the balance sheet  and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
basis risk involves the potential for the spread relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the level and or timing of cash flows given changes in rates 
another measurement tool used by management is net interest income simulation  which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve months under different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential changes in short term accounting income 
management has set policy limits specifying acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate movements 
these simulations are more informative than gap reports because they are able to capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet  such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
a table containing simulation results as of december  from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates is shown below 
while net interest income simulations do an adequate job of capturing interest rate risk to short term earnings  they do not capture risk within the current balance sheet beyond twelve months 
the company uses fair market value of equity analyses to help identify longer term risk that may reside on the current balance sheet 
the fair market value of equity is represented by the present value of all future income streams generated by the current balance sheet 
the company measures the fair market value of equity as the net present value of all asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward rates suggested by the current treasury curve plus appropriate credit spreads 
this representation of the change in the fair market value of equity under different rate scenarios gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes 
management has set policy limits relating to declines in the market value of equity
