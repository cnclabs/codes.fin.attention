overview we design  manufacture and sell next generation broadband access communications equipment to wireline and wireless communications carriers 
we were incorporated in september as a successor company to koenig communications  inc  equipment systems integration and consulting company that had been in operation since in the summer of  we ceased our systems integration and consulting business and commenced our main product sales with the commercial deployment of our first network access products  which was followed by the introduction of our wide bank products in november  access navigator products in january  adit products in december  the broadmore products in october  which we acquired from litton network access systems  inc  and the axxius products in june in november  we acquired the master series and broadway product lines through our acquisition of paragon networks international  inc during the late s  a substantial number of carriers  including clecs  invested heavily in network infrastructure and service delivery projects  which accelerated growth in the telecommunications equipment market 
by  when our annual net revenues reached million  we relied on a limited number of clecs for a significant portion of our net revenue 
however  starting in late  many of these clecs encountered sharp declines in the amount of capital they had available to fund network infrastructure and service delivery projects 
as a result  there was a significant decline in the demand for telecommunications equipment  including demand for our products 

table of contents we have since broadened our product portfolio into new markets  including wireless carriers and incumbent wireline carriers 
for example  in  approximately of our net revenue was derived from clecs  from ilecs  and from wireless carriers compared to approximately  and  respectively  in currently  the wireless and ilec markets are dominated by a small number of large companies  and we continue to rely upon a small number of customers in these markets for a significant portion of our revenue 
for the year ended december   direct sales to cingular accounted for approximately of our total net revenues 
for the year ended december   direct sales to two customers each accounted for over of our revenue ericsson accounted for approximately and t mobile accounted for approximately 
when the downturn in the telecommunications industry adversely affected our net revenue and operating results in late  we reduced our operating expenses in an effort to better position our business for the long term 
in december  we completed a restructuring plan designed to reduce our expenses and align our workforce and operations to be more in line with anticipated net revenues 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recorded a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of this charge was comprised of million for future rent payments related to facility closures and downsizing and  for salary related expenses due to reductions in our workforce 
our objective has been to focus on cost controls while continuing to invest in the development of new and enhanced products  which we believe will position us to take advantage of sales opportunities as economic conditions improve and demand recovers  a trend that we started to see in and the first half of however  we believe current economic conditions and industry consolidation may continue to cause our customers and potential customers to defer and reduce capital spending 
historically  most of the sales of our products have been through a limited number of distributors and oems 
walker associates accounted for in  in and in recently  however  an increasing proportion of our products sales have been made directly to telecommunications carriers and oems 
for the year ended december   direct sales to cingular accounted for approximately or our net revenues 
during the year ended december   ericsson  an oem  accounted for of net revenue  and we sold directly to a carrier  t mobile  who accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
we expect that the sale of our products will continue to be made to a small  and increasingly concentrated  number of distributors  oems  and direct customers 
as a result  the loss of  or reduction of sales to  any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
international net revenues  or net revenues on products shipped outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our total net revenues in for  and  respectively 
however  we are targeting specific international market distribution in and we believe that an increasing proportion of our net revenues will be from international customers in the future 
our net revenues continue to be affected by the timing and number of orders for our products  which continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to factors such as demand for our products  economic conditions  and the financial stability and ordering patterns of our direct customers  distributors  and oems 
in addition  a significant portion of our net revenues has been derived from a limited number of large orders  and we believe that this trend will continue in the future  especially if the percentage of oem and direct sales to customers continues to increase since such customers typically place larger orders than our distributors 
the timing of such orders and our ability to fulfill them has caused material fluctuations in our operating results  and we anticipate that such fluctuations will continue in the future 
as more fully described in item a of this annual report on form k  as of december   our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal controls over certain aspects of our financial reporting due to material weaknesses in internal controls pertaining to the preparation of our consolidated statements of cash flows  evaluations of customer arrangements for appropriate recognition of revenue for our products  accounting for inventory reserves  and a lack of personnel with sufficient technical accounting expertise to identify and account for complex transactions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
as a result of these internal control deficiencies  we amended our annual reports on form k form k a for the year ended december  to amend and restate our consolidated financial statements and related financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and the form k a also included restated quarterly information for each of the quarters within the fiscal years ended december  and  to reflect the appropriate accounting for these items 
during the year ended december   we implemented improvements to our internal control over financial reporting which we believe adequately remediates each of these material weaknesses and establishes adequate internal controls over our financial reporting 
these remediations are more fully described in item a of this annual report on form k 
presentation the analysis is organized in a way that provides the information required  while highlighting the information that we believe will be instructive for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
in addition to the discussion of the historical information that reviews the current reporting presentation of our consolidated financial statements  an overview of the operational results is provided below 

table of contents results of operations for the three years ended december  the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated in thousands of revenues of revenues of revenues net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit research and development sales and marketing expense general and administrative bad debt expense recoveries restructuring charges intangible asset amortization income loss from operations interest income other income  net income loss from operations before income taxes income taxes benefit net income loss the decrease in net revenues in from was primarily due to decreases in the number of units sold into the wireless market  in particular our adit  axxius  broadway and wide bank products 
we believe that the decrease was due to consolidation within the wireless industry  such as the merger between at t wireless and cingular  and spectrum sales to t mobile as our wireless customers were rationalizing their networks  combined with a decrease in legacy wireline adit sales to clec customers 
the increase in net revenue in was due to increases in the number of units sold into the wireless market 
we believe that the increase in units sold in was due to the deployment by some wireless carriers of our axxius  adit and masterseries products to comply with fcc mandated e location services and to expand cell site bandwidth capacity for new data service offerings by wireless mobility carriers 
our net revenue also improved due to the continued economic recovery and lessening of capital market constraints in the telecommunications sector in compared to the acquisition of paragon in november contributed to the increase in wireless market revenue  primarily because of our masterseries product 
a significant portion of our net revenue has been derived from a limited number of large orders  and we believe that this trend will continue in the future  especially if the percentage of direct sales to end users increases 
in  and  approximately of our net revenues were derived from   and customer sales orders  respectively 
we have experienced a substantial decrease in the number of orders from some of these customers as a result of decreases in their capital spending budgets and the impact of adverse economic conditions both in general and in the telecommunications equipment industry in particular  which has resulted in decreased demand for telecommunications equipment during this period 
in order to maintain or grow our net revenue  as well as offset the loss of anticipated net revenue from some of our prior customers  we will need to sell more products to both our remaining customers and new customers  and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to make such sales 
our net revenue was  and continues to be  affected by the timing and quantities of orders for our products which may vary from quarter to quarter in the future  as they have in the past  due to factors such as demand for our products  economic conditions  bankruptcies of our customers and distributors  and ordering patterns of distributors and oems  and other direct customers 
we believe that this trend could continue in the future  especially if the percentage of direct sales to end users increases 
the timing of customer orders and our ability to fulfill them can cause material fluctuations in our operating results  and we anticipate that such fluctuations will occur in the future 
gross profit year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands gross profit of net revenues gross profit decreases in relative to resulted primarily from lower sales volumes  lower average selling prices for certain legacy wireline products  and the impact of higher fixed manufacturing overhead costs per unit 
in addition  gross margins were impacted by shifts in product mix to lower margin products including our adit and axxius products 
our gross profit was approximately unchanged relative to reflecting product mix changes to higher margin products and product cost reductions from higher production volumes  which were offset in part by decreases in selling prices 
in addition  we finalized our integration with paragon  which resulted in the disposal of inventory carried at  that reduced gross profit that would otherwise have been reported absent the disposal by 
we believe that average selling prices and the related gross profit margins will decline for our mature products as volume price discounts in distributor contracts and direct sales relationships take effect due to competition 
we experienced declines in average selling prices per unit for our masterseries  navigator and adit products in  and in our axxius  navigator and wide bank products during in addition  new product introductions could harm our gross profit margins due to lower absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead costs per unit until production volumes increase 

table of contents we include direct and indirect materials and labor  certain warehousing and other allocable fixed manufacturing overhead costs  including depreciation  in our calculation of cost of sales 
sales and marketing expense year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands sales marketing expense of net revenues sales and marketing expenses for decreased as a result of a million decrease in personnel expense  and a corresponding  decrease in travel and related departmental expenses  as a result of employee reductions to align our costs with our anticipated business activity 
we recorded approximately  interest and penalties incurred on payroll taxes during for a preacquisition contingency related to our acquisition of paragon in this amount was related to certain foreign sales and marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses for increased relative to as a result of a million increase in personnel expense  and a  increase in travel and related expenses  the integration of paragon operations  and efforts to focus on the enterprise market 
in addition  we recorded approximately  of interest and penalties related to a preacquisition contingency associated with our acquisition of paragon in this amount was related to payroll and value added taxes on certain foreign sales and marketing activities 
in addition  approximately  was reclassified from income tax expense to operating expense 
research and development expense year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands research and development expense of net revenues the decreases in research and development expenses in compared to were primarily related to decreased pilot expenses and related consulting expenses for projects completed at the end of related to our wireless and voice over ip product introductions 
we also had a decrease in rent expense due to the purchase of our principal r d facility in boulder  colorado near the end of and a decrease in depreciation expense for the year of  in addition  at the end of the second quarter of  we entered into development agreements with two of our customers for which we were paid  in exchange for achieving certain milestones 
this amount was offset against expenses incurred during the periods 
we believe that our research and development expenses will increase in as we accelerate our development of new product platforms and service cards for our existing development for wireless and voice over ip solutions 
research and development expenses for increased from mostly due to an increase in personnel expense of million and approximately million of prototype expenses to support the development and release of our converged ip voice data network  and compression solutions 
related to these programs  we increased our spending by  for software consultants   for pilots  and  for compliance program testing 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands general and administrative expense of net revenues general and administrative expense for increased over primarily due increases in accounting fees of approximately  related to the restatement of the fiscal and fiscal financial statements that occurred in  and an increase in legal costs of approximately million related to the same 
increased legal fees were offset by a decrease in settlement expenses of million  primarily due to the settlement in of the smtc lawsuit 
additional cost savings in included approximately  in rent expense obtained from purchasing our headquarters facility in boulder colorado in the fourth quarter of bad debt expense in was  compared to a recovery of  in 
table of contents general and administrative expense for increased relative to primarily due to a  increase in personnel expense and approximately  related to sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts 
these expenses were offset in part by approximately  of net expense savings obtained through the purchase of our headquarters facility in boulder  colorado  which occurred at the beginning of the fourth quarter of legal expenses increased in as a result of settlement of the smtc lawsuit of approximately million 
bad debt expense recoveries in were  vs 
million in in and  we were able to recover substantially all of the delinquent receivables and part of the accounts receivable related to bankruptcy of our customers 
intangible asset amortization increased by million over due to our acquisition of paragon networks international in november  in addition  in  the company made changes to its restructuring accrual due to changes in estimates with respect to subleases  resulting in a charge of  
other income and expense  net year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands other income and expense  net of net revenues income tax expense benefit of net revenues interest and other income  net for increased to million from million for the increase was primarily attributable to a favorable trend in short term interest rates over interest and other income  net for increased relative to due to million of interest earned on increased cash and cash equivalent balances from our public stock offering that we completed in february we also were released from an accrued liability as part of a bankruptcy settlement agreement that resulted in a net gain of million 
in addition  we recognized a gain of  related to the sale of certain assets 
since the second quarter of  based on our history of taxable net losses and analyses of projected of net taxable income for future operating periods  we have determined that the realization of our net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets is not reasonably assured 
accordingly  we have recorded valuation allowances for all years presented to fully reserve our reported net deferred tax assets 
our net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset up to approximately million of future taxable income for federal tax purposes 
the december  valuation allowance includes reserves for components relating to the paragon acquisition  stock option compensation and net operating loss carryforwards 
as these net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  we will reduce the related valuation allowance 
reductions in the valuation allowance  if any  will be recognized against goodwill for the portion related to the acquisition  against additional paid in capital for the portion relating to stock options and in our statements of operations as an income tax benefit  and may offset any current income tax expense 
in addition  should we demonstrate a history of sustained profitability  we may reverse all or a significant portion of the remaining valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources in  we continued to maintain a strong liquidity position 
as of december   our primary source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments in marketable securities 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of marketable securities of million compared to million as of december  in february of  we completed a stock offering  which generated additional cash of approximately million 

table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows by activity and cash on hand as of december net cash from used in operating activities of continuing operations net cash from used in investing activities of continuing operations net cash from used in financing activities of continuing operations net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  contrasted to  used by operations in cash provided by operations for the year ended december   was primarily due to our net loss of million adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense of million  decreases in inventory of million and decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses of approximately million  offset by decreases in accounts payable of million 
for the year ended december   our cash used by operations resulted from a net loss of million adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense of million  bad debt recoveries of  increases in inventory of million and accounts payable increases of million  offset by decreases in accounts receivable of million 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to a use of cash of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we had net sales of million of marketable securities compared to net purchases of million for the year ended december  our capital expenditures for the year ended december  for equipment to support research  development and manufacturing activities were million compared to million for the year ended december  during  we purchased our facility located at pearl parkway for approximately million 
we believe our current facilities are sufficient to meet our current operating requirements 
capital expenditures in are not expected to exceed those of net cash from financing activities used million for the year ended december   primarily due to the purchase of million of our common stock in the open market under our share repurchase program for million 
we did not purchase any of our shares in this use of cash in was offset by cash receipts of  from the exercise of options for the year ended december  net cash from financing activities provided million for the year ended december   which was the result of cash received from our stock offering of million and million received from the exercise of options 
our net inventory levels decreased approximately million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of changes in our procurement practices 
as of december   our cash requirements for the next months are primarily expected to fund operations  including our investments in research and development  sales and marketing  and matters related to regulatory and other legal proceedings 
contractual cash obligations contractual cash obligations a total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations a amounts represent our known  undiscounted  minimum contractual payment obligations under our long term obligations and include amounts identified as contractual obligations in current liabilities of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we lease office space under various noncancellable operating leases that expire through we record rent expense under noncancellable operating leases using the straight line method after consideration of increases in rental payments over the lease term  and records the difference between actual payments and rent expense as deferred rent concessions 
the company has placed non cancelable purchase orders for million of inventory from certain of its vendors for delivery in purchase orders are generally placed up to months in advance based on the lead time of the inventory 
rent expense for the years ended december    and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases discussed above 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on an ongoing basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our processes used to develop estimates  including those related to revenue and product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and other items that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes that prove different from those upon which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
see note to consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting policies 
we believe the following critical accounting policies have the most significant impact on the estimates and judgments used when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and product returns 
our products are generally sold as part of a contract or distribution agreement 
the terms of the contract or distribution agreement  together with binding purchase orders or other binding documentation taken as a whole  determine the appropriate revenue recognition method 
we recognize revenue  including freight charges  in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which amended and was preceded by staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab statement of financial accounting standard no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  applicable portions of sab topic  revenue recognition and eitf issue no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under these guidelines  we recognize revenue from transactions where persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been provided  the price is fixed and determinable  payment is not contingent on performance of installation or service obligations  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for our products  delivery is considered to occur upon shipment or delivery as defined in our shipping terms  provided that risk of loss  and if necessary title  has transferred to the customer 
for arrangements that include customer acceptance terms  revenue is recognized upon the customer s acceptance of the product or service  which occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
our products include both hardware and embedded software 
to date  the software embedded in our products has not been considered more than incidental to the product and does not represent a separate unit of accounting as defined in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position software revenue recognition sop 
we continue to closely review our contracts and distribution agreements to ensure application of the appropriate revenue recognition method 
for contracts or agreements involving delivery of more than one element of product or service  we apply the fasb emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
each deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it is a separate unit of accounting 
a separate unit of accounting exists where the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any undelivered items  and in cases where the contract or agreement provides a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and is substantially under our control 
provided fair value exists for all units of accounting  revenue is allocated to each element based on relative fair values 
if fair value exists only for the undelivered elements but not the delivered elements  revenue is allocated to the delivered elements by subtracting the fair value of the undelivered elements from the total amount due from the customer 
revenue for each element  or unit of accounting  is recognized under the applicable revenue recognition guidance 
we determine fair value for individual elements on either the stand alone selling prices for these elements when sold separately  or on prices of similar  substantially interchangeable elements sold to similar customers 
accordingly  we believe that selling prices are appropriate indicators of fair value 

table of contents the company makes certain sales through multiple distribution channels  primarily resellers or distributors 
we assess reasonable assurance of collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that reasonable assurance of collectibility is not met  or if payment is contingent upon resale of the company s products  and reliable reporting from our resellers or distributors exists  revenue is recognized when the reseller or distributor sells the product to their customer sell through 
if reliable reporting from the reseller or distributor is not available  we defer revenue recognition until cash is received 
certain customers have the contractual right to return a limited amount of products during a limited post sale period after shipment as part of a stock rotation 
generally  under our stock rotation program  three times per year  eligible customers may return on average up to of unsold inventories purchased within the prior four month period  in exchange for an equivalent dollar value of new products 
we also provide price protection to certain customers 
under our price protection program  generally if we reduce our prices  eligible customers are entitled to receive a credit for the difference between the price paid and the new  lower price for on hand inventory purchased within the days prior to the effective date of the price decrease 
we apply the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and the guidance in applicable portions of sab topic revenue recognition and reduce our revenue by the amount of estimated returns due to stock rotation based upon historical experience 
in the event we reduce prices and the price reduction results in amounts due to eligible customers  we record the amounts due by reducing revenues with a record a corresponding liability 
revenue from installation and training services is deferred and recognized over the period the services are performed 
revenue from maintenance services is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the maintenance agreements 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentives including price protection agreements  stock rotation agreements and other promotional programs 
we estimate these reductions based upon historical experience for the same or similar products sold to the same or similar customers 
if future returns exceed estimates  revenue would be further reduced 
in the event market conditions were to decline or competition to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner programs or incentive offerings  which could result in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time we offer these programs 
excess and obsolete inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record write downs for estimated excess  obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when determining if collection of payment is reasonably assured  we consider results of our ongoing evaluations of our customers credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic and industry trends and changes in customer payment terms  and we adjust the customer account status based upon these factors 
if we have no previous experience with the customer  we obtain reports from various credit reporting organizations  and may request financial statements and other documents eg bank statements from the customer to ensure the customer can make required payments 
if these factors do not indicate collection is reasonably assured  we may not sell to the customer or we defer revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and reserve for estimated credit losses based upon the age of outstanding invoices and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have usually been within our expectations and the provisions established  we did recover a significant portion of aged receivables that we had previously reserved amounting to approximately million and million in and  respectively 
delinquent account balances are written off after we have determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
because our sales are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material impact on our ability to collect our accounts receivable and  accordingly  on our future operating results 
investments in marketable securities our short term investments in marketable securities are comprised of us treasury  government or agency obligations  state and municipal obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt securities 
investments are classified as short term or long term based on their original or remaining maturities and whether the securities represent the investment of funds available for current operations 
all of our investments are held in our name at two major us financial institutions 
at december  and  all of our investments were classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
table of contents based on quoted market prices at the end of each reporting period 
unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a separate component of cumulative other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
if these investments are sold at a loss or are considered to have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary  a charge to operations is recorded 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities disposed of  with realized gains and losses reflected in interest income  net 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination purchase business combinations require us to identify and estimate the fair value of the assets acquired  including intangible assets other than goodwill  and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
these estimates of fair value are based on our business plans for the entity acquired  including planned redundancies  restructuring  use of assets acquired and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of obligations for which no future benefit will be received eg unoccupied lease space that we intend to sublease 
for all material acquisitions the allocation period as defined in financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  has expired 
if actual costs differ from our estimates these changes will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as incurred 
as more fully described in note  income taxes  we established a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets associated with our acquisition of paragon 
to the extent we determine this valuation allowance is no longer necessary  the adjustment amount will be recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets we assess goodwill and other identifiable intangibles annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
some factors that we consider important which may indicate impairment and trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to future operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill or other identified intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risks inherent in our current business model 
in the third quarter of  and we completed our annual impairment tests 
our assessments of goodwill impairment were conducted by estimating and comparing the fair value of our reporting unit  as defined in fas  to the reporting unit carrying value as of that date 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment was conducted by comparing the estimated fair value of the purchased intangible with its carrying amount as of that date 
based on the results of these impairment tests  we determined that our goodwill assets and purchased intangible assets were not impaired during  or we plan to conduct annual impairment tests in the third quarter of each year  unless impairment indicators exist at an earlier date each year 
deferred income taxes we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and or liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
to the extent that we believe a valuation allowance is required  we must include and expense the tax effect of the allowance within the tax provision in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of december  and  we have million and million in net deferred tax assets  respectively 
in order to fully utilize all or any portion of these deferred tax assets  we need to generate sufficient amounts of future us taxable income 
based upon our recent history of losses and an analysis of projected net taxable income for future operating periods  we determined that realization of our tax net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets is not sufficiently assured  and have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets  reducing the carrying amount of net deferred tax assets to zero as of december  and warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on our actual historical product failure rates and repair costs 
on an on going basis  management reviews these estimates against actual expenses and makes adjustments when necessary 
we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending on the specific product and the terms of our customer purchase agreements 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
should actual product failure rates  the costs of repair or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated product warranty will be required and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

table of contents loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of a loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
employee stock options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas accounting for stock based compensation and eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  we account for stock options issued to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 apb accounting for stock issued to employees  and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock based compensation  and interpretation of apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
stock based compensation related to non employees is based on the fair value of the related stock or options in accordance with sfas and its interpretations 
expense associated with stock based compensation is amortized over the vesting period of each individual award 
sfas no 
permits companies to continue to account for stock options issued to employees under apb we currently account for our stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of apb and provide the pro forma disclosures required by sfas presenting results and earnings per share as if we had used the fair value recognition provisions of sfas in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the option s fair value 
the option valuation model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are future stock price volatility and expected option life the amount of time until the options are exercised or expire 
volatility is calculated based upon stock price movements over the most recent period equal to the expected option life 
the expected option life is based on actual exercise activity from previous option grants 
under apb  changes in the option value subsequent to the date of grant are not recognized
