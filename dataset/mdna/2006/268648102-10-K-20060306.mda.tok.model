information storage systems revenues were   and  in  and  respectively  representing increases of in and in the increases in and were due to greater demand for these products attributable to wider acceptance of information lifecycle management based solutions  a broadened product portfolio  increased demand for it infrastructure and new and enhanced distribution channels 
platform based software revenues were   and in  and  respectively  representing increases of in and in platform based software revenues consist of revenues from software whose operation generally controls and enables functions that take place within an emc storage system 
the increases in and in platform based software revenues were attributable to an expanded product offering  a greater demand for software to manage increasingly complex high end and midrange networked storage environments and new and enhanced distribution channels 
the reduced growth rate for platform based software revenues in compared to was attributable to the change in mix of information storage systems sold in to a higher proportion of systems that utilize a lower software content 
the emc multi platform software segment revenues include software license  software maintenance and other services revenues 
software licenses revenues were  and in  and  respectively  representing increases of in and in software maintenance and other services revenues were  and in  and  respectively  representing increases of in and in software license revenue increased due to greater demand for resource management software  backup and archive software and content management software 
the results for each period were favorably impacted by the legato and documentum acquisitions which were completed in october and december  respectively  and the smarts acquisition which was completed in february the growth in software maintenance and other services revenues was primarily due to increased software maintenance revenues  which was favorably impacted by the aforementioned acquisitions 
the emc services segment revenues include software and hardware maintenance and professional services revenues 
emc services revenues increased in and due to greater demand for both software and hardware maintenance contracts associated with increased sales of information storage products 
additionally  increased demand for professional services  largely to support and implement information lifecycle management based solutions  contributed to the increases in and the vmware segment was established as a result of the acquisition of vmware in january and is comprised of virtual infrastructure solutions and services

revenues by geography were as follows percentage change vs vs north america  excluding mexico europe  middle east and africa asia pacific latin america and mexico revenue increased in and in all of our markets due to greater demand for our products and services 
also contributing to the increases were revenues generated from the acquisitions of documentum and legato in  vmware in  and smarts in  new and enhanced distribution channels and broadened product offerings 
changes in exchange rates positively impacted revenue growth by in and by in both and the impact of the change in rates was most significant in the european market  primarily germany  france and italy 
we expect our revenues for to be between billion and billion  representing a growth rate of between and 
however  our revenues could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors  including the economy  demand for it infrastructure  product availability  competitive factors  changes in exchange rates and other factors set forth in item a risk factors

additionally  amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets was spread over a larger revenue base  resulting in margin improvement 
partially offsetting this improvement in the gross margin percentage was a shift in the mix of software license revenues and services revenues  with a greater proportion of revenues being derived from services 
services revenues accounted for of total vmware revenues in compared to in services revenues provide a lower margin than license revenues 
the gross margin percentages for other businesses were  and in  and  respectively

table of contents category beginning balance adjustments to the provision during utilization during ending balance workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities contractual and other obligations total the addition to the provision for workforce reduction in was primarily attributable to finalizing severance packages for employees in foreign jurisdictions 
the addition to the provision for the consolidation of excess facilities in represents the charges for facilities being vacated  offset by the reversal of reserves related to the reactivation of facilities that had previously been vacated 
in addition to these restructuring programs  we have remaining liabilities aggregating associated with restructuring programs prior to the remaining balance relates primarily to consolidation of facilities 
all restructuring programs  with the exception of the restructuring programs  are substantially complete  although our ability to sublet facilities is subject to appropriate market conditions 
the total remaining liability for all of our restructuring programs was as of december  the remaining balance relates primarily to consolidation of facilities and employee termination benefits 
these amounts are expected to be paid out through as of december   we had a goodwill balance of  at least annually we evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
as of december   none of the reporting units had any indication that goodwill was likely to be impaired 
as we continue to refine our business model  we will reassess our cost structure and asset deployment to assess whether additional changes are necessary 
should we determine that additional changes will benefit our business  we may incur additional restructuring and other special charges 
if customer demand for products change or we acquire complementary products  we may be required to write down the value of assets 
additionally  changes in our business model or market conditions could cause goodwill or other assets to be impaired

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles  including staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  fas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  fas no 
 accounting for leases  and sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  among others 
the application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems  software and services or a combination of these items 
as our business evolves  the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized 
additionally  revenue recognition involves judgments  including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience and market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
should market or economic conditions deteriorate  our actual return experience could exceed our estimate 
warranty costs we accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts and notes receivable  investments  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate 
the determination of whether unrealized losses on investments are other than temporary is based upon the type of investments held  market conditions  length of the impairment  magnitude of the impairment and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our ability to recover the cost of our investments may be impaired 
the recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual recovery could be less than our estimate 
other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
our goodwill valuation is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis performed at the reporting unit level 
the analysis factors in estimated revenue and expense growth rates 
the estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  factoring in customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
restructuring charges we recognized restructuring charges in   and prior years 
the restructuring charges include  among other items  estimated losses on the sale of real estate  employee termination benefit costs  subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts 
the amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors  including market conditions and negotiations with third parties 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 

table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not  do not establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
accounting for stock options historically  we recognized stock option costs pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in the notes to our financial statements 
effective in  we will adopt the provisions of fas no 
r  share based payment 
both fas no 
and r require management to make assumptions to determine the underlying value of stock options  including the expected life of the stock options and the volatility of the stock options 
changes to the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the underlying value of the stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
additionally  we will be required to incorporate a forfeiture estimate as we recognize equity expense 
should our actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  this could have a material impact on our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fas no 
r  share based payment 
effective on january   we will adopt the provisions of fas no 
r that require us to recognize the fair value of options granted in our basic financial statements 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the adoption of the statement will result in the expensing of the fair value of stock options granted to employees in the basic financial statements 
previously  we elected to only disclose the impact of expensing the fair value of stock options in the notes to the financial statements 
see accounting for stock based compensation in note a to the financial statements 
the statement applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified  repurchased  or canceled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under statement no 
changes to the grant date fair value of equity awards granted before the effective date of this statement are precluded 
the compensation cost for those earlier awards shall be attributed to periods beginning on or after the effective date of this statement using the attribution method that was used under statement no 
 which was the straight line method  except that the method of recognizing forfeitures only as they occur shall not be continued 
any unearned or deferred compensation contra equity accounts related to those earlier awards shall be eliminated against the appropriate equity accounts 
additionally  common stock purchased pursuant to stock options granted under our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value of the stock option 
the statement also changes the reporting of tax related amounts within the statement of cash flows 
the gross amount of windfall tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation will be reported as financing inflows 
under the indirect method of presentation of the statement of cash flows  any shortfalls resulting from the write off of deferred tax assets will be reported in net income and classified within the change in deferred income taxes in the operating section of the statement of cash flows 
we plan to adopt the statement on a prospective basis beginning january  accordingly  the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations 
the adoption of fas no 
r will have a material impact on our results of operations  increasing cost of sales  sg a expenses and r d expenses 
we currently estimate that adoption of the statement will reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately in  however  the amount may change based upon the number and value of additional stock option grants and forfeiture rates 
we have utilized the black scholes option pricing model to determine the value of our stock options 
we estimated volatility to be  and in  and  respectively 
the decline in volatility in and was due to our recent volatility experience 
we estimated the expected life of stock options that were issued to be  and years in  and  respectively 
the decline in the expected life in and was due to a change in current exercise patterns 
for more information on the impact of expensing stock options on the three years ended december   and  see accounting for stock based compensation in note a to the financial statements 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and credit risk 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk management as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
any foreign currency transaction  defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  will be reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period 
the primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet 
therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the euro  the brazil real  the japanese yen and the british pound 
additionally  we have exposure to emerging market economies  particularly in latin america and south east asia 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
in all cases  we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
the success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes 
we employ a monte carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are calculated by bearmeasurisk as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was million as of december  and million as of december  the average  high and low value at risk amounts for and were as follows in millions average high low the average value represents an average of the quarter end values 
the high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities 
the investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in us dollars 
these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income 
these instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes 
a portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk 
we employ a monte carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for changes in interest rates for our combined investment portfolios 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the bearmeasurisk dataset as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in interest rates  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the investment portfolios was million as of december  and million as of december  the average  high and low value at risk amounts for and were as follows in millions average high low 
table of contents the average value represents an average of the quarter end values 
the high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts 
credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  investments  short and long term investments  accounts and notes receivable and foreign currency exchange contracts 
deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
generally  these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 
we place our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments primarily in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment with any one issuer 
we purchased bank loans with credit ratings below investment grade 
the bank loans have a senior position to other debt and have floating rate coupons  which significantly reduces interest rate risk 
as of december   bank loans represent of our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
we believe this investment strategy more effectively manages our exposure to interest rate risk and diversifies our investment portfolio 
we have entered into various agreements to loan fixed income securities generally on an overnight basis 
under these securities lending agreements  the value of the collateral is equal to of the fair market value of the loaned securities 
the collateral is generally cash  us government backed securities or letters of credit 
at december   there were no outstanding securities lending transactions 
the counterparties to our foreign currency exchange contracts consist of a number of major financial institutions 
in addition to limiting the amount of the contracts we enter into with any one party  we monitor the credit quality of the counterparties 
we employ a monte carlo simulation model to calculate value at risk for changes in credit conditions for our bank loan portfolios 
this model assumes that the relationships among credit spreads  market rates and prices that have been observed daily over the last two years are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the bearmeasurisk dataset as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the bank loan portfolios was million as of december  and million as of december  the average  high and low value at risk amount for and were as follows in millions average high low the credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is low due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas 
we establish an allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable 
the allowance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity 
generally  we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes
