item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide human resource management services  comprised of staffing services and peo services 
we generate staffing services revenues primarily from short term staffing  contract staffing  on site management and direct placement services 
our peo service fees are generated from contractual agreements with our peo clients under which we become a co employer of our client s workforce with responsibility for some or all of the client s human resource functions 
we recognize revenues from our staffing services for all amounts invoiced  including direct payroll  employer payroll related taxes  workers compensation coverage and a service fee equivalent to a mark up percentage 
peo service fee revenues are recognized on a net basis in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf no 

as such  our peo service fee revenues represent the gross margin generated from our peo services after deducting the amounts invoiced to peo customers for direct payroll expenses such as salaries  wages  health insurance and employee out of pocket expenses incurred incidental to employment 
these amounts are also excluded from cost of revenues 
peo service fees also include amounts invoiced to our clients for employer payroll related taxes and workers compensation coverage 
through centralized operations at our headquarters in vancouver  washington  we prepare invoices weekly for our staffing services customers and following the end of each payroll processing cycle for peo clients 
we invoice our customers and clients as each payroll is processed 
payment terms for staffing customers are generally days  while peo clients invoices are generally due on the invoice date 
our business is concentrated in california and oregon and we expect to continue to derive a majority of our revenues from these markets in the future 
revenues generated in our california and oregon offices accounted for of our total revenues in  in and in consequently  any weakness in economic conditions or changes in the regulatory environments in these regions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we offer cash safety incentives to certain peo clients for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the cash incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all workers compensation claims incurred during the customer s contract period 
the safety incentive expense is also netted against peo revenues on our statements of operations 
our cost of revenues is comprised of direct payroll costs for staffing services  employer payroll related taxes and employee benefits and workers compensation 
direct payroll costs represent the gross payroll earned by staffing services employees based on salary or hourly wages 
payroll taxes and employee benefits consist of the employer s portion of social security and medicare taxes  federal unemployment taxes  state unemployment taxes and staffing services employee reimbursements for materials  supplies and other expenses  which are paid by the customer 
workers compensation expense consists primarily of the costs associated with our self insured workers compensation program  such as claims reserves  claims administration fees  legal fees  state administrative agency fees and excess insurance costs for catastrophic injuries 
we also maintain separate workers compensation insurance policies for employees working in states where we are not self insured 
the largest portion of workers compensation expense is the cost of workplace injury claims 
when an injury occurs and is reported to us  our respective independent third party claims administrator tpa analyzes the details of the injury and develops a case reserve  which is the tpa s estimate of the cost of the claim based on similar injuries and their professional judgment 
we then record or accrue an expense and a corresponding liability based upon our estimate of the ultimate claim cost 
as cash payments are made by our tpa against specific case reserves  the accrued liability is reduced by the corresponding payment amount 
the tpa also reviews existing injury claims on an on going basis and adjusts the case reserves as new or additional information for each claim becomes available 
we have established an additional reserve for both future unanticipated increases in costs adverse loss development of the claims reserves for open claims and for claims incurred but not reported related to prior and current periods 
we believe our operational policies and internal claims reporting system help to limit the occurrence of unreported incurred claims 
selling  general and administrative expenses represent both branch office and corporate level operating expenses 
branch operating expenses consist primarily of branch office staff payroll and personnel related costs  advertising  rent  office supplies  depreciation and branch incentive compensation 
corporate level operating expenses consist primarily of executive and office staff payroll and personnel related costs  professional and legal fees  travel  depreciation  occupancy costs  information systems costs and executive and corporate staff incentive compensation 
amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of software costs  and covenants not to compete  which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from two to ten years 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following policies as critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in 
item of this report 
note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
self insured workers compensation reserves 
we are self insured for workers compensation coverage in a majority of our employee work sites 
accruals for workers compensation expense are made based upon our claims experience and an annual independent actuarial analysis  utilizing past experience  as well as claim cost development trends and current workers compensation industry loss information 
as such  a majority of our recorded expense for workers compensation is management s best estimate after reviewing our annual independent actuarial analysis and evaluating subsequent claims development 
we believe the amount accrued is adequate to cover all known and unreported claims at december  however  if the actual costs of such claims and related expenses exceed the amount estimated  additional reserves may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
safety incentives liability 
our accrued safety incentives represent cash incentives paid to certain peo client companies for maintaining safe work practices in order to minimize workplace injuries 
the incentive is based on a percentage of annual payroll and is paid annually to customers who meet predetermined workers compensation claims cost objectives 
safety incentive payments are made only after closure of all workers compensating claims incurred during the customer s contract period 
the liability is estimated and accrued each month based upon the then current amount of the customer s estimated workers compensation claims reserves as established by the company s third party administrator 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to make estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables 
management analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in the customers payment tendencies when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might be impaired 
factors that are considered include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry trends and significant change in the manner of use of the acquired assets 
management s current assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill indicates there was no impairment as of december  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets

which requires us to report such revenues on a net basis because we are not the primary obligor for the services provided by our peo clients to their customers pursuant to our peo contracts 
we present for comparison purposes the gross revenues and cost of revenues information for the years ended december  and set forth in the table below 
although not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management believes this information is more informative as to the level of our business activity and more illustrative of how we manage our operations  including the preparation of our internal operating forecasts  because it presents our peo services on a basis comparable to our staffing services 
in thousands year ended december  revenues staffing services   professional employer services   total revenues   cost of revenues direct payroll costs   payroll taxes and benefits   workers compensation   total cost of revenues   gross margin   a reconciliation of non gaap gross revenues to net revenues is as follows for the years ended december  and in thousands gross revenue reporting method reclassification net revenue reporting method revenues staffing services    professional employer services     total revenues     cost of revenues     years ended december  and net income for amounted to million  an improvement of or million over net income of million for the improvement for was primarily due to higher gross margin dollars as a result of significant growth in professional employer peo services business  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
diluted earnings per share for was compared to 
for the company s improved operating results continue to reflect  in part  growing market acceptance of the business process outsourcing model  market share gains owing to strong branch level management and the competitive advantage of offering a broad array of human resource management services through its peo arrangements 
the trend toward normalization of market conditions for california workers compensation insurance initiated by limited legislature reforms has had little effect on our peo growth rates due to the increasing market acceptance of our broad array of human resource management services 
we expect this favorable trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
revenues for totaled million  an increase of approximately million or  which reflects significant growth in the company s peo service fee revenue  combined with a increase in staffing services revenue 
peo service fee revenue increased approximately million or over primarily due to increased demand for the company s broad array of competitively priced human resource management services 
at december   the company had approximately peo clients as compared to approximately peo clients at december  management believes that the favorable trend in peo revenues will continue for the foreseeable future 
staffing services revenue increased approximately million or over during  the company served approximately  staffing services customers  which compares to approximately the same number of customers during although the number of customers remained at a similar level in as compared to  the increase in staffing services revenues reflects increased business activity with certain customers owing to their size of operation  as well as customers whose demand for the company s services increased 
management expects demand for the company s staffing services will continue to reflect overall economic conditions in its market areas 
gross margin for totaled approximately million  which represented an increase of million or over  primarily due to the increase in revenues 
the gross margin percent increased from of revenues for to for the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to lower direct payroll costs and lower workers compensation expense  offset in part by higher payroll taxes and benefits  all expressed as a percent of revenues 
the decline in direct payroll costs  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for reflects the continuing decline in the mix of staffing services due to an increase in peo services in the company s customer base and the effect of each customer s unique mark up percent 
workers compensation expense  as a percent of revenues  declined from in to in workers compensation expense for totaled million  which compares to million for the moderate increase in workers compensation expense in total dollars was generally due to increased business activity in california 
the increase in payroll taxes and benefits  as a percentage of revenues  from for to for  was largely due to the effect of significant growth in peo services  offset in part by slightly lower effective state unemployment tax rates in various states in which the company operates as compared to we expect gross margin as a percentage of total revenues to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  as well as the adequacy of our estimates for workers compensation liabilities 
in connection with our self insured workers compensation program  we have maintained an excess workers compensation policy that limits the financial effect of costly workers compensation claims 
for  such policies included a self insured retention or deductible of  per occurrence 
effective january   the self insured retention or deductible increased to million per occurrence and remained as such for the january  renewal  with a moderate decline in the premium cost per of payroll 
management believes that we obtained the most favorable terms and conditions available given current market conditions 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and other expenses incident to the operation of our headquarters and our branch offices and the marketing of our services 
sg a for amounted to approximately million  an increase of million or over the increase over was primarily attributable to increases in branch management personnel and related expenses as a result of growth in the company s peo business 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of revenues  declined from in to in other income for was  compared to other income of  for the increase in other income for was primarily attributable to increased investment income earned on the company s higher cash balances  offset in part by a realized loss of  on a prior investment in a bond fund  which was comprised of treasury inflation protected securities  commonly known as tips 
depreciation and amortization totaled million for  which compares to a similar amount for the depreciation and amortization expense level remained relatively comparable to amounts due to our current low level of capital expenditures for operations 
our effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the lower effective rate was primarily attributable to a significant increase in federal tax exempt interest income 
at december   we had net deferred income tax assets of million  which consist of temporary differences between taxable income for financial accounting and tax purposes  which will reduce taxable income in future years 
pursuant to gaap  we are required to assess the realization of the deferred income tax assets as significant changes in circumstances may require adjustments during future periods 
although realization is not assured  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred income tax assets will be realized  principally based upon projected taxable income for the next two years 
the amount of the net deferred income tax assets actually realized could vary  if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred income tax assets or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income as compared to operating forecasts 
if our operating forecast is determined to no longer be reliable due to uncertain market conditions  our long term forecast may require reassessment 
as a result  in the future  a valuation allowance may be required to be established for all or a portion of the net deferred income tax assets 
such a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 
years ended december  and net income for the year ended december  was million  an improvement of million over net income of million for the improvement in net income was primarily attributable to higher gross margin dollars as a result of significant growth in peo services business  offset in part by an increase in sg a expenses to support the increase in business activity 
diluted income per share for was as compared to diluted income per share of for revenues for totaled million  an increase of approximately million or over revenues of million 
the increase in total revenues was due primarily to the significant growth in our peo service fee revenue in california due in part to the competitive advantages available to us as a result of adverse conditions in the workers compensation insurance market in that state  combined with an increase in staffing services revenue 
peo service fee revenue increased million or  while staffing services revenue increased million or  which resulted in an increase in the share of peo service fee revenue to of total revenues for  as compared to for the increase in peo service fee revenue for was primarily due to market acceptance of the business process outsourcing model  market share gains owing to strong branch level management and to increased demand for our services  particularly in california 
at december   we had approximately peo clients as compared to approximately peo clients at december  the increase in staffing services revenue for was primarily due to our acquisition of certain assets of skills resource training center srtc  a staffing services company with nine offices in central washington  eastern oregon and southern idaho  effective january  operations of srtc accounted for approximately million or of the increase in staffing services revenue 
during  we served approximately  staffing services customers as compared to  customers during although the number of customers declined in as compared to  the increase in staffing services revenues reflects increased business activity with certain customers owing to their size of operation  as well as customers whose demand for our services increased 
staffing services revenues decreased to of total revenues for as compared to for gross margin for totaled million  which represented an increase of million or over the gross margin percentage increased from of total revenues for to for the increase in the gross margin percentage was due to lower direct payroll costs  offset in part by higher payroll taxes and benefit costs and higher workers compensation costs  as a percentage of total revenues 
the decrease in direct payroll costs as a percentage of total revenues from for to for primarily reflects the shift in relative mix of services to our customer base from staffing to peo services and to the effect of each customer s unique mark up percent 
the increase in payroll taxes and benefits as a percentage of total revenues from for to for was primarily attributable to higher statutory state unemployment tax rates in various states in which we operate  as well as to the effect of significant growth in peo services 
workers compensation expense for totaled million  which compares to million for the increase in workers compensation expense was generally due to increased business activity  particularly in california  where injury claims are more costly as compared to other states in which we operate  as well as to an increased provision for the future estimated costs of existing claims 
we expect gross margin as a percentage of total revenues to continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the mix between staffing and peo services  including the mix within the staffing segment  as well as the adequacy of our estimates for workers compensation liabilities 
sg a expenses for amounted to million  an increase of million or over million in sg a expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenues declined from for to for the increase in sg a dollars was primarily due to increases in branch management personnel and related expenses as a result of the growth in our peo business and  to a lesser extent  the incremental sg a expenses associated with the srtc acquisition 
depreciation and amortization totaled million for  which compares to million for the depreciation and amortization expense level remained relatively comparable to amounts due to our current low level of capital expenditures 
our effective income tax rate for was  as compared to for the higher effective rate was primarily attributable to a higher federal tax rate as a result of higher taxable income  a higher weighted average state tax rate due to increased taxable income in california and a lower relative effect of tax credits due to higher taxable income 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results we have historically experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and expect such fluctuations to continue in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors such as wage limits on statutory payroll taxes  claims experience for workers compensation  demand for our services and competition 
payroll taxes  as a component of cost of revenues  generally decline throughout a calendar year as the applicable statutory wage bases for federal and state unemployment taxes and social security taxes are exceeded on a per employee basis 
our revenue levels may be higher in the third quarter due to the effect of increased business activity of our customers businesses in the agriculture  food processing and forest products related industries 
in addition  revenues in the fourth quarter may be affected by many customers practice of operating on holiday shortened schedules 
workers compensation expense varies with both the frequency and severity of workplace injury claims reported during a quarter and the estimated future costs of such claims 
in addition  adverse loss development of prior period claims during a subsequent quarter may also contribute to the volatility in the company s estimated workers compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash position of million at december   increased by million over december   which compares to an increase of million for the comparable period in the increase in cash at december   as compared to december   was primarily due to million of net proceeds generated from the company s follow on offering of its common stock completed in early august and to net cash provided by operating activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates and the effects of those fluctuations on the market values of our cash and cash equivalents  our available for sale marketable securities and our long term debt 
the cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of tax exempt money market funds and overnight investments which are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk  except to the extent that changes in interest rates will ultimately affect the amount of interest income earned on these investments 
the available for sale marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk because these securities generally include a fixed interest rate 
as a result  the market values of these securities are affected by changes in prevailing interest rates 
as of december   the company had interest bearing debt obligations of approximately million  of which approximately million bears interest at a variable rate and approximately million at a fixed rate of interest 
the variable rate debt is comprised of a million note payable  of which approximately million remained outstanding as of december  with a year term  which bears interest at the three month libor rate plus basis points 
based on the company s overall interest exposure at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s long term debt or its results of operations 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through diversification and low investment turnover 
our investment policy is designed to maximize after tax interest income while preserving our principal investment 
as a result  our marketable securities consist primarily of short and intermediate term debt securities 
as of december   the company had not entered into any interest rate instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk
