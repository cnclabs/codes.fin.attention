item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and distribution our distribution strategy is based on our belief that the integrity and success of our brands is dependent on strategic growth and careful selection of the retail accounts where our products are merchandised and sold 
we sell our products in approximately  retail locations in the united states and internationally through approximately  retail locations serviced by us and our international distributors 
although we intend to increase our distribution within the action sports and youth lifestyle markets  we believe that the largest growth opportunity for our brands is in the sunglass focused distribution channel  including sunglass specialty and optical retailers 
as a result  we intend to devote substantial resources towards growing sales of our products to these types of retail accounts 
for the fiscal year ended december   of our net sales were to our ten largest customers  which included two international distributors 
for the fiscal year ended december   of our net sales were to our ten largest customers  which included three international distributors 
for the fiscal year ended december   of our net sales were to our ten largest customers  which included four international distributors 
for each of the fiscal years ended december    and  we did not have any single customer or group of related customers that represented or more of our net sales 
domestic sales and distribution we sell our products to retailers who merchandise our products in a manner consistent with the image of our brands and the quality of our products 
we have developed long term relationships with key multi store action sport and youth lifestyle retailers in the united states  such as cycle gear  inc  no fear  inc  pacific sunwear of california  inc  tilly s clothing  shoes accessories and zumiez  inc  and a large collection of action sport retailers that focus on surfing  skateboarding  snowboarding  bmx  snow skiing  motocross  wakeboarding and mountain biking 
we have entered into dealer arrangements with our retailers pursuant to which they issue a purchase order for our products 
these arrangements do not contain minimum purchase commitments and can be terminated by either party at any time 
in order to be recognized as having premium brands  we generally elect to sell through specialty stores instead of mass discount and general sporting goods retail chains 
this has enabled us to maintain brand authenticity by partnering with retailers who share the same focus on influential action sport oriented youth 
our domestic sales force consists of approximately independent  non exclusive field sales representatives  independent  exclusive field sales representatives  seven sub sales representatives  five internal regional sales managers and internal sales and customer service representatives 
we require our retailers and distributors to maintain specific standards in representing our brands at the point of sale  including minimum inventory levels  point of purchase branding  authorized dealer identification and an agreement that ensures store inventory is consistent with our current product collection 
our retailers also must agree not to resell or divert products through unauthorized channels of distribution 
to preserve and enhance our brands  retailers not adhering to strict guidelines are coached to ensure compliance to such guidelines 
retailers that are not able to comply with such guidelines are eliminated from our authorized dealer network 
we understand that our retail partners represent the link between our brands and the consumer  therefore  we have focused on building relationships with buyers  merchandisers and retail sales staff 
our retail marketing 
table of contents and sales support teams ensure that our sales representatives and retailers have the tools  knowledge and support to sell our products 
we provide dealer catalogs  clinic tools  displays  point of purchase materials  dealer mailings  sales representative training and an in house sales support staff to ensure that we focus on all aspects of selling our products and building relationships with our retailers 
we also utilize a unique regional fleet of mobile sales support vehicles operated by key sales representatives 
these vehicles effectively promote our brands at regional action sports events and provide a variety of retailer support services  including inventory replenishment  warranty replacement  billing  merchandising and onsite training 
international sales and distribution our products are currently sold in over countries outside of the united states  which accounted for of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended  of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended december  and of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended december  substantially all of our sales  marketing  and distribution activities outside of the united states  canada  and latin america are serviced directly by our wholly owned european subsidiary  spy optic  srl  located in varese  italy 
substantially all of our international sales are generated by our international distributors 
our international distributors utilize an independent sales force consisting of over non exclusive sales representatives in europe and the asia pacific region 
this local representation allows us to ensure that each region is provided with the marketing  sales support and product mix that is complementary to the needs of retailers within their respective territories 
in addition to our traditional distribution model  we are developing two models of international distribution which do not rely exclusively upon our international distributors and their sales representatives 
the first method consists of collaborating with international distributors or sales agencies to eliminate duplicate supply chain infrastructure  which we refer to as our hybrid distribution program 
we provide marketing oversight  as well as internal operational functions such as shipping products from our us or european distribution centers directly to the retailer  while our regional distributors provide sales  customer service and collections functions 
this distribution model eliminates our fixed cost risks associated with maintaining a direct international sales team 
partnerships with regional distributors or sales agencies also provide us with feedback that we can utilize to conduct regional sales and marketing initiatives specific to a particular sales territory 
as of december   we had three regional distributors or sales agencies that were utilizing our hybrid distribution program 
pan european implementation of this program is projected to be completed by the end of our second method of international distribution consists of targeting sales territories where product demand is expected to support establishing direct operations in such territory  which we refer to as our dealer direct program 
this program utilizes regional independent or employee sales representatives that provide all on site retail services  while we provide all marketing  accounting and fulfillment operations 
fulfillment services can be provided by our us or our european and european based distribution centers  depending on the location of the dealer direct territory 
we have successfully implemented the dealer direct program in canada  italy and france 
we may continue to expand this program in other countries in the future 
promotion and advertising all marketing and branding is managed by our in house staff  which enables us to deliver a targeted  consistent and recognized advertising message 
our commitment to marketing at the grassroots level in the action sports market and the youth lifestyle market within fashion  music and entertainment is the foundation of the promotion and advertising of our brands and products 
we focus our marketing efforts on generation y  which is one of the most influential and growing demographics in contemporary culture 
we seek to increase our brands support and influence within the action sports and youth lifestyle markets through our athlete sponsorship program  a variety of consumer print advertising campaigns and grassroots marketing initiatives  such as sponsorship of action sports events and promotional vehicle tours 

table of contents we employ managers for the surf  skate  snowboard  motocross  downhill mountain bike  bmx  ski and wakeboard sectors of the action sports market  each of whom possesses expertise within his or her specific sport 
many of our managers were professional athletes and remain immersed within their specific sports 
our managers are responsible for selecting sponsored athletes  grassroots marketing and event initiatives  maintaining industry relationships and directing print advertising within their segment 
we are extremely selective with athlete sponsorship and only sign athletes who we believe are able to influence youth culture on a regional or global level 
some of our athletes include surfers dean morrison and clay marzo  snowboarders marc frank montoya and todd richards  skateboarders rob dyrdek and danny way  motocross riders jeremy mcgrath and kevin windham  bmx athlete jamie bestwick  wakeboarder parks bonifay  and nascar driver dale earnhardt  jr 
we sponsor regional and national action sports events and employ a vehicle marketing program to drive the growth of our brands at trade shows and action sports  music and lifestyle events 
our vehicle marketing program primarily consists of a promotional tour bus and six regional sales and marketing vehicles  which we utilize to create a dynamic and unique event experience 
we also have given away a spy branded wakeboarding boat in each of the previous three years in conjunction with air nautique and alliance wakeboarding magazine 
our advertising campaign fuses athletes  lifestyle  innovative product photography and our unique style 
we utilize the exposure generated by our athletes as an editorial endorsement of product performance and style 
major trade magazines  including transworld snowboarding business and snow industries of america daily news  publish special product reports  including reports featuring our products  in conjunction with international and domestic action sport  optical or fashion trade shows 
we take advantage of this by strategically timing product releases to coincide with these trade shows and eyewear dealers purchasing schedules 
we also attend most of the major action sport and optical trade shows in north america  europe and the asia pacific region to promote our brands and products 
product design and development our products are designed for individuals who embrace the action sports and youth lifestyle markets 
we believe our most valuable input comes from our managers  employees  sponsored athletes and sales representatives who are actively involved in action sports 
this connection with the action sports and youth lifestyle markets continue to be the driving force for the design and performance features of our products and is key to our reputation for innovative and authentic product designs 
in order to respond effectively to changing consumer preferences  we attempt to stay abreast of emerging lifestyle and fashion trends in the action sports and youth lifestyle markets 
our design teams constantly monitor regional and global fashion in order to identify trends that may be incorporated into future product designs 
every eyewear design starts with a hand drawn sketch  which is then converted into a computer rendered technical drawing 
the computer rendered technical drawing is then fabricated into a hand finished prototype 
this prototype is extensively analyzed and measured through laboratory and field testing to ensure that it reflects the design integrity of the original sketch and that the fit meets our exacting standards 
in addition  we often incorporate key changes and improvements for our eyewear through input from our managers  employees  sponsored athletes and sales representatives 
once the prototype is thoroughly tested and optimized  the design is translated into a hand polished  steel injection mold 
we differentiate our products from those of our competitors by incorporating innovative designs  advanced optical technology  and premium components and materials 
in certain instances  we believe that such innovations have allowed us to grow consumer acceptance of our products with only nominal increases in manufacturing costs 
we believe that the substantial experience of our design team will greatly enhance our ability to maintain our position as having leading brands in the action sports and youth lifestyle markets and to expand the scope of our product lines 

table of contents we have entered into an agreement with our primary product designer  jerome mage  through his business mage design llc  for the design and development of our eyewear  apparel and accessory product lines 
mr 
mage has agreed to provide his services to us as an independent consultant through december   and to be bound by confidentiality obligations 
mr

product technologies scoop airflow technology our patented airflow system is referred to as scoop airflow technology 
the scoop ventilation system forces air through strategically placed vents on goggle and sunglass frames  which reduces pressure and eliminates fogging 
our scoop technology is protected by five us patents 
currently  we license our scoop technology to one sunglass company on a non exclusive basis 
we do not receive any material amount of revenue from this license at present 
sunglass lens technology our accurate radius curvature  or arc  prismatic lenses are utilized in most of our sunglass frames to provide optically correct  distortion free vision and a total absence of prismatic aberration and astigmatism 
our arc lens becomes thinner as it moves away from the optical center of the lens  thereby complementing the natural curvature of the human eye to provide clarity at all angles of vision  eliminate distortion and selectively filter out light waves that cause eye fatigue and discomfort 
the lens properties  combined with high quality  vacuum applied surface coatings  manipulate the light spectrum to ensure maximum visual performance with no distortion 
we also offer a number of surface coatings to achieve different lens colors by absorbing and reflecting different wavelengths in the light spectrum 
in addition  we integrate filtering agents into our lens manufacturing process to provide eye protection in every type of environment 
all of our lenses provide complete uv protection  including uva  uvb  and uvc energy wavelengths  and provide powerful protection against the harmful effects of all types of solar radiation 
some of our products incorporate high quality injected polarized lenses 
our trident polarized lenses diffuse glare through the use of a highly advanced polarizing filter placed between two injected lens layers  allowing incredible clarity even in the harshest conditions and effectively eliminating almost all blinding glare 
in addition  we market delta photochromic and delta photochromic trident polarized lenses on several sunglass models 
delta photochromic lenses are engineered to automatically adjust to nearly any light condition 
delta photochromic trident polarized lenses combined this self adjusting lens tint with our trident polarized filters for improved depth perception and glare protection 
the result is an unbreakable  auto tinting lens that stops over of blinding glare 
our mosaic lens technology combines retro aesthetics with advanced engineered optics 
mosaic features a dynamic lens curvature that closely conforms to the contours of the face with a multi base curvature that varies from base to base 
the entire lens surface has been engineered for superior optical performance 

table of contents snow goggle technology arc spherical goggle lenses 
our arc spherical goggle lenses employ the same technology as our sunglass lenses 
our goggle lenses consist of an integrated dual lens system that enables the inner lens to conform to body temperature and the outer lens to conform to environmental temperature to eliminate fogging of the lenses 
the outer lens is a high density  scratch resistant injected arc polycarbonate lens 
the thermal spacer between the two lenses consists of an engineered acrylic based bonding agent and closed cell foam gasket 
the inner lens is made of spherically thermoformed  anti fog impregnated propionate 
isotron foam 
the interior lining of our snow goggles where they make contact with an individual s face  which we refer to as isotron foam  is engineered from high quality  ergonomic thermoformed foam to provide each user with a comfortable  custom fit and a superior seal around his or her face 
our isotron foam on several models work in conjunction with our dri force fleece to wick moisture away from an individual s face 
gemini lens technology 
this patent pending lens system features two lenses machine joined with a polyurethane base glue in a moisture free chamber  creating not only a consistent seal but also an airtight environment between the lenses 
this dual lens is then depressurized to a level consistent with the atmospheric pressure common to approximately meters 
this way  when lenses are brought to riding level altitudes  they are already calibrated for that height  mitigating the fogging  warping  and distortion that can often happen with standard foam gasket lenses 
the result is a lens that is nearly impossible to fog and one that does not get deformed by variations in altitude 
motocross goggle technology engineered visual optics 
we use polycarbonate hard coated  scratch resistant extruded lens material on all of our motocross goggles 
all lenses are cut precisely for an exact fit between the lens and the frames 
we also impregnate a high quality anti fog coating into the internal surface of the lenses on our motocross goggles which cannot be wiped off 
the hard coating on the external surface of our lenses prevents scratching 
tear offs 
we utilize engineered thin  antistatic  low haze tear off lens sheets to be used with our motocross goggles to enable riders to retain a clear field of vision 
this ultra thin material enables a rider to stack these lens sheets onto the goggle lens and tear them off while riding in order to maintain a clear field of vision without having to wipe off the goggle lens 
isotron foam 
our motocross goggles  like our snowboard goggles  utilize our isotron foam to create a comfortable  ergonomic fit and superior seal around an individual s face 
our alloy sas model utilizes our dri force fleece  which is bonded to single density isotron foam  and is designed to be used with our two stage sweat absorption system 
all of our motocross goggles also utilize high density filter foam to prevent dust and dirt from entering the rider s field of vision and to enhance air circulation to minimize fogging of the lens 
sweat absorption system 
we have developed a two stage moisture wicking system that absorbs significantly more perspiration than our standard fleece lined isotron foam  which we refer to as sweat absorption system  or sas 
our sas consists of a removable pad which can be replaced at any time to prevent perspiration from entering a user s eyes 
we have obtained a us patent for our sas two stage moisture wicking system 
selectron removeable foam system 
our magneto motocross goggle features patent pending selectron foam  a completely removable and replaceable face foam system 
the idea behind selectron is to allow riders to pick the foam that best meets their fit needs 
in addition  it enables riders to replace old  sweat saturated foam with a fresh part 

table of contents manufacturing historically  we manufactured a substantial majority of our products through two manufacturers  lem srl  or lem  and intersol srl or intersol  both of which are located near our european sales facility in italy 
in january  we completed our acquisition of lem pursuant to an option to purchase lem contained in our prior manufacturing agreement 
we presently rely upon lem for the manufacture of a substantial majority of our sunglass products  and we expect that we will rely on lem for the manufacture of an increasing portion of such products 
our sunglass manufacturing process begins with fabrication of the eyewear frames 
the final mold for each model of our eyewear products is injected with intensely heated materials  such as grilamid or propionate 
the components of each frame are then placed in a wood chip or ceramic chip tumbling machine for up to hours to ensure that every frame piece is completely smooth without any imperfections 
after the tumbling process  the frames are washed in high speed ultra sonic vibration machines to ensure that each piece is completely clean and dust free prior to the extensive inspections  polish  and painting process 
our highly specialized painting process includes up to five layers of paint  substantially all of which are applied by hand 
each of these layers includes an elaborate  multi day painting  drying and curing process 
we also hand set all of our polished metal logos and accents 
our lenses are cut and inserted into frames with exacting standards 
the machinery used to cut each lens ensures that our products will perform to the highest optical standards 
once the assembly process is completed  we test all of our products for optical clarity based on us  european and australian standards 
the american national standards institute and the american society for testing and materials have established specific testing criteria for eyewear 
these tests analyze product safety and provide quantitative measure of optical quality  uv protection  light transmission and impact resistance 
in addition  we perform a broad range of eyewear durability testing and mechanical integrity testing that includes extremes of uv  heat  condensation and humidity 
our testing process also utilizes a laser based lens testing technique to ensure that our lenses meet a variety of optical distortion standards 
after lens testing  each product is inspected for paint quality  fit  finish and overall appearance 
our goggle manufacturing process begins with the fabrication of the goggle frame 
the final mold for each goggle model is injected with intensely heated polyurethane 
the frame components are then carefully washed using specialized cleaning processes that ensure secure paint adherence 
after cleaning  each frame is subjected to our extensive painting process  which can include up to four layers of paint and often includes a specialized method of printing custom paint designs 
several key components of our products are assembled using a sonic welding process to ensure a secure bond between materials  and all of our metal logos and details are hand painted and set into the frame 
all of our goggles utilize what we believe to be the highest quality materials and components from the most reputable suppliers in the industry 
our lenses are carefully assembled using specialized machinery to ensure strict anti fogging lens performance 
once the assembly process is completed  we test our goggles to ensure they meet and exceed all international directives for goggle safety and performance 
these directives analyze product safety by testing for optical clarity  impact resistance  anti fog protection  light transmission  uv protection and quality of frame materials 
in addition to independent laboratory testing  we perform extensive testing at each of our manufacturers  including analyzing our goggles for product strength  wear and accelerated weather testing 
prior to shipment  each goggle is inspected for paint quality  fit  finish and overall appearance 
each of our apparel and accessory manufacturers is carefully selected based upon quality standards  manufacturing methods and ability to produce custom designed products 
all apparel and accessories are manufactured to exacting standards and specifications using high quality materials 
treatments and fits are carefully inspected upon receipt  and products that do not fall within our specification sheets are rejected 
to ensure quality  we require our manufacturers to source specific fabrics  buckles  labels  micro injected logos and other materials

seasonality our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in demand for our products 
historically  we have experienced greater net sales in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the seasonality of our customers and the markets in which we sell our products 
we generally sell more of our sunglass products in the first half of the fiscal year and a majority of our goggle products in the last half of the fiscal year 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our net sales is likely to continue 
as a result  our net sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to do so in the future

risks related to our business if we are unable to continue to develop innovative and stylish products  demand for our products may decrease 
the action sports and youth lifestyle markets are subject to constantly changing consumer preferences based on fashion and performance trends 
our success depends largely on the continued strength of our brands and our ability to continue to introduce innovative and stylish products that are accepted by consumers in our target markets 
we must anticipate the rapidly changing preferences of consumers and provide products that appeal to their preferences in a timely manner while preserving the relevancy and authenticity of our brands 
achieving market acceptance for new products may also require substantial marketing and product development efforts and expenditures to create consumer demand 
decisions regarding product designs must be made several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured 
if we do not continue to develop innovative and stylish products that provide greater performance and design attributes than the products of our competitors and that are accepted by our targeted consumers  we may lose customer loyalty  which could result in a decline in our net sales and market share 
we may not be able to compete effectively  which will cause our net sales and market share to decline 
the action sports and youth lifestyle markets in which we compete are intensely competitive 
we compete with sunglass and goggle brands in various niches of the action sports market including von zipper  arnette  oakley and smith optics 
we also compete with broader youth lifestyle brands that offer eyewear products  such as hurley international and quiksilver  and in the broader fashion sunglass sector of the eyewear market  which is fragmented and highly competitive 
we compete with a number of brands in these sectors of the market  including armani  christian dior  dolce gabbana  gucci  prada and versace 
in both markets  we 
table of contents compete primarily on the basis of fashion trends  design  performance  value  quality  brand recognition  marketing and distribution channels 
the purchasing decisions of consumers are highly subjective and can be influenced by many factors  such as marketing programs  product design and brand image 
several of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including greater brand recognition  a longer operating history  more comprehensive lines of products and greater financial resources for competitive activities  such as sales and marketing  research and development and strategic acquisitions 
our competitors may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions or prevent us from taking advantage of such combinations or alliances 
they also may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or consumer preferences 
if our marketing efforts are not effective  our brands may not achieve the broad recognition necessary to our success 
we believe that broader recognition and favorable perception of our brand by persons ranging in age from to is essential to our future success 
accordingly  we intend to continue an aggressive brand strategy through a variety of marketing techniques  including athlete sponsorship  sponsorship of surfing  snowboarding  skateboarding  wakeboarding  bmx  downhill mountain biking and motocross events  vehicle marketing  internet and print media  action sports industry relationships  sponsorship of concerts and music festivals and celebrity endorsements  to foster an authentic action sports and youth lifestyle company culture 
if we are unsuccessful  these expenses may never be offset  and we may be unable to increase net sales 
successful positioning of our brand will depend largely on the success of our advertising and promotional efforts  preservation of the relevancy and authenticity of our brands in our target demographic  and our ability to continue to provide innovative  stylish and high quality products to our customers 
to increase brand recognition  we must continue to spend significant amounts of time and resources on advertising and promotions 
these expenditures may not result in a sufficient increase in net sales to cover such advertising and promotional expenses 
in addition  even if brand recognition increases  our customer base may decline or fail to increase and our net sales may not continue at present levels and may decline 
if we are unable to leverage our business strategy successfully to develop new products  our business may suffer 
we are evaluating potential entries into or expansion of new product offerings  such as handmade fashion sunglasses and prescription eyewear frames 
in expanding our product offerings  we intend to leverage our sales and marketing platform and customer base to develop these opportunities 
while we have been successful promoting our sunglasses and goggles in our target markets  we cannot predict whether we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for any new products that we may develop 
in addition  expansion of our business strategy into new product offerings will require us to incur significant sales and marketing expenses 
these requirements could strain our management and financial and operational resources 
additional challenges that may affect our ability to expand our product offerings include our ability to increase awareness and popularity of our existing spy brand  establish awareness of any new brands we may introduce or acquire  increase customer demand for our existing products and establish customer demand for any new product offering  
table of contents attract  acquire and retain customers at a reasonable cost  achieve and maintain a critical mass of customers and orders across all of our product offerings  maintain or improve our gross margins  and compete effectively in highly competitive markets 
we may not be able to address successfully any or all of these challenges in a manner that will enable us to expand our business in a cost effective or timely manner 
if new products we may develop are not received favorably by consumers  our reputation and the value of our brands could be damaged 
the lack of market acceptance of new products we may develop or our inability to generate satisfactory net sales from any new products to offset their cost could harm our business 
our business could be impacted negatively if our sales are concentrated in a small number of popular products 
if sales become concentrated in a limited number of our products  we could be exposed to risk if consumer demand for such products were to decline 
in the fiscal years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our net sales were derived from sales of our sunglass products and  and  respectively  of our net sales were derived from sales of our goggle products 
in addition  in the fiscal years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our net sales related to our sunglass products were derived from two models of our product line 
as a result of these concentrations in net sales  our operating results could be harmed if sales of any of these products were to decline substantially and we were not able to increase sales of other products to replace such lost sales 
our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
we place orders with our manufacturers for some of our products prior to the time we receive orders for these products from our customers 
we do this to minimize purchasing costs  the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of non delivery 
we also maintain an inventory of selected products that we anticipate will be in high demand 
we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory 
inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write downs  and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and harm our operating results and financial condition 
conversely  if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the quality products that we require at the time we need them  we may experience inventory shortages 
inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers  negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty  thereby harming our business 
for example  in fiscal and  we experienced delays of two months in the delivery of goggle shipments  which we believe may have reduced our net sales in the third quarters of both fiscal and by less than and  respectively 
if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel necessary to operate our business  our ability to develop and market our products successfully may be harmed 
we are heavily dependent on our current executive officers and management 
the loss of any key employee or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel  including product design and sales and marketing personnel  could delay the development and introduction of  and harm our ability to sell  our products and damage our brands 
we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of barry buchholtz  our chief executive officer 
we have entered into an employment agreement with mr 
buchholtz  however  we cannot be certain that he will not be recruited by our competitors or otherwise terminate his relationship with us 
the loss of the services of mr 
buchholtz would be very difficult to replace 
our future 
table of contents success may also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified management  design and sales and marketing personnel 
we do not carry key man insurance 
if we are unable to retain the services of our primary product designer  our ability to design and develop new products likely will be harmed 
we are heavily dependent on our primary product designer  jerome mage  for the design and development of our eyewear products 
mr 
mage provides his services to us as an independent consultant through his business  mage design  llc 
we cannot be certain that mr 
mage will not be recruited by our competitors or otherwise terminate his relationship with us 
if mr 
mage terminates his relationship with us  we will need to obtain the services of another qualified product designer to design our eyewear products  and even if we are able to locate a qualified product designer  we may not be able to agree on commercially reasonable terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we were to enter into an agreement with a qualified product designer  we could experience a delay in the design and development of new sunglass and goggle product lines  and we may not experience the same level of consumer acceptance with any such product offerings 
any such delay in the introduction of new product lines or the failure by customers to accept new product lines could reduce our net sales 
if we are unable to maintain and expand our endorsements by professional athletes  our ability to market and sell our products may be harmed 
a key element of our marketing strategy has been to obtain endorsements from prominent action sports athletes to sell our products and preserve the authenticity of our brands 
we generally enter into endorsement contracts with our athletes for terms of one to three years 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with these individuals in the future or that we will be able to attract new athletes or public personalities to endorse our products in order to grow our brands or product categories 
further  we may not select athletes that are sufficiently popular with our target demographics or successful in their respective action sports 
even if we do select successful athletes  we may not be successful in negotiating commercially reasonable terms with those individuals 
if we are unable in the future to secure athletes or arrange athlete endorsements of our products on terms we deem to be reasonable  we may be required to modify our marketing platform and to rely more heavily on other forms of marketing and promotion which may not prove to be as effective as endorsements 
in addition  negative publicity concerning any of our sponsored athletes could harm our brands and adversely impact our business 
any interruption or termination of our relationships with our manufacturers could harm our business 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our manufacturers 
we cannot be certain that we will not experience difficulties with our manufacturers  such as reductions in the availability of production capacity  errors in complying with product specifications  insufficient quality control  failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs and failures to comply with our requirements for the proper utilization of our intellectual property 
if our relationship with any of our manufacturers is interrupted or terminated for any reason  including the failure of any manufacturer to be able to perform its obligations under our agreement or the termination of our agreement by any of our manufacturers  we would need to locate alternative manufacturing sources 
the establishment of new manufacturing relationships involves numerous uncertainties  and we cannot be certain that we would be able to obtain alternative manufacturing sources in a manner that would enable us to meet our customer orders on a timely basis or on satisfactory commercial terms 
if we are required to change any of our major manufacturers  we would likely experience increased costs  substantial disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of our products and a loss of net sales 
historically  we have purchased substantially all of our products from two manufacturers  lem and intersol 
in the fiscal years ended december   and  we purchased approximately  and  respectively  of these products from lem and approximately  and  respectively  of these products from intersol 

table of contents in january  we acquired all of the quota a stake in an italian limited liability company srl  which  pursuant to italian law  does not issue shares of lem 
as a result  we expect in the future that the majority of our sunglass and goggle products will be manufactured by lem and the portion of our products manufactured by intersol will decrease 
our manufacturers must be able to continue to procure raw materials and we must continue to receive timely deliveries from our manufacturers to sell our products profitably 
the capacity of our manufacturers to manufacture our products is dependent upon the availability of raw materials used in the fabrication of eyeglasses 
our manufacturers have experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  shortages of raw materials  which have resulted in delays in deliveries of our products by our manufacturers of up to several months 
for example  in fiscal and  we experienced delays in the delivery of goggle shipments due to manufacturing problems 
we believe the delays may have reduced our net sales in the third quarters of both fiscal and by less than and  respectively 
any shortage of raw materials or inability of a manufacturer to manufacture or ship our products in a timely manner  or at all  could impair our ability to ship orders of our products in a timely manner and could cause us to miss the delivery requirements of our customers 
as a result  we could experience cancellation of orders  refusal to accept deliveries or a reduction in purchase prices  any of which could harm our net sales  results of operations and reputation 
any failure to maintain ongoing sales through our independent sales representatives or maintain our international distributor relationships could harm our business 
we sell our products to retail locations in the united states and internationally through retail locations serviced by us through our direct sales team and a network of independent sales representatives in the us  and through our international distributors 
we rely on these independent sales representatives and distributors to provide customer contacts and market our products directly to our customer base 
our independent sales representatives are not obligated to continue selling our products  and they may terminate their arrangements with us at any time with limited notice 
we do not have long term agreements with our international distributors 
our ability to maintain or increase our net sales will depend in large part on our success in developing and maintaining relationships with our independent sales representatives and our international distributors 
it is possible that we may not be able to maintain or expand these relationships successfully or secure agreements with additional sales representatives or distributors on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
any failure to develop and maintain our relationships with our independent sales representatives or our international distributors  and any failure of our independent sales representatives or international distributors to effectively market our products  could harm our net sales 
we face business  political  operational  financial and economic risks because a significant portion of our operations and sales are to customers outside of the united states 
our european operations are located in italy  and our primary manufacturers are located in italy 
in the fiscal years ended december   and  we derived  and of our net sales in the united states based on attributing sales using customer location as opposed to shipping point and  and of our net sales in the rest of the world  primarily in australia  canada  france  japan and spain 
we are subject to risks inherent in international business  many of which are beyond our control  including difficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export  import and other governmental approvals  permits and licenses and compliance with foreign laws  including employment laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including cultural differences in the conduct of business  labor and other workforce requirements  transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels  
table of contents longer payment cycles for  and greater difficulty collecting  accounts receivable  ability to finance our foreign operations  trade restrictions  higher tariffs or the imposition of additional regulations relating to import or export of our products  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  royalties and withholding taxes that restrict the repatriation of earnings and effects on our effective income tax rate due to profits generated or lost in foreign countries  political and economic instability  including wars  terrorism  political unrest  boycotts  curtailment of trade and other business restrictions  and difficulties in obtaining the protections of the intellectual property laws of other countries 
any of these factors could reduce our net sales  decrease our gross margins or increase our expenses 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could harm our results of operations 
we sell a majority of our products in transactions denominated in us dollars  however  we purchase a substantial portion of our products from our manufacturers in transactions denominated in euros 
as a result  if the us dollar were to weaken against the euro  our cost of sales could increase substantially 
we also are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our italian subsidiary  spy optic  srl  and due to net sales in canada 
between january  and december   the euro to us dollar exchange rate has ranged from to 
between january  and december   the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate has ranged from to 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  we had an unrealized foreign currency gain of approximately   and  representing  and of our net sales  respectively 
as of december   we had purchased a total of million euro foreign currency contracts at an average euro rate of euro to us dollar 
the effect of the translation of foreign currencies on our financial results can be significant 
we therefore engage in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on our financial results 
our hedging activities reduce  but do not eliminate  the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include the volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
for the effect of our hedging activities during the current reporting periods  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the degree to which our financial results are affected will depend in part upon the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of our hedging activities 
we may experience conflicts of interest with our significant stockholder  no fear  inc  which could harm our other stockholders 
no fear  inc beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result of no fear s ownership interest  no fear has the ability to influence who is elected to our board of directors each year and  through those directors  to influence our management  operations and potential significant corporate actions 
in addition  as a purchaser of our products  no fear accounted for approximately   and  of our net sales for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
no fear may have interests that conflict with  or are different from  the interests of our other stockholders 
these conflicts of interest could include potential competitive business activities  corporate opportunities  indemnity arrangements  registration rights  sales or distributions by no fear of our common stock and the exercise by no fear of its ability to influence our management and affairs 
further  this concentration of ownership may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company  which could deprive our other stockholders of 
table of contents an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of our company  could harm the market price of our common stock and could impede the growth of our company 
our certificate of incorporation does not contain any provisions designed to facilitate resolution of actual or potential conflicts of interest or to ensure that potential business opportunities that may become available to both no fear and us will be reserved for or made available to us 
if these conflicts of interest are not resolved in a manner favorable to our stockholders  our stockholders interests may be substantially harmed 
in addition  mark simo  the chairman of our board of directors  serves as the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of no fear and owns approximately of no fear s outstanding common stock 
as a result of his position in no fear  mr 
simo may face conflicts of interest in connection with transactions between us and no fear 
if we fail to secure or protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technologies  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our net sales or increase our costs 
we rely on patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and trade dress laws to protect our proprietary rights with respect to product designs  product research and trademarks 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be effective and may be challenged by third parties 
despite our efforts  third parties may have violated and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately  our competitors could imitate our products using processes or technologies developed by us and thereby potentially harm our competitive position and our financial condition 
we are also susceptible to injury from parallel trade ie  gray markets and counterfeiting of our products  which could harm our reputation for producing high quality products from premium materials 
infringement claims and lawsuits likely would be expensive to resolve and would require substantial management time and resources 
any adverse determination in litigation could subject us to the loss of our rights to a particular patent  trademark  copyright or trade secret  could require us to obtain licenses from third parties  could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using certain aspects of our products or could subject us to substantial liability  any of which would harm our results of operations 
since we sell our products internationally and are dependent on foreign manufacturing in italy and china  we also are dependent on the laws of foreign countries to protect our intellectual property 
these laws may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the united states 
although we will continue to devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our intellectual property on a worldwide basis  we cannot be certain that these efforts will be successful or that the costs associated with protecting our rights abroad will not be extensive 
as of the date of this report  we have been unable to register spy as a trademark for our products in a few selected markets in which we do business 
in addition  although we have filed applications for federal registration  we have no trademark registrations for spy for our accessory products currently being sold 
we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights both inside and outside of the united states and  if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights or resolve any conflicts  our results of operations may be harmed 
we may be subject to claims by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights  which are costly to defend  could require us to pay damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
from time to time  we may receive notices of claims of infringement  misappropriation or misuse of other parties proprietary rights 
some of these claims may lead to litigation 
any intellectual property lawsuit  whether or not determined in our favor or settled  could be costly  could harm our reputation and could divert our management from normal business operations 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of our proprietary rights 
a successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease sales or to develop redesigned products or brands 
in addition  we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology  and it is possible that we 
table of contents may not be able to obtain a license on reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to redesign our products or obtain a license  we may have to discontinue a particular product offering 
if we fail to develop a non infringing technology on a timely basis or to license the infringed technology on acceptable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
on march   oakley  inc  one of our major competitors  filed a lawsuit alleging patent trade dress and trademark infringement  unfair competition  and false designation of origin 
the lawsuit specifically identifies three of our product styles which accounted for approximately and of our total net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
while management believes the lawsuit is without merit  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an unfavorable outcome could negatively affect our operating results 
if we fail to manage any growth that we might experience  our business could be harmed and we may have to incur significant expenditures to address this growth 
we have experienced significant growth  which has placed  and may continue to place  a significant strain on our management and operations 
if we continue to experience growth in our operations  our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls may need to be expanded and we may need to train and manage an increasing number of employees  any of which will distract our management team from our business plan and involve increased expenses 
our future success will depend substantially on the ability of our management team to manage any growth effectively 
these challenges may include maintaining our cost structure at an appropriate level based on the net sales we generate  implementing and improving our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  managing operations in multiple locations and multiple time zones  and ensuring the distribution of our products in a timely manner 
we incur significant expenses as a result of being a public company 
we incur significant legal  accounting  insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the sec and nasdaq  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these new rules and regulations have  and will continue  to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly 
these new rules and regulations have also made  and will continue to make  it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
we may not address successfully problems encountered in connection with our acquisition of lem or any future acquisitions  which could result in operating difficulties and other harmful consequences 
in january  we acquired of the capital stock of lem 
the aggregate purchase price was million euro or approximately  in cash  plus a two year earn out based on lem s future sales 
under the terms of the earn out  we are obligated to make quarterly payments based on unit sales  up to a maximum of  through december  we expect to continue to consider other opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies  products and businesses that could enhance our capabilities  complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base  although we have no specific agreements with respect to potential acquisitions or investments 
we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies 
potential and completed acquisitions  including lem  and strategic investments involve numerous risks  including problems assimilating the purchased technologies  products or business operations  problems maintaining uniform standards  procedures  controls and policies  
table of contents unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core business  harm to our existing business relationships with manufacturers and customers  risks associated with entering new markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses 
if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions and strategic investments  our management team may be distracted from our day to day operations  our business may be disrupted and our operating results may suffer 
in addition  if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders would be diluted 
in addition  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances exist which indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
as a result of changes in circumstances after valuing assets in connection with acquisitions  we may be required to take write downs of intangible assets  including goodwill  which could be significant 
our eyewear products may subject us to product liability claims  which are expensive to defend and may require us to pay damages 
due to the nature of our products and the activities in which our products may be used  we may be subject to product liability claims  including claims for serious personal injury 
although we are not involved presently in any product liability claim  successful assertion against us of one or a series of large claims could harm our business 
we could incur substantial costs to comply with foreign environmental laws  and violations of such laws may increase our costs or require us to change certain business practices 
because we manufacture a wide variety of eyewear products at our italian manufacturing facility  we use and generate numerous chemicals and other hazardous by products in our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are subject to a broad range of foreign environmental laws and regulations 
these environmental laws govern  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges and the acquisition  handling  use  storage and release of wastes and hazardous substances 
such laws and regulations can be complex and change often 
contaminants have been detected at some of our present facilities  principally in connection with historical practices conducted at lem 
we have undertaken to remediate these contaminants 
although we currently do not expect that these remediation efforts will involve substantial expenditure of resources by us  the costs associated with this remediation could be substantial  which would reduce our cash available for operations  consume valuable management time  reduce our profits or impair our financial condition 
risks related to the market for our common stock our stock price may be volatile  and you may not be able to resell our shares at a profit or at all 
the trading price of our common stock fluctuates due to the factors discussed in this section and elsewhere in this report 
for example  in  our stock has traded as high as per share and as low as per share 
the trading market for our common stock also is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our industry 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us were to publish an unfavorable research report or to downgrade our stock  our stock price likely would decline 
if one or more of these analysts were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 

table of contents fluctuations in our operating results on a quarterly and annual basis could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of changes in demand for our products  our effectiveness in managing our suppliers and costs  the timing of the introduction of new products and weather patterns 
historically  we have experienced greater net sales in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the seasonality of our customers and the markets in which we sell our products  and our first and fourth quarters have traditionally been our weakest operating quarters due to seasonality 
we generally sell more of our sunglass products in the first half of the fiscal year and a majority of our goggle products in the last half of the fiscal year 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our net sales is likely to continue 
as a result  our net sales and operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
in future periods  our net sales and results of operations may be below the expectations of analysts and investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our expense levels in the future will be based  in large part  on our expectations regarding net sales and based on acquisitions we may complete 
for example  in january we completed the acquisition of our primary manufacturer lem srl many of our expenses are fixed in the short term or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales 
we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any shortfall of sales 
future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 
sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales might occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
as of march   we have  shares of common stock outstanding and  shares subject to unexercised options to purchase shares of common stock that are fully vested 
in addition  in connection with our initial public offering  we issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock to roth capital partners  llc  and an affiliate 
delaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
these provisions include the following the establishment of a classified board of directors requiring that not all directors be elected at one time  the size of our board of directors can be expanded by resolution of our board of directors  any vacancy on our board can be filled by a resolution of our board of directors  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting  the ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval  the ability of the board of directors to issue and designate the rights of  without stockholder approval  up to  shares of preferred stock  which rights could be senior to those of common stock  and the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to take action by written consent 

table of contents in addition  because we reincorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  or delaware law 
these provisions may prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
the provisions in our charter  bylaws and under delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts and could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future  resulting in the market price being lower than it would without these provisions 
we are party to securities litigation that distracts our management  is expensive to conduct and seeks a damage award against us 
we  our directors and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in two stockholder class action lawsuits filed in the united states district court for the southern district of california 
a consolidated complaint  filed october   purported to seek unspecified damages on behalf of an alleged class of persons who purchased our common stock pursuant to our registration statement we filed in connection with our public offering of stock on december  the complaint alleged that we and our officers and directors violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose in the registration statement material information about plans to make a distribution change in our european operations  our dealings with one of our customers and whether certain of our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of oakley  inc we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint which the court granted on march  the court allowed plaintiffs to file an amended complaint only with respect to their claim about a european distribution change

the case is still in the pretrial stage 
for the stockholder lawsuits  the company has accrued an amount up to the maximum to be paid of  on its insurance deductible under its director and officer coverage 
this litigation presents a distraction to our management and is expensive to conduct

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  sales returns  income taxes  accounts receivable allowances and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
our payment terms generally range from net to net  depending on the country or whether we sell directly to retailers in the country or to a distributor 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our earnings would be adversely affected 
reserve for refunds and returns and allowance for doubtful accounts we reserve for estimated future refunds and returns at the time of shipment based upon historical data 
we adjust reserves as we consider necessary 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for anticipated bad debts and refunds 
provisions are made based upon a review of all significant outstanding invoices and overall quality and age of those invoices not specifically reviewed 
in determining the provision for invoices not specifically reviewed  we analyze collection experience  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the data used to calculate these allowances does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  an adjustment in the reserve for refunds may be required 

table of contents inventories inventories consist primarily of finished products  including sunglasses  goggles  apparel and accessories  product components such as replacement lens  purchasing and quality control costs  and packaging and shipping materials 
inventory items are carried on the books at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out method of inventory 
periodic physical counts of inventory items are conducted to help verify the balance of inventory 
a reserve is maintained for obsolete or slow moving inventory 
research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we capitalize product molds and tooling and depreciate these costs over the useful life of the asset 
income taxes we account for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed at each balance sheet date for temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our management s judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency and derivative instruments the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiary  spy optic  srl  and our canadian division is the local currency 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the company designates its derivatives based upon the criteria established by sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas  sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s fair value gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
any realized gain or loss on such derivative is reported in cost of goods sold in the accounting period in which the derivative matures 
the fair value gain or loss from the ineffective portion of the derivative is reported in cost of goods sold immediately 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value is recognized at the end of each accounting period in cost of goods sold

the commitments represent primarily athlete endorsements and facility leases 
purchase orders are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
obligations under contracts that we may terminate without a significant penalty are also not included in the table above 
credit facilities our line of credit with comerica bank allows for borrowings up to million and matures in july at both december  and  amounts outstanding under our line of credit were zero 
on april   comerica bank issued a letter of credit on behalf of us and lem srl to san paolo imi in the amount of million 
the letter of credit served to allow lem to consolidate the debt outstanding of lem with san paolo imi 
the letter of credit reduces the amounts available to us under our line of credit by approximately million 
we also had a term loan with comerica which was paid in full in june at december  the loan amount outstanding was approximately  we have a foreign exchange facility of million with comerica 
this facility allows us to purchase up to million in currency contracts used primarily to hedge our foreign currency exposure  primarily product purchases from our suppliers in euro 
this foreign exchange facility is due to mature in april as of december   our total outstanding currency contracts under this facility converted to us dollars was million 
this represents approximately million euro foreign currency contracts at december  all of our loan facilities and term loans with comerica described above are secured by all of our assets  excluding our intellectual property 
we also have agreed to the following material covenants we must maintain a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least to  we must maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of not more than to  we must maintain a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of not more than to in order to avoid a borrowing base calculation  we must maintain a ratio of quick assets to current liabilities of at least to  we must maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million  to be increased on a quarterly basis by of the aggregate net income of each fiscal quarter and of capital infusions  including any subordinated debt  
table of contents we must maintain an annual minimum profit of  and cannot have more than two consecutive quarterly losses  we must provide comerica with periodic financial reports  we must maintain minimum insurance coverage  and we cannot pay dividends or make any other distributions or payments without comerica s prior written consent 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants 
at december   we were not in compliance with the minimum annual profit and tangible net worth requirements and obtained a waiver of these covenants from the bank 
in addition to loan facilities  we have historically relied upon loans from private lenders to fund our working capital needs 
at december   there was no private lender debt outstanding 
we believe that our cash on hand and available loan facilities will be sufficient to enable us to meet our financing and operating requirements for at least the next months 
changes in operating plans  lower than anticipated net sales  increased expenses or other events  including those described in item a  risk factors  may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of net sales growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the continuing market acceptance of our product designs 
although currently we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution of our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing  other than our current loan facility  and there is no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
deferred taxes in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the level of historical operating results and projections for the taxable income for the future  management has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance  will be realized 
accordingly  the company has recorded no valuation allowance for its us operations at december  and the company has recorded a  and  valuation allowance for its wholly owned subsidiary  spy optic  srl at december  and  respectively 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and foreign exchange rates 
at december   we had no debt outstanding under our loan facilities with comerica 
we had unused lines of credit with comerica of million 
the amounts outstanding under these loan facilities at any time may fluctuate and we may from time to time be subject to refinancing risk 
we do not believe that a change of basis points in interest rate would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
foreign currency risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases  assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our risk management strategy with respect to this market risk includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
our risks  risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for these exposures are outlined below 
we operate our business and derive a substantial portion of our net sales outside of the united states 
in fiscal  and  we derived  and of our net sales in the rest of the world 
we also purchase a majority of our products in transactions denominated in euros 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates between the local currencies of the foreign markets in which we operate and the us dollar 
our foreign currency exposure is generally related to europe 
a strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar or to other currencies in which we receive revenues could impact negatively the demand for our products  could increase our manufacturing costs and could reduce our results of operations 
in addition  we manufacture a substantial amount of our sunglass and goggle products in italy 
because these purchases are paid in euros  we face currency risk 
a strengthening euro could negatively affect the cost of our products and reduce our gross profit margins 
we use forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted purchase of products at prices denominated in euros 
we also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  consisting of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures 
we recognize the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency denominated exposures 
as of december   we had purchased a total of million euro foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges at an average euro rate of euro to us dollar and sold million euro foreign currency contracts at an average euro rate of not designated as hedging instruments 
the exchange rate for the euro to the us dollar ranged from to in fiscal with an average of 
as part of our risk management procedure  a sensitivity analysis model is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings of market sensitive instruments resulting from a change in foreign currency values 
the sensitivity analysis model quantifies the estimated potential effect of unfavorable movements of in foreign currencies to which we were exposed at december  through its derivative financial instruments 
the estimated one day loss from our foreign currency derivative financial instruments  calculated using the sensitivity model described above  is  at december  we believe that such a hypothetical loss from derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 

table of contents the sensitivity analysis model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in earnings that we may incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the maximum possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we adopted sfas r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  we will recognize compensation expense based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based compensation arrangements granted after the effective date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
to provide public companies additional guidance in apply the provisions of sfas r 
among other things  sab describes the staff s expectations in determining the assumptions that underlie the fair value estimates and discusses the interaction of sfas r with certain existing staff guidance 
sab should be applied upon the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will impact our results of operations  although it will have no material impact on our overall financial position 
the adoption of sfas r will increase our operating expenses 
we anticipate the increase will be approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  for options that remain unvested as of december  the full impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be reasonably estimated at this time because it will depend on levels and types of share based compensation arrangements in the future  along with the valuation model used and related assumptions 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss per share  as discussed above 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  and whether we have a sufficient additional paid in capital windfall pool to cover potential expense 
in march  the fasb issued financial interpretation number fin to clarify the timing of the recording of certain asset retirement obligations required by sfas fin is effective december  the adoption of fin has not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will apply sfas in future periods when it becomes applicable 

table of contents in december  the fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
 application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of  to provide guidance on the application of sfas no 
to the provision within the american jobs creation act of the act that provides tax relief to us domestic manufacturers 
the fsp states that the manufacturer s deduction provided for under the act should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas no 
and not as a tax rate reduction 
a special deduction is accounted for by recording the benefit of the deduction in the year in which it can be taken in our tax return  and not by adjusting deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of the act s enactment which would have been done if the deduction on qualified production activities were treated as a change in enacted tax rates 
the fsp also reminds companies that the special deduction should be considered by an enterprise in a measuring deferred taxes when the enterprise is subject to graduated tax rates and b assessing whether a valuation allowance is necessary as required by sfas no 
the fsp is effective upon issuance 
in accordance with the fsp  we will record the benefit  if any  of the tax deduction in the year in which the deduction becomes available 
in december  the fasb staff issued fsp fas no 
 accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  to provide accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provisions included in the act 
the act introduced a special limited time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer 
as a result  an issue has arisen as to whether an enterprise should be allowed additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the act was enacted to evaluate the effects of the act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 
the fsp is effective upon issuance 
the adoption of this fsp did not have a significant effect on our financial statements
