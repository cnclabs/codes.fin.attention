introduction the trust is a grantor trust formed under the laws of the state of new york 
the trust does not have any officers  directors  or employees  and is administered by the bank of new york the trustee acting as trustee pursuant to a depositary trust agreement between the trustee and the sponsor of the trust the sponsor 
the trust issues shares representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in its net assets 
the assets of the trust consist primarily of gold bullion held by a custodian as an agent of the trust and responsible only to the trustee 
the trust is a passive investment vehicle  and the objective of the trust is merely for the value of each share approximately to reflect  at any given time  the price of the gold bullion owned by the trust less the trust s liabilities anticipated to be principally for accrued operating expenses divided by the number of outstanding shares 
the trust does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from  or ameliorate losses caused by  changes in the price of gold

valuation of gold  computation of net asset value 
on each business day  as soon as practicable after pm new york time  the trustee evaluates the gold held by the trust and determines the net asset value of the trust and the net asset value per share 
the trustee values the gold held by the trust using the comex spot settlement price 
having valued the gold held by the trust  the trustee then subtracts all accrued fees other than fees to be computed by reference to the value of the trust or its assets  expenses and other liabilities of the trust from the value of the gold and other assets of the trust 
the result is the adjusted net asset value of the trust  which is used to compute all fees including the trustee s fee and the sponsor s fee  which are calculated from the value of the trust s assets 
to determine the net asset value of the trust  the trustee subtracts from the adjusted net asset value of the trust the amount of fees computed from the trust assets 
the trustee also computes the net asset value per share  by dividing the net asset value of the trust by the number of shares outstanding on the date the computation is made 

table of contents liquidity the trust is not aware of any trends  demands  conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs 
in exchange for a fee the sponsor s fee the sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the trust 
as a result  the only ordinary expense of the trust during the period covered by this report was the sponsor s fee 
the trust s only source of liquidity is its sales of gold 
critical accounting estimates the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the trust s financial position and results of operations 
these estimates and assumptions affect the trust s application of accounting policies 
below we describe the valuation of gold bullion  a critical accounting policy that we believe is important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
valuation of gold bullion gold bullion held by the trust is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
for purposes of this calculation  market values are based on the comex spot settlement price 
should the market value of the gold bullion held be lower than its average cost  impairment to the carrying value of the gold will be recorded and the comex spot settlement price will be used as the value for financial statement purposes 
as indicated above  the comex spot settlement price is also used to value gold bullion held for purposes of calculating the net asset value of the trust  which in turn is used for the calculation of the redemption value of outstanding trust shares 
there are other indicators of the value of gold bullion that are available that could be different than that chosen by the trust 
the comex spot settlement price is used since it is commonly used by the us gold market as an indicator of the value of gold  and is required by the depositary trust agreement 
the use of an indicator of value of gold bullion other than the comex spot settlement price could result in materially different fair value pricing of the gold in the trust  and as such  could result in different lower of cost or market adjustments or in different redemption value adjustments of the outstanding redeemable capital shares 

table of contents the following chart shows the daily comex gold spot settlement prices for the calendar year ended december  logo the period january  date of inception through december  cumulatively for the fiscal period  the trust s net assets grew from  at january  to  at december   a increase 
the increase in the trust s net assets resulted primarily from an increase in outstanding shares  which rose from  at january  to  at december  as a consequence of  shares baskets  each basket consisting of  shares being created and  shares baskets  each basket consisting of  shares being redeemed during the fiscal period 
a positive change in the comex spot settlement price  which rose from at january  to at december   directly relates to the rise in the trust s net asset value per outstanding share from at january  to at december   which tracked the change in the comex spot settlement price 
the trust s net asset value per share rose slightly less than the comex price of gold on a percentage basis due mainly to sponsor s fees  which were  for the fiscal period  or of the trust s average weighted assets of  during the fiscal period 
the net asset value per share of at december  was the highest during the fiscal period  compared with a low of at february  the net asset value of the trust is obtained by subtracting the trust s daily liability for expenses on any day from the value of the gold owned by the trust on that day  the net asset value per share is obtained by dividing the net asset value of the trust on a given day by the number of shares outstanding on that date 

table of contents net income for the period from january  through december  was  resulting from a net gain of  on the sale of gold to pay expenses and a net gain of  on gold distributed for the redemption of shares  offset by sponsor s fees of  other than the sponsor s fees  the trust had no other ordinary or extraordinary expenses during the fiscal period
