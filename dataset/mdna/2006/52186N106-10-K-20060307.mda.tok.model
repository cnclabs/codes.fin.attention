advertising and marketing our advertising and marketing strategy is designed to establish leapfrog as the leading provider of engaging  effective  quality technology based learning solutions for the infant through high school audience and as a brand that parents and educators will seek to supplement a child s educational needs 
we use a variety of advertising and marketing methods to support our brands and products 
our strategy includes use of network and national cable television advertisements and national print campaigns featuring our leapfrog brand 
in addition  we direct our advertising both at parents as well as children 
for example  we have pursued promotional campaigns with partners such as tropicana where our logo was featured on cartons of tropicana orange juice providing widespread exposure of the leapfrog brand 
globally  we have also employed a public relations strategy to gain additional brand exposure through television appearances by senior management and our international marketing and sales teams where they showcase our products  often during the key holiday selling period

phil s hot holiday gifts  abc world news tonight with peter jennings the incredible shrinking computer  and abc world news now ahead of the curve tech toys for children 
we continue to expand our marketing reach using online advertising media and websites designed to preview game play and product functionality 
in addition  in  we launched our mexico and us hispanic websites 
for a discussion of risk factors related to our advertising and promotional activities  see item a 
risk factors our advertising and promotional activities may not be successful 
globally  we have well established retailer relationships and utilize an aggressive campaign to gain print advertising through cooperative print advertisements in local newspapers 
these advertisements run by our retail partners such as toys r us  wal mart  kmart and target  highlight promotional activities and the availability of particular leapfrog products at these retail outlets 
in key retail stores  we use in store demonstration display units to highlight our leapfrog products and provide an in store user experience 
our schoolhouse division utilizes a variety of advertising and marketing tools to build brand awareness in the education market  including placing advertisements in leading education publications targeting school administrators and teachers  and participating in key education trade shows and events 
sales and distribution a limited number of customers historically have accounted for a substantial portion of our net sales 
in  sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately  and respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
in  sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
for a discussion of this concentration risk see item a 
risk factors our business depends on three retailers that together accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in  and approximately of the us consumer segment sales  and our dependence upon a small group of retailers may increase 
us consumer we market and sell our products primarily through national and regional mass market retail stores as well as specialty toy stores 
sales of our products to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target 
table of contents accounted for approximately  and of net sales in our us consumer segment in and  and in  respectively 
our remaining us consumer retail sales come from sales of our products to other mass marketers  club stores  electronic  office supply and specialty toy stores 
our sales team works with store buyers from our key retailers to forecast demand for our products  develop the store floor footprint  secure retail shelf space for our products and agree upon pricing components  including cooperative advertising allowances 
the large retail chains generally provide us with a preliminary forecast of their expected purchases of our products during the year 
while these and subsequent forecasts are not contractually binding  they provide important feedback that we use in our planning process throughout the year 
we work closely with our key retailers during the year to establish and revise our expected demand forecasts and plan our production and delivery needs accordingly 
most retailers issue purchase orders to us as they need product 
based on these purchase orders  we prepare shipments for delivery through various methods 
we sell to smaller retail stores through a combination of independent sales representatives and direct salespeople 
international consumer as of december  we maintained four overseas subsidiaries through which we sell our products directly to leading retailers in the united kingdom  canada  mexico and france 
we currently have distribution arrangements in korea  australia  new zealand  latin america and europe 
distribution of products to the middle east  southeast asia and eastern europe are coordinated out of our united kingdom office 
in japan  benesse corporation is assisting us in developing the japanese supplemental educational materials market by distributing the cocopad system to its preschool through rd grade level subscribers 
additionally  benesse corporation has developed original educational content in japanese and english for interactive books to be used with the cocopad system 
education and training our education and training segment s primary customers represent us pre kindergarten through th grade classrooms and also include teacher supply stores and catalog sales by our schoolhouse division 
using our in house sales team as well as independent sales representatives  we sell directly to educational institutions at the classroom  school and district levels  and to resellers and retail outlets that target the education market 
we also publish a catalog that is aimed at and distributed to educators 
in  we began selling classroom products in mexico through local distributors and continue to sell products through local distributors in puerto rico 
in  we also established key strategic partnerships that are designed to diversify our revenue sources 
these relationships include an alliance with the national head start association

research and development hardware and software development to develop our products and content  we have assembled a team of technologists with backgrounds in a wide variety of fields including education  child development  hardware engineering  software development  video games and toys 
we have developed internally each of our current platforms and stand alone products  although we use licensed technology if it is advantageous to do so 
for example  we use a version of macromedia s flash player in our leapster and leapster l max platforms  and we use optical scanning technology from anoto ab in our fly pentop computer platform  which we launched in fall 
table of contents we have successfully developed proprietary technologies that we use across a number of products in the markets we serve 
we have made innovations in the areas of touch detection technology  speech compression  music synthesis and content generation 
by combining technology developments in mixed signal application specific integrated circuits  or asics  we have been able to add features at comparatively low cost 
we have built internal expertise in hardware design  hardware synthesis  mixed signal custom asic design  real time embedded systems  software design  tools for packaging and compiling product content and mechanical engineering 
the research and development team participates in all phases of the product development process from concept through manufacturing launch 
content development our dedicated content production department has written scripts and designed a large majority of the art  audio and other content for our interactive books  activity cards and stand alone products  applying our own pedagogical approach that is based on established educational standards 
most of the members of our content production team have prior experience in the education  entertainment and educational software or video game industries 
we have developed a portion of our content using licensed characters such as disney princesses  thomas the tank engine  scooby doo  dora the explorer  spider man  spongebob squarepants and characters from the movies madagascar  finding nemo and the incredibles 
we launched our developer s studio in july  which consists of a team dedicated to creating software tools that help turn the content designed by our content developers into interactive content that works with our various platforms 
in an effort to increase the amount and variety of content available for our platform products  we make these tools available to outside developers 
our developer s studio team trains and provides technical support to internal and external content development teams  and works with our production team to turn our internally developed content into interactive books and software 
finally  this team is responsible for managing the business relationships with our community of third party developers that are trained to create content for our platforms 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in intellectual property we believe that the protection of our patents  trademarks  trade dress  copyrights and trade secrets is critical to our future success  and we aggressively protect our proprietary rights through a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual agreements 
as of december   we had more than utility and design patents issued by the us patent and trademark office  as well as more than issued internationally 
these include domestic and foreign patents related to our leappad platform technology  which do not expire before additionally  we have filed more than patent applications pending in the united states and in other countries 
we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents  or that  if issued  any of these patents  or our patents that have already issued  will offer protection against competitors with similar technology 
as of december   we also had over us trademark registrations  including for marks incorporating leapfrog and the leappad and neartouch marks  as well as over foreign trademark registrations 
we also rely upon trade secrets  technical know how and continuing invention to develop and maintain our competitive position 
for a discussion of how our intellectual property rights may not prevent our competitors from using similar or identical technology  see item a risk factors our intellectual property rights may not prevent our competitors from using our technologies or similar technologies to develop competing products  which could weaken our competitive position and harm our operating results 
for a discussion of how our 
table of contents intellectual property rights may not insulate us from claims of infringement by third parties  see item a risk factors third parties have claimed  and may claim in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  which may cause us to incur significant litigation or licensing expenses  or to stop selling some or all of our products  or using some of our trademarks 
manufacturing  logistics and other operations our manufacturing and operations strategy is designed to maximize the use of outsourced services particularly with respect to the actual production and physical distribution of our products and to concentrate our internal resources on areas such as engineering  production planning and quality control 
we believe our outsourcing strategy also enhances the scalability of our manufacturing efforts 
in order to work closely with our manufacturing service providers  we have established subsidiaries in hong kong and macau 
prior to the fourth quarter of  leapfrog sourced and provided  on consignment  some of the components used in our product 
during the fourth quarter  we began the transition to a turnkey mode of operations which requires our contract manufacturers to source directly the necessary components and build finished products to our specifications 
these turnkey operations provide a more effective supply chain process by allowing leapfrog s engineering resources to focus on the product design and manufacturability while our contract manufacturers manage the supply of raw materials into the process 
this approach also provides clear task ownership and facilitates coordination of up stream suppliers with a single point of contact 
in addition  our contract manufacturers  who provide similar services to other companies  can source the raw materials more cost effectively than we can 
most of our products are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic and paper  and the majority of our products require electronic components 
these raw materials are readily available from a variety of sources  but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price 
some of our electronic components used to make our products  including our asics  currently come from sole suppliers 
for information as to how this concentration of suppliers could affect our business  see item a risk factors we depend on our suppliers for our components and raw materials  and our production or operating margins would be harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available and increases in our component or manufacturing costs could reduce our gross margins 
in  we used various contract manufacturers located in asia  primarily mainland china  to build our finished products 
these suppliers are selected based on their technical and production capabilities and are matched to particular products to achieve cost and quality efficiencies 
in addition  we have nine manufacturing suppliers in north america to address our specialized needs and fast turnaround requirements on a periodic basis for certain products 
we have our own quality assurance employees on site at the majority of our contract manufacturers 
during  and  our top three contract manufacturers combined supplied approximately  and of the total value of our products  respectively 
for information as to how this concentration of manufacturing could affect our business  see item a risk factors we rely on a limited number of manufacturers  virtually all of which are located in china  to produce our finished products  and our reputation and operating results could be harmed if they fail to produce quality products in a timely and cost effective manner and in sufficient quantities 
in our us consumer segment  some products are shipped directly to our contract warehouse in fontana  california and are later shipped to meet the demands of our major us retailers and other smaller retailers and distributors throughout the united states  and some products are shipped directly to the retailers locations 
the products for our international segment are either shipped directly to our international distributors or to local country contract warehouses from which the products are then shipped to meet the demands of our international distributors and customers 
the products for our education and training segment are shipped directly to our contract warehouse in chino  california and are later shipped to meet the demands of the educational institutions and educators who purchase our products 
information technology our information technology environment is built around an oracle system that supports our core order management  distribution  manufacturing and financial operations worldwide 
we are also in the process of 
table of contents implementing new applications that are intended to further improve our supply chain management capabilities 
these applications include supply chain planning software and improvements to warehouse management systems for our distribution facilities 
in addition  we also have software systems that we use for both sales analytics  financial planning and financial reporting 
for information as to how our information technology environment could affect our business  see item a risk factors we have had significant challenges to our management systems and resources  particularly in our supply chain and information systems  and as a result we may experience difficulties managing our business 
consumer service we believe that our ability to establish and maintain long term relationships with consumers and retailers depends  in part  on the strength of our customer support and service operations 
we encourage and utilize frequent communication with and feedback from our customers and retailers to continually improve our products and service 
we have contracted with an outside customer service provider who operates hours a day  days a week during peak periods  specifically from december through january  and hours on weekdays  and hours on saturdays during off peak periods 
we offer toll free telephone support for consumers and retailers who prefer to talk directly with a customer service representative 
we also respond to email inquiries received through our website  and we have a team of in house consumer service representatives who oversee and coordinate our customer service activities with our third party customer service provider 
in addition  on our website  we have a knowledge resource link that directs consumers to a frequently asked questions section  which we update as we receive consumer feedback 
we also have a dedicated retail sales service team 
this team works with our top retailers and provides point of sale related analysis for better forecasting and inventory plans 
our consumer service and retail sales service teams are managed from our emeryville  california corporate offices 
competition we compete in the infant toddler  preschool  and electronic learning aids categories of the us and international toy industry 
this category continues to grow in size and importance  and as a result  it is an increasingly competitive arena 
competitors in the educational toy market continue to increase their investment in product research and development and advertising  while focusing on management of global product launches and retail shelf space 
we believe our products compete in these market segments based on brand  product design features  learning content and experience  quality and price 
we believe the leapfrog brand is recognized for quality educational products  enabling us to compare favorably with many of our current competitors on some or all of these factors 
our current principal competitors in the infant toddler and preschool categories include mattel  inc primarily under its fisher price brand  hasbro  inc 
and vtech holdings ltd  or vtech 
the infant toddler category is strategically significant because it introduces parents to the leapfrog line of educational products 
our leappad family competes in the marketplace with other learning products designed to focus on learn to read skills 
we believe our leappad family of hardware and software offers the most extensive line of products and interactive books in the market 
in this category and age range  we also compete with educational software publishers  such as knowledge adventure  best known for its mathblaster and jumpstart learning system software titles that are found at mass retailers  electronics and toy stores 
recent market trends show an ever increasing shift to screen based learning with companies using handheld devices as well as television monitors to deliver an interactive  educational gaming experience 
in  we introduced our leapster l max platform  which joins our leapster family 
the leapster l max system allows children to play action packed learning games  read electronic books  create works of art and watch interactive 
table of contents videos on both the handheld s screen and a television screen 
the platform leverages our leapster software library and our educational titles using licensed and non licensed content 
vtech is a competitor in the screen based category with their v 
smile and v 
smile pocket game platforms 
the v 
smile pocket is a portable  handheld educational gaming platform that competes directly with our leapster handheld while the v 
smile is a game console competing with our leapster l max system 
vtech  a hong kong based electronics company  is larger and more diversified than leapfrog 
as a result  we believe that vtech may have an advantage with respect to sourcing products and components that may enable them to provide a more rapid competitive response to the market 
in addition  we believe that our leapster family competes with other popular handheld and console game platforms with less educational focus  such as nintendo co  ltd  sony corporation s playstation and playstation portable and jakks pacific s plug and play controller 
with the introduction of our fly pentop computer  we have entered a new competitive arena 
the fly pentop computer is targeted at market for ages eight years and older 
this is an age group that no longer considers themselves children as they become more image conscious and often emulate older siblings 
our fly marketing plan has allowed us to begin to merchandise our products away from the toy aisle and other leapfrog branded products 
the fly pentop computer and associated products can be found at retail with other electronic products  and may therefore compete with other electronic devices marketed at tweens including cellular phones and mp music devices 
we believe that producers of smart mobile devices  such as personal digital assistants  non mobile game platforms and computer based software may be able to compete effectively in our primary markets by developing engaging educational products that run on their platforms 
many of these companies have significantly larger installed bases than we do 
in addition  a number of major hardware and software makers have developed pen based portable computers like the tablet pc that could compete with our new fly pentop computer 
consequently  competitors may include companies like apple computer  inc  fujitsu limited  hewlett packard company  microsoft corporation  palm  inc  sega corporation and toshiba 
our schoolhouse division competes in the us supplemental educational materials market 
we believe the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products in the school market are proven educational effectiveness  brand  features and price 
our schoolhouse division faces competition in the supplemental curriculum market from major textbook publishers such as harcourt a division of reed elsevier  houghton mifflin company  mcgraw hill  pearson plc and scholastic corporation  as well as electronic educational material and service providers such as knowledge adventure  compass learning  plato learning  inc  renaissance learning and riverdeep group plc 
in the future  large entertainment companies such as viacom international  inc and walt disney co 
may begin to target the school markets 
for a discussion of the possible effects that competition could have on our business  see item a risk factors if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  our sales and market share could decline 
seasonality leapfrog s business is highly seasonal  with our retail customers making a large percentage of all purchases during the back to school and traditional holiday seasons 
our business  being subject to these significant seasonal fluctuations  generally realizes the majority of our net sales and all of our net income during the third and fourth calendar quarters 
these seasonal purchasing patterns and production lead times cause risk to our business associated with the under production of popular items and over production of items that do not match consumer demand 
in addition  we have seen our customers managing their inventories more stringently  requiring us to ship products closer to the time they expect to sell to consumers  increasing our risk to meet the demand for specific products at peak demand times  or adversely impacting our own inventory levels by the need to pre build products to meet the demand 
for more information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations seasonality and quarterly results of operations and item a risk factors our 
table of contents business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season 
and if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our product to our customers in sufficient quantities  or if our inventory levels are too high  our operating results will be adversely affected 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we also retain independent contractors to provide various services  primarily in connection with our content development 
we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
in the first quarter of  we announced our realignment plan with a focus on restoring profitability  strengthening our infrastructure and business processes  and generating growth 
included in this realignment plan  we committed to a restructuring of our workforce and a reduction of approximately full time and temporary employees in the us consumer and international segments 
in the third quarter of  we completed this workforce reduction 
however  the reduction is partially offset by increased headcount in the schoolhouse division throughout the year as we invested in this division

risk factors our business and the results of its operations are subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the following is a description of some of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future financial performance 

table of contents if we fail to predict consumer preferences and trends accurately  develop and introduce new products rapidly or enhance and extend our existing core products  our sales will suffer 
sales of our platforms  related software and stand alone products typically have grown in the periods following initial introduction  but we expect sales of specific products to decrease as they mature 
for example  net sales of the classic leappad and my first leappad in our us consumer business peaked in and have been declining since 
therefore  the introduction of new products and the enhancement and extension of existing products  through the introduction of additional software or by other means  is critical to our future sales growth 
to remain competitive  we must continue to develop new technologies and products and enhance existing technologies and product lines  as well as successfully integrate third party technology with our own 
the successful development of new products and the enhancement and extension of our current products will require us to anticipate the needs and preferences of consumers and educators and to forecast market and technological trends accurately 
consumer preferences  and particularly children s preferences  are continuously changing and are difficult to predict 
in addition  educational curricula change as states adopt new standards 
in  we introduced a number of new platforms  stand alone products  interactive books and other software for each of our three business segments  including our fly pentop computer  which is targeted at an older age group of consumers than we have focused on in the past  and our leapster l max handheld for television based learning 
we cannot assure you that these products will be successful or that other products will be introduced or  if introduced  will be successful 
the failure to enhance and extend our existing products or to develop and introduce new products that achieve and sustain market acceptance and produce acceptable margins would harm our business and operating results 
our advertising and promotional activities may not be successful 
our products are marketed through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs 
our ability to sell product is dependent in part upon the success of such programs 
if we do not successfully market our products  or if media or other advertising or promotional costs increase  these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  our sales and market share could decline 
we currently compete primarily in the infant and toddler category  preschool category and electronic learning aids category of the us toy industry and  to some degree  in the overall us and international toy industry 
we believe that we are also beginning to compete  and will increasingly compete in the future  with makers of popular game platforms and smart mobile devices such as personal digital assistants 
our schoolhouse division competes in the us supplemental educational materials market 
each of these markets is very competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future 
many of our direct  indirect and potential competitors have significantly longer operating histories  greater brand recognition and substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to changes in consumer requirements or preferences or to new or emerging technologies 
they may also devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively in our markets 
our business depends on three retailers that together accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in  and of the us consumer segment sales  and our dependence upon a small group of retailers may increase 
wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted in the aggregate for approximately of our net sales in in  sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target 
table of contents accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
we expect that a small number of large retailers will continue to account for a significant majority of our sales and that our sales to these retailers may increase as a percentage of our total sales 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our retailers 
as a result  agreements with respect to pricing  shelf space  cooperative advertising or special promotions  among other things  are subject to periodic negotiation with each retailer 
retailers make no binding long term commitments to us regarding purchase volumes and make all purchases by delivering one time purchase orders 
if any of these retailers reduce their purchases from us  change the terms on which we conduct business with them or experience a future downturn in their business  our business and operating results could be harmed 
our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season 
sales of consumer electronics and toy products in the retail channel are highly seasonal  causing the substantial majority of our sales to retailers to occur during the third and fourth quarters 
in  approximately of our total net sales occurred during the latter half of the year 
this percentage of total sales may increase as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through just in time inventory management systems 
generally  retailers time their orders so that suppliers like us will fill the orders closer to the time of purchase by consumers  thereby reducing their need to maintain larger on hand inventories throughout the year to meet demand 
failure to predict accurately and respond appropriately to retailer and consumer demand on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations  or any disruption of consumer buying habits during this key period  would harm our business and operating results 
if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our product to our customers in sufficient quantities  or if our retailers inventory levels are too high  our operating results will be adversely affected 
the high degree of seasonality of our business places stringent demands on our inventory forecasting and production planning processes 
if we fail to meet tight shipping schedules  we could damage our relationships with retailers  increase our shipping costs or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost 
in order to be able to deliver our merchandise on a timely basis  we need to maintain adequate inventory level of the desired products 
if our inventory forecasting and production planning processes result in us manufacturing inventory levels in excess of the levels demanded by our customers  our operating results could be adversely affected due to additional inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
if the inventory of our products held by our retailers is too high  they will not place orders for additional products  which would unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results 
we depend on our suppliers for our components and raw materials  and our production or operating margins would be harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available 
some of the components used to make our products  including our application specific integrated circuits  or asics  currently come from a single supplier 
additionally  the demand for some components such as liquid crystal displays  integrated circuits or other electronic components is volatile  which may lead to shortages 
if our suppliers are unable to meet our demand for our components and raw materials and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price available from our current suppliers or an alternative source is prohibitive  our ability to maintain timely and cost effective production of our products would be seriously harmed and our operating results would suffer 
in addition  as we do not have long term agreements with our major suppliers  they may stop manufacturing our components at any time 

table of contents we rely on a limited number of manufacturers  virtually all of which are located in china  to produce our finished products  and our reputation and operating results could be harmed if they fail to produce quality products in a timely and cost effective manner and in sufficient quantities 
we outsource substantially all of our finished goods assembly  using several asian manufacturers  most of who manufacture our products at facilities in the guangdong province in the southeastern region of china 
we depend on these manufacturers to produce sufficient volumes of our finished products in a timely fashion  at satisfactory quality and cost levels and in accordance with our and our customers terms of engagement 
if our manufacturers fail to produce quality finished products on time  at expected cost targets and in sufficient quantities  our reputation and operating results would suffer 
in addition  as we do not have long term agreements with our manufacturers  they may stop manufacturing for us at any time  with little or no notice 
we may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our finished products and our business and operating results could be harmed 
increases in our component or manufacturing costs could reduce our gross margins 
cost increases for our components or manufacturing services  whether resulting from shortages of materials  labor or otherwise  including  but not limited to rising cost of materials  transportation  services  labor  commodity price increases and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations could negatively impact our gross margins 
because of market condition and other factors  we may not be able to offset any such increased costs by adjusting the price of our products 
any errors or defects contained in our products  or our failure to comply with applicable safety standards  could result in delayed shipments or rejection of our products  damage to our reputation and expose us to regulatory or other legal action 
we have experienced  and in the future may experience  delays in releasing some models and versions of our products due to defects or errors in our products 
our products may contain errors or defects after commercial shipments have begun  which could result in the rejection of our products by our retailers  damage to our reputation  lost sales  diverted development resources and increased customer service and support costs and warranty claims  any of which could harm our business 
individuals could sustain injuries from our products  and we may be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting from such injuries 
there is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed  or fall outside the scope of  our insurance coverage 
moreover  we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future 
we are subject to the federal hazardous substances act  the flammable fabrics act  regulation by the consumer product safety commission  or cpsc  and other similar federal  state and international rules and regulatory authorities 
our products could be subject to involuntary recalls and other actions by such authorities 
concerns about potential liability may lead us to recall voluntarily selected products 
any recalls or post manufacture repairs of our products could harm our reputation  increase our costs or reduce our net sales 
we have had significant challenges to our management systems and resources  particularly in our supply chain and information systems  and as a result we may experience difficulties managing our business 
in recent years  we grew rapidly  both domestically and internationally 
we have more than doubled our net sales from million in and million in during this period  the number of different products we offered at retail also increased significantly  and we have opened offices in canada  france  macau and mexico 
we now sell our products in over countries 
this expansion presented  and continues to present  significant challenges for our management systems and resources and has resulted in a significant adverse impact on our operating and financial results 
if we fail to improve and maintain management systems and resources sufficient to keep pace with our business needs  our operating results could continue to suffer 

table of contents we depend on key personnel  and we may not be able to hire  retain and integrate sufficient qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executives  technical  sales  marketing  manufacturing and administrative personnel 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
recruiting and retaining skilled personnel is highly competitive 
if we fail to retain  hire  train and integrate qualified employees and contractors  we will not be able to maintain and expand our business 
there can be no assurance that the members of our existing management team will be able to manage our company or our growth 
part of our compensation package includes stock and or stock options 
if our stock performs poorly  it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract key employees 
in addition  because we will be required to treat all stock based compensation as an expense beginning in fiscal  we may experience increased compensation costs 
changes in compensation packages or costs could impact our profitability and or our ability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel 
our international consumer business may not succeed and subjects us to risk associated with international operations 
we derived approximately of our net sales from markets outside the united states in in  we are planning to expand our international product offerings and markets 
however  these and other efforts may not help increase sales of our products outside the united states  or achieve expected margins 
our business is  and will increasingly be  subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally  including developing successful products that appeal to the international markets  political and economic instability  military conflicts and civil unrest  greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  transportation delays and interruptions  greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights  complications in complying with laws in varying jurisdictions and changes in governmental policies  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  currency conversion risks and currency fluctuations  and limitations  including taxes  on the repatriation of earnings 
any difficulty with our international operations could harm our future sales and operating results 
our future growth will depend in part on our education and training group  which may not be successful 
we launched our education and training group in june to deliver classroom instructional programs to the pre kindergarten through th grade school market and explore adult learning opportunities 
to date  the schoolhouse division  which accounts for substantially all of the results of our education and training segment  has incurred cumulative operating losses 
sales from our schoolhouse division s curriculum based products will depend principally on broadening market acceptance of those products  which in turn depends on a number of factors  including our ability to demonstrate to decision makers the usefulness of our products to supplement traditional teaching practices  
table of contents the willingness of teachers  administrators  parents and students to use products in a classroom setting from a company that may be perceived as a toy manufacturer  the effectiveness of our sales force  our ability to generate recurring revenue from existing customers through various marketing channels  and the availability of state and federal government funding to defray  subsidize or pay for the costs of our products which may be severely limited due to budget shortfalls and other factors 
if we cannot continue to increase market acceptance of our schoolhouse division s supplemental educational products  the division may not be able to sustain its recent operating profits and our future sales could suffer 
our intellectual property rights may not prevent our competitors from using our technologies or similar technologies to develop competing products  which could weaken our competitive position and harm our operating results 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technologies that are used in our learning platforms and related software 
we rely  and plan to continue to rely  on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
the contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property or deter independent third party development of similar technologies 
the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where we do not hold patents or trademarks or where the laws may not protect our intellectual property as fully as in the united states 
some of our products and product features have limited intellectual property protection  and  as a consequence  we may not have the legal right to prevent others from reverse engineering or otherwise copying and using these features in competitive products 
in addition  monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is costly  and any dispute or other litigation  regardless of outcome  may be costly and time consuming and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
however  if we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully  our rights could be diminished and our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
for additional discussion of litigation related to the protection of our intellectual property  see item legal proceedings 
leapfrog enterprises  inc v 
fisher price  inc 
and mattel  inc third parties have claimed  and may claim in the future  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights  which may cause us to incur significant litigation or licensing expenses or to stop selling some of our products or using some of our trademarks 
in the course of our business  we periodically receive claims of infringement or otherwise become aware of potentially relevant patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by other parties 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  may be costly and time consuming  and may divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
if we  our distributors or our manufacturers are adjudged to be infringing the intellectual property rights of any third party  we or they may be required to obtain a license to use those rights  which may not be obtainable on reasonable terms  if at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of some of our products or against the use of a trademark or copyright in the sale of some of our products 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all the liability that could be imposed 
for more information regarding this see item legal proceedings tinkers chance v 
leapfrog enterprises  inc 
table of contents we are subject to international  federal  state and local laws and regulations that could impose additional costs or changes on the conduct of our business 
we operate in a highly regulated environment in the us and international markets 
us federal  state and local governmental entities regulate many aspects of our business  including products and the importation of products 
such regulations may include accounting standards  taxation requirements  trade restrictions  safety and other administrative and regulatory restrictions 
compliance with or changes in these and other laws and regulations could impose additional costs on the conduct of our business  and failure to comply with these and other laws and regulations or changes in these and other laws and regulations may impose additional costs or cause us to change the conduct of our business 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation  arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 
we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations  litigation and arbitration disputes 
as the outcome of these matters is difficult to predict  it is possible that the outcomes of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the business 
for more information regarding litigation see item legal proceedings  in this report 
weak economic conditions  armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  labor strikes or public health issues could have a material adverse effect on our business 
weak economic conditions in the us or abroad as a result of lower consumer spending  lower consumer confidence  higher inflation  higher commodity prices  such as the price of oil  political conditions  natural disaster labor  strikes or other factors could negatively impact our sales or profitability 
furthermore  armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  or public health issues  whether in the us or abroad could cause damage and disruption to our company  our suppliers or our customers or could create political or economic instability  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
although it is impossible to predict the consequences of any such events  they could result in a decrease in demand for our product or create delay or inefficiencies in our supply chain  by making it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products to our customers  or for our manufacturers to deliver products to us  or suppliers to provide component parts 
notably  our us distribution centers  including our distribution center in fontana  california  our los gatos  california engineering office and our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past 
in addition to the factors noted above  our existing earthquake insurance relating to our distribution center may be insufficient and does not cover any of our other operations 
if we are unable to improve our system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our future financial results and our management may not be able to provide its report on the effectiveness of our internal controls as required by the sarbanes oxley act 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  and december  the assessment for identified a material weakness in our internal controls in our financial statement close process as of december  and the assessment identified material weaknesses in our internal controls for the areas of accounts receivable  information technology and cost of goods sold and inventory 
discussion of the weakness in and our responsive measures are summarized in item a 
controls and procedures of our form k 
although we received an unqualified opinion on our and financial statements  the efficacy of the steps we have taken to date and the steps we are still in the process of taking to improve the reliability of our financial statements in the future are subject to continued management review supported by confirmation and testing by our internal auditors  as well as oversight by the audit committee of our board of directors 
we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any 
table of contents failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date 
insufficient internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could result in the decrease of the market price of our class a common stock 
one stockholder controls a majority of our voting power as well as the composition of our board of directors 
holders of our class a common stock will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote 
our class a common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share  and our class b common stock entitles its holders to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
as of december   lawrence j 
ellison and entities controlled by him beneficially owned approximately million shares of our class b common stock  which represents approximately of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock 
as a result  mr 
ellison controls all stockholder voting power  including with respect to the composition of our board of directors and  through it  any determination with respect to our business direction and policies  including the appointment and removal of officers  any determinations with respect to mergers  other business combinations  or changes in control  our acquisition or disposition of assets  our financing activities  and the payment of dividends on our capital stock  subject to the limitations imposed by our credit facility 
this control by mr 
ellison could depress the market price of our class a common stock or delay or prevent a change in control of leapfrog 
the limited voting rights of our class a common stock could negatively affect its attractiveness to investors and its liquidity and  as a result  its market value 
the holders of our class a and class b common stock generally have identical rights  except that holders of our class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders 
the holders of our class b common stock have various additional voting rights  including the right to approve the issuance of any additional shares of class b common stock and any amendment of our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the rights of our class b common stock 
the difference in the voting rights of our class a common stock and class b common stock could diminish the value of our class a common stock to the extent that investors or any potential future purchasers of our class a common stock attribute value to the superior voting or other rights of our class b common stock 
provisions in our charter documents  delaware law and our credit facility agreement may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our class a common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent and the voting power associated with our class b common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used by our board of directors to affect a rights plan or poison pill that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer and may have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an 
table of contents acquisition of our company 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding voting stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in addition  under the terms of our credit agreement  we may need to seek the written consent of our lenders of the acquisition of our company 
our stockholders may experience significant additional dilution upon the exercise of options or issuance of stock awards 
as of december   there were outstanding awards under our equity incentive plans that could result in the issuance of approximately million shares of class a common stock 
to the extent we issue shares upon the exercise of any of options  performance based stock awards or other equity incentive awards issued under our equity incentive plan  investors in our class a common stock will experience additional dilution 
our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value 
all the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price

overview leapfrog s mission is to become the leading brand for quality  technology based educational products for home  school and work for all ages around the world 
we believe that leapfrog is in the early stage of accomplishing this mission 
to date  we have established our brand and products largely focused on infants  toddlers and children in preschool through grade school and primarily in the us retail market 
while we believe that leapfrog is  first and foremost  an educational products company  we use the toy form and price points to make learning fun and cost effective 
as a result  our sales in our us consumer and international segments  our largest business segments  currently are generated in the toy aisles of retailers 
we have sold the products of our education and training segment predominantly to educational institutions 
we design  develop and market technology based educational platforms  related interactive content research based curriculum  and stand alone products for sale to retailers  distributors and schools 
we operate three business segments  which we refer to as us consumer  international  and education and training 
for further information regarding our three business segments  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 

table of contents the market for toy retailers has seen  and continues to see  consolidation 
in addition to the traditional channel of specialty toy retailers  of which toys r us has become the major player  the mass market retail channel has grown in importance 
for example  wal mart  target and a number of regional mass market retailers have seen growth in their market shares within the us toy retail market 
the mass market retailers have certain competitive advantages in the highly seasonal toy market because they have the ability to dedicate a significant amount of shelf space to toys during the fall holiday season  and then reduce the allocated shelf space for toys during the rest of the year 
in addition  these mass market retailers have greater financial resources and lower operating expenses than traditional specialty toy retailers and have driven down pricing and reduced profit margins for us and other players in the retail toy industry 
we anticipate that the toy industry s dependence on mass market retailers will continue to grow 
partially as a result of the influence of the mass market retailers  toys r us conducted a strategic evaluation of its worldwide assets  and in july was acquired by a private investment group 
on january   toys r us announced it will close store locations and convert another locations into babies r us stores 
this restructuring will result in a reduction of the number of products that toys r us purchases from us  though the dollar impact is currently unknown 
our consolidated net sales in were million  an increase of million or compared to on a constant currency basis which assumes that foreign currency exchange rates were the same in as  total company net sales increased from to sales growth in our us consumer segment was partially offset by sales declines in our international and education and training segments 
the us consumer business grew primarily due to the introduction of our fly pentop computer and related software and accessories in the third quarter for the october product launch 
in addition  the us consumer segment experienced significant demand for our screen based products including the leapster l max system  which was introduced in the third quarter of these sales increases were partially offset by continuing declines in our leappad family of products in the us consumer segment 
our gross margins in increased by percentage points to in from in gross margins improved in all segments of the business  particularly in our us consumer segment 
gross margins improved in the us consumer segment primarily due to improved product mix  lower expense for excess and obsolete inventory and lower freight expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related employee benefits  legal fees  marketing expenses  systems costs  rent  office equipment  supplies and professional fees related to process improvements and sarbanes oxley compliance 
the increase was primarily due to higher legal expense attributable to enforcing our patents  higher consulting and auditing fees resulting from process improvements and other activities related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  as well as higher employee costs resulting from restructuring related charges from our leapfrog realignment plan 
our research and development expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with content development  product development and product engineering 
the decrease was primarily due to lower costs for the content and development of our fly pentop computer product in than in our advertising expense decreased by million  or  in compared to advertising expenses consist primarily of television advertising  cooperative advertising and in store displays 
the decrease was primarily due to our cost containment efforts  higher advertising costs in for printing and distribution of our us consumer catalogs  and higher in store leapster platform merchandising displays 
our depreciation and amortization expenses consist primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and capitalized website development costs and amortization of intangibles 
these expenses exclude depreciation of manufacturing tools and capitalized content development costs  which are classified in cost of sales 

table of contents our income from operations increased by million  from a loss of million in  to income of million in the increase was primarily driven by higher sales in our us consumer segment  lower research and development and advertising expenses  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
in our us consumer segment  we market and sell our products directly to national and regional mass market and specialty retailers as well as to other retail stores through sales representatives 
our us consumer segment is our most developed business  and is subject to significant seasonal influences  with the substantial majority of our sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
in  this segment represented approximately of our total net sales 
although we are expanding our retail presence by selling our products to bookstores and electronics and office supply stores  the vast majority of our us consumer sales are to a few large retailers 
net sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately of our us consumer segment sales in compared to in and in as a percentage of our consolidated net sales  combined net sales to wal mart including sam s club  toys r us and target accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
as we ended  inventory levels at our us retailers increased over the prior year  due in part to the stocking of the fly pentop computer  which was not carried in we believe overall retail inventories will be reduced in  which would unfavorably impact our sales 
in our international segment  we sell our products outside the united states directly to retailers and through various distribution and strategic arrangements 
we have four direct sales offices in the united kingdom  canada  france and mexico 
we also maintain various distribution and strategic arrangements in countries such as australia  japan  germany and korea among others 
the international segment represented approximately of our total net sales in in  we plan on expanding our language offerings of leapster and leapster l max into french and spanish  which would allow us to introduce new products into several existing markets 
our education and training segment  which is represented almost entirely by our schoolhouse division  currently targets the pre kindergarten through th grade school market in the united states  including sales directly to educational institutions  to teacher supply stores and through catalogs aimed at educators 
the education and training segment represented approximately of our total net sales in this segment experienced sales declines partially attributable to transitions in management and attrition of key sales personnel as a result of an investigation related to a transaction in a large school district 
by the end of  we had installed a new schoolhouse leadership team  including a new president  vice president of marketing and vice president of sales 
in addition we replaced approximately of our sales representatives 
leapfrog realignment plan in the first quarter of  we announced a three pronged company wide realignment initiative designed to address the following objectives restore profitability  strengthen our infrastructure and business processes  and generate growth 
key actions to restore profitability included reduced headcount in our us consumer and international segments by in the cost to achieve these workforce savings was approximately million 
beginning in the third quarter of 
table of contents we realized the full financial benefit of these workforce reductions  as well as other cost containment actions 
partially offsetting these cost reductions were investments to improve business processes and to grow our business 
specifically  we have increased headcount in our schoolhouse division  and we invested in technology  process improvements and in the marketing of our new products  including our fly pentop computer and leapster l max platform 
overall  our operating expenses declined by million in compared to  due to the cost reductions in research and development and advertising  offset by these investments 
embarked on a strategy to better leverage our assets and investments to improve returns 
this includes leveraging technology across products and platforms  utilizing our content assets and development tools across divisions  and realizing the global potential of the products from the outset of our product development planning cycle to minimize development costs and maximize sales and profitability 
key actions to strengthen our infrastructure and business processes included strengthened the organization with the hiring of new personnel at both the executive and non executive levels in our schoolhouse division and our supply chain  finance and information technology departments 
in january  we also hired a new general manager for our asian sourcing operations 
made improvements in our warehousing and distribution capabilities  which have improved our customer service levels in the united states 
began a multi year installation of oracle i  our enterprise resource planning  or erp  system 
the first phase  which included upgrading our financial systems  was completed in the third quarter of in addition to improving the quality and timeliness of the information available to make decisions  the upgraded financial systems helped remediate certain internal control issues identified and discussed in our form k 
the second phase of the oracle i implementation will be to improve our supply chain system 
planning has begun for this phase and implementation will begin in installed an integrated three year strategic planning process driven at the senior levels of the organization and accompanied by additional metrics  controls and monthly operating reviews 
we have completed our first three year strategic plan under this new process 
delivered new products to the market on time and meeting expectations 
both the leapster l max system and the fly pentop computer were shipped to our retailers on our original time line and at gross margins equal to our original plan 
implemented core teams organized around the four main product categories of the business  which are book based platforms  screen based platforms  fly pentop computer platform and stand alone products 
these cross functional teams are helping us maximize growth opportunities  reduce development time and expense  and deliver products to market on time and on budget 
key actions to generate growth included implemented an integrated three year strategic planning process which provides for directing investments toward high growth and profitable business priorities 
introduced the leapster l max in the third quarter  and in the fourth quarter introduced our fly pentop computer each primarily to the us consumer market 
while it is too soon to know the long term prospects for these products  sales of these products have resulted in incremental revenues for in addition  in we plan on expanding our language offerings in our screen based products to include french and spanish 
we believe that by continuing to develop and introduce technology platforms for new and broader markets  we will be able to grow our business over the long term 
although we have made significant progress in restoring profitability and improving business processes  there remains work to be completed and additional actions need to be taken to further strengthen our 
table of contents infrastructure and business processes 
we particularly need to make improvements that will restore growth to our schoolhouse and international operations and enhance our total supply chain operations 
in addition  we expect that us retailers will want to reduce their inventories  which would negatively impact our sales 
nonetheless  we are managing the business for the long term  investing in process improvements and research and development that should lead to improved profitability over the long term 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and reported disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  inventory valuation  intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on complex and subjective judgments often resulting from determining estimates about the impact of events and conditions that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant in affecting judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and title passes to the customer provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns  allowances for defective products  markdowns and other sales allowances for customer promotions 
a small portion of our revenue related to training and subscriptions is deferred and recognized as revenue over a period of one to months 
we deferred less than of net sales in  and allowances for accounts receivable we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts we believe will become uncollectible 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition  past collection history and aging of the accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of any of our customers deteriorates  resulting in impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide estimated allowances for product returns  chargebacks  promotions and defectives on product sales in the same period that we record the related revenue 
we estimate our allowances by utilizing historical information for existing products 
for new products  we estimate our allowances for product returns on specific terms for product returns and our experience with similar products 
we continually assess our historical experience and adjust our allowances as appropriate  and consider other known factors 
if actual product returns  chargebacks  promotions and defective products are greater than our estimates  additional allowances may be required 
historically  our estimated allowances for accounts receivables  returns  chargebacks  promotions and defectives have been adequate to cover actual charges 

table of contents we disclose our allowances for doubtful accounts on the face of the balance sheet 
our other receivable allowances include allowances for product returns  chargebacks  defective products and promotional markdowns 
these other allowances totaled million and million at december  and respectively 
the decrease in other receivable allowances was primarily due to lower allowance for price corrections  offset by higher promotional allowances 
these allowances are recorded as reductions of gross accounts receivable 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
our estimate of an allowance for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on our management s review of on hand inventories compared to their estimated future usage  demand for our products  anticipated product selling prices and products planned for discontinuation 
if actual future usage  demand for our products and anticipated product selling prices are less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
management monitors these estimates on a quarterly basis 
when considered necessary  management makes additional adjustments to reduce inventory to its net realizable value  with corresponding increases to cost of goods sold 
allowances for excess and obsolete inventory were million and million in and  respectively  and are recorded as a reduction of gross inventories 
valuation of work in process inventory is an estimation of our liability for products in production at the end of each fiscal period 
this estimation is based upon normal production lead times for products we have scheduled to receive in subsequent periods  plus a valuation of products we specifically know are either completed or delayed in production beyond the normal lead time flow 
to the extent that actual work in process differs from the company s estimates  inventory and accounts payable may need to be adjusted 
intangible assets intangible assets includes the excess purchase price over the cost of net assets acquired  or goodwill 
goodwill arose from our september  acquisition of substantially all the assets and business of our predecessor  leapfrog rbt  and our acquisition of substantially all the assets of explore technologies on july  our intangible assets had a net balance of million and million at december  and  respectively and is allocated to our us consumer segment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
at december  and  we had million of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we tested our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment during the fourth quarter by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values 
as a result of this assessment  we determined that no adjustments were necessary to the stated values 
intangible assets with other than indefinite lives include patents  trademarks and licenses  one of which is a ten year technology license agreement entered into in january to jointly develop and customize our optical scanning technology 
the determination of related useful lives and whether the intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require that adjustments be recorded to asset balances 
we review intangible assets  as well as other long lived assets  for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation programs include stock awards  restricted stock units  performance based equity awards and employee and non employee stock options 
for stock awards and restricted stock units  the market value of the awards at the time of grant is recorded in deferred compensation and is amortized to compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the vesting periods are generally three 
table of contents and four years  respectively 
the costs of performance based equity awards are accrued based on achieving pre established financial measures 
stock based compensation arrangements to non employees are accounted for using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to re measurement over the vesting terms 
we also grant stock options to certain of our employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price generally equal to the fair value of the shares on the date of grant 
we use the intrinsic value method to account for stock options 
accordingly  compensation expense is only recorded for those stock option grants whose exercise price is less than the fair value of the shares on the date of the grant 
we recorded million and million in and  respectively  of deferred compensation for new awards under our stock based compensation programs 
we recognized million  million and million of expense for stock based compensation in  and  respectively 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
our financial statements include sufficient accruals for probable future assessments that may result from the examination of federal  state or international tax returns 
our tax accruals  tax provision  deferred tax assets or income tax liabilities may be adjusted if there are changes in circumstances  such as changes in tax law  tax audits or other factors  which may cause management to revise its estimates 
the amounts ultimately paid on any probable future assessments may differ from the amounts accrued and may result in an increase or reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution

this was partially offset by higher sales of leapster and littletouch leappad platforms and software

our international segment s net sales increased by million  or  from million in to million in on a constant currency basis  net sales increased from to the favorable currency impact was due to the strength of the canadian dollar and the british pound  and to a lesser extent  the euro 
the increase in our international segment was primarily due to higher sales in the united kingdom and canada  and to a lesser extent  increased sales in france 
increases were primarily due to greater market penetration resulting from more localized products and increased brand awareness 
higher sales to distributors 
sales increased in australia due to an effective marketing campaign conducted by our distributor  which resulted in increased shelf space and brand awareness  and in  we entered into the german language market in europe 
a decrease in sales to korea due to the termination of our relationship with our primary distributor  which partially offset sales gains

education and training 
our education and training segment s net sales increased by million  or from million in to million in our schoolhouse division accounts for substantially all of the results of our education and training segment 
the increase in net sales in this segment was primarily due to larger orders resulting from the continued market penetration of this segment s flagship product  the leaptrack learning system

table of contents us consumer 
the percentage point decrease in our us consumer segment s gross profit percentage year over year was primarily the result of the following lower sales of products that carried a relatively high margin  such as leappad software and hardware  offset by growing sales in new  lower margin products  such as the leapster product line 
we were seeking to build a large base of installed leapster platform users that would lead to the sale of higher margin leapster software 
we estimated that the impact of this unfavorable product mix contributed to a five percentage point decline in the gross profit percentage in versus higher charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million over inventory reserves increased due to obsolete and defective inventory comprised of raw materials and discontinued finished goods 
the increase in reserves was due  at least in part  to significantly lower sales in the fourth quarter versus expectation for products to be discontinued in the increase in excess and obsolete inventories resulted in three percentage points of the decline in gross profit percentage in versus higher fixed expenses  in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  including higher warehousing and freight resulting from higher inventory levels  and higher depreciation of capitalized tooling expenses resulting from tooling write offs associated with discontinued products 
increased expenses were primarily attributed to operating inefficiencies incurred at our new distribution facility in fontana  california 
we estimated that these expenses contributed two percentage points of the decline in gross profit percentage in versus price reductions on our established platforms  primarily our classic leappad  which was implemented to drive future sales of these platforms and their related software products 
we estimated that these price reductions resulted in one percentage point of the decline in gross profit percentage in higher sales allowances granted to customers due to operational issues encountered during the start up of our new distribution facility 
we estimated that these allowances resulted in one percentage point of the decline in gross profit percentage in international 
the percentage point decrease in our international segment s gross profit percentage year over year was primarily due to a higher percentage of sales derived from lower margin platforms 
larger mix of lower margin sales to distributors as compared to higher margin sales direct to retailers 
higher fixed expenses  including warehousing and freight expenses resulting from higher levels of inventory 
education and training 
the three percentage point increase in our education and training segment s gross profit percentage year over year was primarily due to better net sales leverage achieved as the segment s fixed expenses represent a lower percentage of those sales  partially offset by lower margin ancillary services sold in conjunction with the leaptrack learning system

as discussed in the notes to our financial statements  in january we implemented a foreign exchange hedging program that is designed to minimize the impact of currency exchange rate movements on remeasurable balance sheet items 
this was partially offset by higher net interest income resulting from our larger average cash balances and higher interest rates on invested balances

net income loss net income loss decreased by million from income of million in to a loss of million in due to the above described factors 
as a percentage of net sales  net income loss decreased from in to in seasonality and quarterly results of operations leapfrog s business is highly seasonal  with our retail customers making a large percentage of all purchases in preparation for the traditional holiday season 
our business  being subject to these significant seasonal fluctuations  generally realizes the majority of our net sales and all of our net income during the third and fourth calendar quarters 
these seasonal purchasing patterns and production lead times cause risk to our business associated with the under production of popular items and over production of items that do not match consumer demand 
in addition we have seen our customers managing their inventories more stringently  requiring us to ship products closer to the time they expect to sell to consumers  increasing our risk to meet the demand for specific products at peak demand times  or adversely impacting our own inventory levels by the need to pre build products to meet the demand 
for more information  see item a 
risk factors our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season and if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our product to our customers in sufficient quantities  or if our or our retailers inventory levels are too high  our operating results will be adversely affected 
the following table sets forth unaudited quarterly statements of operations information for and the unaudited quarterly information includes all normal recurring adjustments that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
given the low sales volumes in the first half of the calendar year  and the relatively fixed nature of our operating expenses  historically  we have been profitable in our third and fourth quarters and unprofitable in our first and second quarters 
we expect that we will continue to incur losses during the first and second quarters of each year for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we were unprofitable in the fourth quarter of  due to higher sales allowances  higher operating expenses and higher expense for excess and obsolete inventory 
because of the seasonality of our business and other factors  results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of changes in accounting principle 
the statement requires the retroactive application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas does not change the guidance for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements or the change in an accounting estimate 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning 
table of contents after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r 
sfas r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method 
further  it eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb  and as allowed under the original provisions of sfas sfas r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
sfas r allows for either prospective recognition of compensation expense or retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
this statement also amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reflected as financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows 
the adoption of sfas r will change our accounting for employee stock option grants 
our accounting for non employee stock options  stock awards and restricted stock units is unchanged 
the adoption of sfas r is estimated to result in a compensation charge for fiscal year of approximately million based on current stock options grants outstanding

 inventory costs  or sfas sfas clarifies the accounting for unusual amounts of idle facility expense  freight handling costs and waste material spoilage 
the statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities
