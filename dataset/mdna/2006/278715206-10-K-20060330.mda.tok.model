the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency and interest rates 
the majority of the company s operations are based in the us and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  the company has operations in australia  canada  india  new zealand and singapore and conduct transactions in the local currencies of each location 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  revenues or financial condition

in and  the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment account  which is a component of stockholders equity  was an unrealized gain of  and  respectively 
the company considered the historical trends in currency exchange rate and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of for all currencies could be experienced in the near term 
such adverse changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its debt obligations and to its interest income as it relates to the outstanding cash balances 
as of december  the company had no debt outstanding related to its line of credit and the remaining debt is fixed 
while the company had interest rate risk related to its line of credit at december   the exposure was mitigated by the interest income on the restricted balance of  as of december   the company had no debt outstanding 
the company s market risk at december   is the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in pre tax income resulting from a hypothetical decrease in effective interest rates on the company s outstanding cash balance 
the company does not feel such a loss of interest income would be significant to its results of operations 
the company does not currently use any derivative financial instruments
