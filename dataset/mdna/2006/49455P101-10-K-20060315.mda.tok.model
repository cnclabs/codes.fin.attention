together  our limited partner and general partner interests represented approximately of kinder morgan energy partners total equity interests at december  we receive quarterly distributions on the i units owned by kinder morgan management in additional i units  a nd distributions on our other units in cash 
in addition to distributions received on our limited partner interests and our kinder morgan management shares as discussed above  we also receive an incentive distribution from kinder morgan energy partners as a result of our ownership of the general partner interest in kinder morgan energy partners 
this incentive distribution is calculated in increments based on the amount by which quarterly distributions to unit holders exceed specified target levels as set forth in kinder morgan energy partners partnership agreement  reaching a maximum of of distributions allocated to the general partner for quarterly distributions above per limited partner unit 
including both our general and limited partner interests in kinder morgan energy partners  at the distribution level  we received approximately of all quarterly distributions made by kinder morgan energy partners  of which approximately is attributable to our general partner interest and is attributable to our limited partner interest

all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
net cash flows from operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of million 
this negative variance is principally due to i a million increased use of working capital cash for hedging activities  due to increases in ngpl hedge volumes and natural gas prices  ii a million pension payment and an million postretirement benefit plan payment  both made during  iii a million increase in cash paid for income taxes during  iv a million increase in cash paid for interest during and v million of severance and other payments to employees resulting from the acquisition of terasen

these negative impacts were partially offset by i a million increase in cash distributions received in attributable to our interest in kinder morgan energy partners see the discussion following  ii a net increased source of cash of million for gas in underground storage and iii an increase of million in cash attributable to the change in the balance of deferred purchased gas costs 
cash flows attributable to deferred purchased gas costs vary with the relationship between the amount actually paid for natural gas and the amount currently included in regulated rates 
this difference is recovered or refunded through subsequent rate adjustments 
significant period to period variations in cash used or generated from gas in storage transactions are due to changes in injection and withdrawal volumes as well as fluctuations in natural gas prices 
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased from million in to million in  an increase of million 
this positive variance is principally due to i a million increase in cash distributions received in attributable to our interest in kinder morgan energy partners  ii a million reduction in cash paid for interest during  iii a million decrease in cash paid for income taxes during and iv an increase of million in cash attributable to the change in the balance of deferred purchased gas costs

total cash payments for dividends were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in these amounts are principally due to increases in the dividends declared per common share and  to a minor extent  to increased shares outstanding 
in january  we increased our quarterly common dividend to per share annualized 
on february   we paid a dividend at the increased rate of per share to shareholders of record as of january as discussed under business strategy elsewhere in this report  our intention is to maintain a capital structure that provides stability and flexibility  while returning value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
in recent periods  we have increased our common stock dividends in response to changes in income tax laws that have made dividends a more efficient way to return cash to our shareholders 
our board of directors generally considers our dividend policy annually in conjunction with its january meeting and has recently shown a pattern of increasing dividends 
the board considers a number of factors in reaching its decision with respect to dividend policy including our historical and projected cash flows  our expected allocation of funds to share repurchases  the opportunity to invest in attractive capital projects and  as discussed above  changes in laws that may affect the ta xation of dividends to our shareholders 
we currently expect that our cash flows will be adequate to maintain at least our current level of dividends for  although changes in our economic circumstances  in the economic circumstances of our industry or of the economy in general could cause the board to reconsider our dividend policy at any time 
litigation and environmental matters our anticipated environmental capital costs and expenses for  including expected costs for remediation efforts  are approximately million inclusive of terasen gas and kinder morgan canada  compared to approximately million of such costs and expenses incurred in not including any costs spent by terasen 
we had an environmental reserve of approximately million at december   to address remediation issues associated with approximately projects 
this reserve has not been discounted or reduced for expected insurance recoveries 
our reserve estimates range in value from approximately million to million  and the lower end of the range has been accrued as no amount within the range is considered more likely than any other 
in addition  we have recorded a receivable of million for expected cost recoveries that have been deemed probable 
our reserve is primarily establi shed to address and clean up soil and ground water impacts from former releases to the environment at facilities we have acquired 
reserves for each project are generally established by reviewing existing documents  conducting interviews and performing site inspections to determine the overall size and impact to the environment 
reviews are made on a quarterly basis to determine the status of the cleanup and evaluate the impacts of any significant developments and review item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
continued kmi form k the costs associated with the effort 
in assessing environmental risks in conjunction with proposed acquisitions  we review records relating to environmental issues  conduct site inspections  interview employees  and  if appropriate  collect soil and groundwater samples 
after consideration of reserves established  we believe that costs for environmental remediation and ongoing compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial position or results of operations or diminish our ability to operate our businesses 
however  there can be no assurances that future events  such as changes in existing laws  the promulgation of new laws  or the development or discovery of new or existing facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant unanticipated costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the following discussion should be read in conjunction with note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information on our risk management activities 
our derivative activities are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  collectively  statement we enter into derivative contracts solely for the purpose of hedging exposures that accompany our normal business activities 
in accordance with the provisions of statement  we designated these instruments as hedges of various exposures as discussed following  and we test the effectiveness of changes in the value of these hedging instruments in offsetting the risk being hedged 
hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in income in the period in which it occurs 
we enter into these transactions only with counterparties whose debt securities are rated investment grade by the major rating agencies 
while we will continue to enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
our businesses require that we purchase  sell and consume natural gas 
specifically  we purchase  sell and or consume natural gas i to serve our regulated natural gas distribution sales customers in the us item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
continued kmi form k and canada  ii to serve certain of our retail natural gas distribution customers in areas where regulatory restructuring has provided for competition in natural gas supply  for customers who have selected the company as their supplier of choice under our choice gas program  iii as fuel in one of our colorado power generation facilities  iv as fuel for compressors located on ngpl s pipeline system and v for operational sales of gas by ngpl 
with respect to item iii  our exposure is minimal and primarily consists of basis rather than commodity risk 
with respect to item iv  this fuel is supplied by in kind fuel recoveries that are part of the transportation tariff 
item i gives rise to natural gas commodity price risk that is passed through to our customers as the retail gas distribution regulatory structures provide for such 
the gas distribution operations under terasen use derivatives to manage natural gas commodity price risk that is passed to customers 
items ii and v give rise to natural gas commodity price risk which we have chosen to subst antially mitigate through our risk management program 
we provide this mitigation through the use of financial derivative products  and we do not utilize these derivatives for any purpose other than risk mitigation 
under our choice gas program  customers in certain areas served by kinder morgan retail are allowed to choose their natural gas supplier from a list of qualified suppliers  although the transportation of the natural gas to the homes and businesses continues to be provided by kinder morgan retail in all cases 
when those customers choose kinder morgan retail as their choice gas supplier  we enter into agreements providing for sales of gas to these customers during a one year period at fixed prices per unit  but variable volumes 
we mitigate the risk associated with these anticipated sales of gas by purchasing natural gas futures contracts on the new york mercantile exchange nymex and  as applicable  over the counter basis swaps to mitigate the risk associated with the difference in price changes between henry hub nymex basis and the expected physical delivery location 
in addition  we mitigate a porti on of the volumetric risk through the purchase of over the counter natural gas options 
the time period covered by this risk management strategy does not extend beyond one year 
as to the retail gas distribution operations under terasen gas  the majority of natural gas supply contracts have floating  rather than fixed prices 
natural gas price swap contracts at aeco and huntingdon are used to fix the effective purchase price 
any differences between the effective cost of natural gas purchased and the price of natural gas included in rates are recorded in deferral accounts  and subject to regulatory approval  are passed through in future rates to customers 
terasen gas price risk management strategy covers a term of months and aims to i improve the likelihood that natural gas prices remain competitive with electricity rates  ii dampen price volatility on customer rates and iii reduce the risk of regional price disconnects 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  includes a net deferral of million reported under the caption current liabilities other representing net losses as a result of ineffectiveness of these hedges that are recoverable from customers through rates 
with respect to operational sales of natural gas made by ngpl  we are exposed to risk associated with changes in the price of natural gas during the periods in which these sales are made 
we mitigate this risk by selling natural gas futures and  as discussed above  over the counter basis swaps  on the nymex in the periods in which we expect to make these sales 
in general  we do not hedge this exposure for periods in excess of months 
our value at risk model  excluding terasen as discussed following  is used to measure the risk of price changes in the crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids markets 
value at risk is a statistical measure of how much the marked to market value of a portfolio could change during a period of time  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we use a closed form model to evaluate risk on a daily basis 
our value at risk computations use a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
continued kmi form k amount presented 
during  value at risk reached a high of million and a low of million 
value at risk at december   was million and  based on quarter end values  averaged million for exclusive of terasen risk management activities as discussed following  our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivatives assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed preceding  we enter into these derivatives solely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany our normal business activities and  therefore  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivatives is  with the exception of hedging inefficiency  offset by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
we have not included terasen natural gas commodity price risk in our value at risk model 
we acquired terasen effective november  historically terasen has not been required to provide this information in its disclosure and therefore does not currently have the ability to calculate it 
in addition  the derivatives are not entered into for trading purposes  but to hedge underlying physical risk  as is the case with all of kinder morgan  inc s derivative activity  and all commodity price risk is passed through to the customers 
it is our intention to incorporate terasen s derivatives into the company s value at risk model in the future 
for purposes of the current disclosure  we have run a sensitivity analysis assuming a c increase and decrease in the forward price curve of natural gas as of december   or approximately a change in price 
the portfolio consists of a combination of approximately swaps and approximately options based on a total notional value of approximately million c million with an average strike price of approximately gj c gj 
the portfolio mark to market at december  was approximately million c million 
an gj c gj increase in the forward curve resulted in approximately a million c million mark to market or approximately a million c million increase 
an gj c gj decrease in the forward curve resulted in approximately a million c million mark to market  or approximately a million c million decrease 
apart from our derivatives for retail distribution gas supply contracts under terasen gas  during the three years ended december   all of our natural gas derivative activities were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges 
we recognized a pre tax loss of approximately  in  a pre tax loss of approximately  in and a pre tax gain of approximately  in as a result of ineffectiveness of these hedges  which amounts are reported within the captions natural gas sales and gas purchases and other costs of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
there was no component of these derivative instruments gain or loss excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness 
as the hedged sales and purchases take place and we record them into earnings  we also reclassify the gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 
we expect to reclassify into earnings  during  substantially all of the balance of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income representing unrecognized net losses on derivative activities at december  during the three years ended december   we reclassified no gains or losses into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges due to a determination that the forecasted transactions would no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period 
we also provide certain administrative risk management services to kinder morgan energy partners  although kinder morgan energy partners retains the obligations and rights arising from all derivative item a

in order to mitigate that risk  we routinely monitor the credit status of our existing and potential customers

note g of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements provides information on the amount of prepayments we have received
