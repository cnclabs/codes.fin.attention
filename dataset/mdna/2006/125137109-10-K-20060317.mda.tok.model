critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
self insurance the company estimates its liability for incurred but unsettled general liability and workers compensation related claims under its self insured retention programs  including reported losses in the process of settlement and losses incurred but not reported 
the estimate is based on loss development factors determined through actuarial methods using the actual claim loss experience of the company subject to adjustment for current trends 
revisions to the estimated liability resulting from ongoing periodic reviews are recognized in the period in which a material difference is identified 
significant increases in general liability and workers compensation claim losses could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives and recoverability of its depreciable assets based on factors including historical experience  the expected beneficial service period of the asset  the quality and durability of the asset and the company s maintenance policy including periodic upgrades 
changes in useful lives are made on a prospective basis  unless factors indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows and an impairment write down is necessary 
lease accounting the company uses a consistent lease period generally  the initial non cancelable lease term plus renewal option periods provided for in the lease that can be reasonably assured when calculating depreciation of leasehold improvements and in determining straight line rent expense and classification of its leases as either an operating lease or a capital lease 
the lease term and straight line rent expense commences on the date when the company takes possession and has the right to control use of the leased premises 
funds received from the lessor intended to reimburse the company for the costs of leasehold improvements is recorded as a deferred credit resulting from a lease incentive and amortized over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense 
new accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the guidance requires rental costs for operating leases during the construction period to be recognized as rental expense 
the guidance permits either retroactive or prospective treatment for periods beginning after december  the company currently complies with this guidance and  therefore  the application of fsp did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf  determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination 
the guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after june  the company currently complies with this guidance and  therefore  adoption of eitf does not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires retrospective application  or the latest practical date  as the preferred method to report a change in accounting principle or correction of an error 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  fin 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by fin are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  under apb opinion no 
 no stock based compensation cost has been reflected in the net income of the company for grants of stock options to employees 
beginning in the first quarter of  the company will recognize compensation expense in its financial statements based on the fair value of all share based payments to employees 
sfas no 
r also changes the accounting for the tax effects of options  including the presentation of the tax effects on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the future impact of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted 
however  had sfas r been adopted in prior periods  the effect would have approximated the sfas pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures 
inflation the company s cost of operations  including but not limited to labor  food products  supplies  utilities  financing and rental costs  are significantly affected by inflationary factors 
the company pays most of its part time employees rates that are related to federal and state mandated minimum wage requirements 
management anticipates that any increases in federally mandated minimum wage would result in higher costs to the company  which the company expects may be partially offset by menu price increases and increased efficiencies in operations 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities decreased to million in from million in cash outflows from investing activities for were million  primarily related to capital expenditures 
net cash outflows from financing activities for were million  primarily related to the repurchase of the company s common stock
