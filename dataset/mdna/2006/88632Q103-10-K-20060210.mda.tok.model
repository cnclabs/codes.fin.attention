executive overview our suite of business integration and process management software solutions makes us a leading enabler of real time business 
we use the term real time business to mean doing business in such a way that organizations can use current information to execute their critical business processes and make smarter decisions 
we are the successor to a portion of the business of teknekron software systems  inc teknekron developed software  known as the tib technology  for the integration and delivery of market data  such as stock quotes  news and other financial information  in trading rooms of large banks and financial services institutions 
in  teknekron expanded its development efforts to include solutions designed to enable complex and disparate manufacturing equipment and software applications  primarily in the semiconductor fabrication market  to communicate within the factory environment 
teknekron was acquired by reuters group plc  the global information company  in following the acquisition  continued development of the tib technology was undertaken to expand its use in the financial services markets 
in january  our company  tibco software inc  was established as an entity separate from teknekron 
we were formed to create and market software solutions for use in the integration of business information  processes and applications 
in connection with our establishment as a separate entity  reuters transferred to us certain assets and liabilities related to our business and granted to us a royalty free license to the intellectual property from which some of our messaging software products originated 
in june  we acquired staffware plc  a provider of bpm solutions that enable businesses to automate  refine and manage their processes 
the addition of staffware s bpm solutions enabled us to offer our combined customer base an expanded real time business integration solution  by making it easier for our customers to utilize their existing systems through real time information exchange and automation and management of enterprise business processes regardless of where such processes reside 
bpm enables companies to save time 
table of contents and money by driving costs and time out of business processes for example  reducing error rates or manual steps  while at the same time ensuring that business processes are compliant with internal procedures and external regulations 
our acquisition of staffware also increased our distribution capabilities through the cross selling of products into new geographic regions  as well as an expanded customer and partner base 
our products are currently licensed by companies worldwide in diverse industries such as financial services  telecommunications  retail  healthcare  manufacturing  energy  transportation  logistics  government and insurance 
we sell our products through a direct sales force and through alliances with leading software vendors and systems integrators 
our revenue consists primarily of license and maintenance fees from our customers and distributors 
in addition  we receive fees from our customers for providing consulting services 
we also receive revenue from our strategic relationships with business partners who embed our products in their hardware and networking systems as well as from systems integrators who resell our products 
first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
maintenance revenue is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically twelve months 
consulting and training revenues are typically recognized as the services are performed  which services are usually performed on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of our products and generally do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
our revenue is generally derived from a diverse customer base 
no single customer represented greater than of total revenue for the year ended november  or as of november   no single customer had a balance in excess of of our net accounts receivable 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of collectibility and an allowance for returns and discounts based on specifically identified credits and historical experience 
relationship with reuters reuters is a distributor of our products to customers in the financial services segment 
pursuant to the terms of our license  maintenance and distribution agreement with reuters  reuters has the right to distribute certain of our products in conjunction with the sale by reuters to end users of its market data delivery solutions for a specified period of time 
we have the right to market and sell our products  other than risk management and market data distribution products  directly and through third party resellers other than a few specified resellers to customers in the financial services market 
the limitations on our ability to sell risk management and market data distribution products and on reselling through the specified resellers will expire in may in addition  reuters may embed our products in its solutions 
as of november   reuters owned less than of our outstanding common stock 
during fiscal year  reuters reduced its holdings such that as of november   reuters owned less than of our outstanding common stock 
revenue from reuters was million  or of our total revenue  in fiscal year critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended november  we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include the following revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts  stock based compensation  valuation and impairment of investments  goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  restructuring and integration costs  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by aicpa statement of position revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products and maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
revenue on shipments to resellers  when subject to certain rights of return and price protection  is recognized when the products are sold by the resellers to the end user customer and is recorded net of related costs to the resellers 
providing all other revenue criteria are met  non refundable  prepaid fees from oem customers are generally recognized upon delivery and on going royalty fees are generally recognized upon receipt of royalty reports of units shipped 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured at the time of the transaction 
in determining whether the fee is fixed or determinable we compare the payment terms of the transaction to our normal payment terms 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable and recognize revenue as the payments become due 
we assess whether collection is reasonably assured based on a number of factors  including the customer s past transaction history and credit worthiness 
generally  we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
for such arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values of ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based on separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts when the quoted renewal rates are deemed to be substantive 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support period 
fair value of services  such as consulting or training  is based upon separate sales of these services 
consulting and training services are generally billed based on hourly or daily rates and revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
consulting services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of our products and generally do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
the determination as to whether services involve significant production  modification or customization of the underlying software code is a matter of judgment and can materially impact the timing of revenue recognition 
many customers who license our software also enter into separate professional services arrangements with us 
in determining whether professional services revenue should be accounted for separately from license revenue  we evaluate  among other factors  the nature of our software products  whether they are ready for use by 
table of contents the customer upon receipt  the nature of our implementation services  which typically do not involve significant customization to or development of the underlying software code  the availability of services from other vendors  whether the timing of payments for license revenue is coincident with performance of services and whether milestones or acceptance criteria exist that affect the realizability of the software license fee 
substantially all of our professional services arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and accordingly  are recognized as the services are performed 
contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees are recognized on a proportional performance basis 
if there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for professional services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
training revenue is recognized as training services are delivered 
for arrangements that do not qualify for separate accounting for the license and professional services revenues  including arrangements that involve significant modification or customization of the software  that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees  or where payment for the software license is tied to the performance of professional services  software license revenue is generally recognized together with the professional services revenue using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized is equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated total contract costs  based on current estimates of costs to complete the project 
if the total estimated costs to complete a project exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss would be recognized currently 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result 
allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on our review of credit profiles of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  current economic trends and historical payment  return and discount experience 
we reassess the allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts each period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
however  unexpected events or significant future changes in trends could result in a material impact to our future statements of operations and of cash flows 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue or bad debt expense recognized could result 
our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues were  and in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of activities during the years reported 
based on our results for the year ended november   a one percentage point deviation in our allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in an increase or decrease in expense of approximately million 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation related to employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
and have adopted the disclosure provisions of the statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and sfas accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas had we accounted for stock based compensation related to employee stock based compensation plans using the fair value method as prescribed by sfas  our net income would have been reduced by million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
also see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we account for stock based compensation related to stock options granted to consultants based on the fair value estimate using the black scholes option pricing model on the date of grant and as remeasured at each reporting date in compliance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
as a result  stock based compensation expense fluctuates as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
compensation expense is amortized using the multiple option approach in compliance with the 
table of contents financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
pursuant to fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 options assumed in a purchase business combination are valued at the date of acquisition at their fair value calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of assumed options is included as a component of the purchase price 
the intrinsic value attributable to unvested options is recorded as unearned stock based compensation and amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas  which we have provided in note to the consolidated financial statements  will no longer be an acceptable alternative to recognition of expenses in the financial statements 
due to the amendment to rule a issued in april  sfas r must be adopted by the first interim reporting period of the fiscal year that begins on or after june  accordingly  we are required to adopt sfas r starting in our first quarter of fiscal year we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material adverse impact on our net income and our net income per share by decreasing our net income by the additional amount of such stock based compensation charges  net of taxes 
we cannot quantify the amount of such impact at this time 
valuation and impairment of investments 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
as of november   million of marketable securities have been classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
marketable securities are presented as current assets as they are subject to use within one year in current operations 
realized gains and losses are recognized based on the specific identification method 
as of november   gross unrealized losses on our investment portfolio totaled million 
the decline in value of these investments is primarily related to changes in interest rates and is considered temporary in nature 
our investments also include minority equity investments in privately held companies that are generally carried at cost basis and included in other assets on the balance sheet 
the fair value of these investments is dependent on the performance of the companies in which we invested  as well as the volatility inherent in external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment  we consider these factors as well as each of the companies cash position  earnings revenue outlook  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  we write down the investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss on investments in our consolidated statement of operations 
in fiscal year  we did not recognize any impairment loss  while in fiscal years and  we recognized impairment losses of million and million  respectively  relating to the other than temporary decline in value of certain equity investments 
as of november   the net carrying value of our minority equity investments totaled million 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether an other than temporary decline in the value of our investments exists 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective 
changes in our assessment of the valuation of our investments could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions do not materialize or change 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill and intangible assets result from our corporate acquisition transactions 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted on december   goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are instead tested for impairment at least annually or as circumstances indicate their value may no longer be recoverable 
we generally perform our annual impairment test at the end of the fiscal year 
as we 
table of contents operate our business in one reporting segment  our goodwill is tested for impairment at the enterprise level 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
for the first step  we screen for impairment  and if any possible impairment exists  we undertake a second step of measuring such impairment 
other purchased intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  and periodically tested for impairment 
as of november   we had million of goodwill and million of intangible assets  and had not recorded any impairment charges 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets 
changes in the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets could be substantial 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
we have not recorded any impairment losses to date 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets 
changes in the valuation of long lived assets could be substantial 
restructuring and integration costs 
our restructuring charges are comprised primarily of costs related to properties abandoned in connection with facilities consolidation  related write down of leasehold improvements and severance and associated employee termination costs related to headcount reductions 
for restructuring actions initiated prior to december   we followed the guidance provided by eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
we recorded the liability related to these termination costs when the plan was approved  the termination benefits were determined and communicated to the employees  the number of employees to be terminated  their locations and job were specifically identified  and the period of time to implement the plan was set 
for restructuring actions initiated after january   we adopted sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
our restructuring charges included accruals for estimated losses on facility costs based on our contractual obligations net of estimated sublease income based on current comparable market rates for leases 
we reassess this liability periodically based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions  such as the timing and amounts of sublease rental income  either change or do not materialize 
should facilities operating lease rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate by approximately million 
accounting for income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need 
table of contents for the valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
the available positive evidence at november  included three years of historical operating profits and a projection of future income limited to three years which coincides with the period over which we recorded historical operating profits  due to our lack of visibility into earnings further into the future 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  we recorded a partial release of valuation allowance during fiscal year we continue to closely monitor available evidence and may adjust our valuation allowance in future periods 
as of november   we believed that the amount of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the partial release of valuation allowance would ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
if we have to re establish the full valuation allowance  it may result in a charge of million to the tax provision 
of the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million as of november   we estimate that when released  approximately million will result in an income tax benefit  approximately million will be credited to goodwill and approximately million relating to stock option exercises and related tax credits will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
we have completed an r d credit study for fiscal years through as a result  additional credits have been identified and included in the deferred tax assets as of november  r d credit carryforwards are approximately million and million  for federal and california  respectively 
us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for on a cumulative total of million of undistributed earnings for certain non us subsidiaries 
with the exception of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  net undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are generally considered to be indefinitely reinvested  and accordingly  no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  the company will be subject to us income taxes net of available foreign tax credits associated with these earnings

table of contents total revenue year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages total revenue total revenue increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a increase in service and maintenance revenue  offset by a decrease in license revenue 
geographically  our total revenue increased by million or in the united states  million or in europe and million or in the pacific rim in fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on total revenue by region 
since june  our consolidated results of operations have included incremental revenue and costs related to the former staffware operations 
consequently  such incremental revenue has been included in our results for the second half of fiscal year and fiscal year pro forma results as if we had acquired staffware at the beginning of fiscal year are provided in note to our consolidated financial statement 
due to the structure of our multi product enterprise license agreements  which often combine tibco and staffware products  we are not able to separately report the portion of revenue attributable solely to the staffware components 
total revenue increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily due to incremental revenue from staffware during fiscal year  our direct sales to customers in the financial services market beginning in october pursuant to our agreement with reuters and a general increase in information technology spending by our customers 
revenue from reuters was million  million and million representing  and of our total revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
until march  our revenue from reuters consisted primarily of fees under our license agreement  which includes minimum guaranteed fees of million per quarter  reduced by an amount equal to of the license and maintenance revenues from our sales to financial services companies and  until october  also reduced by of our maintenance revenue from customers who were transitioned to us by reuters 
license revenue and costs year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages license revenue as a percentage of total revenue cost of license revenue as a percentage of total revenue as a percentage of license revenue we license a wide range of products to customers in various industries and geographic regions 
cost of license revenue mainly consisted of royalties and amortization of developed technology acquired through corporate acquisitions 
license revenue decreased by million or for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a decrease in revenue from the telecommunications  consumer packaged goods and manufacturing sectors  partially offset by an increase in license revenue from the financial services market 
license revenue increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  primarily due to increased revenue from the financial services  consumer packaged goods  telecommunications and manufacturing sectors  and also due to additional revenue generated from the staffware acquisition 

table of contents the total number of license revenue transactions over  increased to in fiscal year  from in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the average deal size for transactions over  was approximately million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the number of transactions equal to or greater than million was  and transactions in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our total license revenue in any particular period is to a certain extent  dependant on the size and timing of larger license deals 
we expect the number of license transactions over  to increase in fiscal year  while the size and timing of any particular multi million dollar deal is more difficult to forecast 
cost of license revenue mainly consisted of royalty costs and amortization of developed technology acquired through corporate acquisitions 
cost of license revenue remained approximately of total revenue and to of license revenue in each of fiscal years  and as stated above  our fiscal year financial results include incremental revenue and costs attributable to former staffware operations  whereas  our fiscal year financial results only include such revenue and costs from june we expect license revenues to be approximately to of our total revenue and cost of license revenue to remain approximately to of license revenue in fiscal year service and maintenance revenue and costs year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages service and maintenance revenue as a percentage of total revenue cost of service and maintenance revenue as a percentage of total revenue as a percentage of service and maintenance revenue service and maintenance revenue increased million or for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  and increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was comprised of million  or a increase in consulting and training services revenue  and million  or a increase in maintenance revenue 
the increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was comprised of million  or a increase in consulting and training services revenue  and million  or a increase in maintenance revenue 
consulting revenue increased due to more comprehensive and larger engagements with respect to a number of accounts and an increased focus on providing more services to customers 
maintenance revenue increased primarily due to growth in our installed software base and our acquisition of staffware in third quarter of fiscal year and objectstar in the second quarter of fiscal year also  in accordance with our agreement with reuters  we began providing maintenance and support services directly to customers transitioned from reuters in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which contributed to our growth in service and maintenance revenue in fiscal year cost of service and maintenance revenue consists primarily of compensation of professional services and customer support personnel and third party contractors  and associated expenses related to providing consulting services 
the cost of service and maintenance revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue throughout the three years ended november   as the relative proportion of consulting revenue increased 
the increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year as compared to the prior year resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million related to personnel compensation  million for third party contractor compensation and consulting fees  and million in travel costs 
increased compensation cost was primarily 
table of contents due to an increase in professional services and customer support staff during the year 
increased third party contractor and consulting fees were also directly related to increased service revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars of cost of service and maintenance revenue in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million related to personnel compensation  million for third party contractor compensation and consulting fees  and million in travel costs 
we expect service and maintenance revenue to be approximately to of total revenue in fiscal year we expect the cost of service and maintenance revenue to increase in absolute dollars and in line with increasing service and maintenance revenue 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  our cost of service and maintenance will include significant share based compensation expense calculated using the fair value method as required by sfas r  however  we cannot quantify the amount of such increase at this time 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation  third party contractor fees and related costs associated with the development and enhancement of our suite of products 
year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenue the increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in personnel compensation as a result of headcount increases both from our acquisitions and our establishment of a new research and development center in india 
the remainder of the increase in research and development expenses included increased travel expenses  depreciation of equipment and software and various license fees 
our fiscal year financial results include incremental costs attributable to former staffware operations  whereas  our fiscal year financial results only include such costs from june the decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million decrease in third party contractor fees and a million reduction of facility cost expenses  partially offset by a million increase in personnel compensation 
the reduction in third party contractor fees was largely the result of renegotiated agreements with various third party contractors 
the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june also contributed to the reduction of facility expenses in fiscal year personnel compensation increased in fiscal year due to an increase in headcount primarily as a result of the staffware acquisition  and an increase in variable incentive compensation 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  we expect that spending on research and development will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  our research and development expenses will include significant share based compensation expense calculated using the fair value method as required by sfas r  however  we cannot quantify the amount of such increase at this time 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs of our direct sales force and marketing staff  the cost of marketing programs  including customer conferences  promotional materials  trade shows and advertising  and related travel expenses 
year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in personnel compensation  a million increase in travel expenses  a million increase in facility expenses  partially offset by a million reduction in commission expenses and a million decrease in sales referral fees 
the increase in personnel compensation was due to an increase in headcount 
the lower sales commission resulted from a lower effective rate on commissionable revenue and lower license revenue 
our fiscal year financial results include incremental costs attributable to former staffware operations  whereas  our fiscal year financial results only include such costs from june the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in personnel compensation  a million increase in commission expense and a million increase in travel expenses  partially offset by a million decrease in marketing program costs and a million reduction of facility expenses 
the increase in personnel compensation was due to an increase in headcount  most significantly in europe  primarily as a result of the staffware acquisition 
the higher sales commission was a result of higher commissionable revenue 
the reduction in marketing program costs was due to more specific and targeted advertising efforts 
the reduction in facility expenses was attributable to the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june we intend to selectively increase staff in our direct sales organization and to increase our marketing efforts in the coming year and  accordingly  expect that sales and marketing expenditures will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  our sales and marketing expenses will include significant share based compensation expense calculated using the fair value method as required by sfas r  however  we cannot quantify the amount of such increase at this time 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive  legal  finance  accounting and human resources 
year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in personnel compensation and an million increase in consulting and outside services  offset by reductions in other administrative costs 
increased headcount contributed to total higher personnel costs 
consulting and outside services increased substantially  due to our continuous effort to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act sarbanes oxley  and increased legal  tax consulting and other professional fees 
our fiscal year financial results include the incremental costs attributable to former staffware operations  whereas  our fiscal year financial results only include such costs from june 
table of contents the increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an million increase in personnel compensation  a million increase in consulting and outside services and a million increase in travel expenses  offset by a million reduction in facility expenses  and reductions in other administrative costs 
increased headcount together with an increase in variable incentive compensation contributed to total higher personnel costs 
consulting and outside services increased due to our initiatives to comply with sarbanes oxley 
the reduction in facility expenses was attributable to the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june we will continue to invest in improving our corporate infrastructure to enhance effective management and internal controls and therefore expect that general and administrative spending will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal year beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  our general and administrative expenses will include significant share based compensation expense calculated using the fair value method as required by sfas r  however  we cannot quantify the amount of such increase at this time 
stock based compensation we accounted for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense principally relates to employee stock options assumed in acquisitions and stock options granted to consultants 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to consultants is recognized as earned using the multiple option method and is recorded by expense category 
at each reporting date  we re measure consultant stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
as a result  stock based compensation expense will fluctuate 
the stock based compensation expenses have been incorporated into the respective cost or expense lines in the consolidated income statement  and are not separately shown on the consolidated income statement because such amounts were insignificant in fiscal year and the following table summarizes the expenses year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages stock based compensation expenses in cost of revenue in operating expenses total stock based compensation expenses as a percentage of total revenue the decrease in stock based compensation was mainly the result of continuous amortization of unearned stock based compensation cost brought forward from prior years  with minimal additions 
as prescribed by sfas r issued in december  we will be required to recognize the compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions in our financial statements  using the fair value method  starting from our first fiscal quarter of we expect the adoption of sfas r will increase our share based compensation expense significantly  however we cannot quantify the amount of such increase at this time 
acquired in process research and development year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages acquired in process research and development expenses  n a as a percentage of total revenue 
table of contents in fiscal year  we estimated that million of the purchase price of staffware represented acquired in process research and development iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisition 
we calculated the value of iprd by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion 
in determining the value ultimately assigned to iprd we considered the stage of completion  complexity of work to date  difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred and the expected cost to complete the project 
as of november   we had substantially completed the staffware projects that were in process at the date of the acquisition 
restructuring charge year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages restructuring charge as a percentage of total revenue during fiscal year  we initiated a restructuring plan designed to re align our resources and cost structure  and accordingly recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million for the resulting workforce reduction 
the restructuring plan eliminated employees  across all functions and primarily in our european operations 
as of november   all such employees have been terminated and of the million restructuring charge  million was paid  and the remaining million accrual is expected to be utilized in fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded million in restructuring charges related to properties vacated in connection with facilities consolidation 
the additional facilities charges resulted from revisions to our estimates of future sublease income due to further deterioration of real estate market conditions 
the estimated facility costs were based on our contractual obligations  net of estimated sublease income  based on current comparable rates for leases in their respective markets 
should facilities rental rates continue to decrease in these markets or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate by up to million 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a reduction in headcount to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
this reduction of approximately employees was comprised of sales and marketing staff  general and administrative staff  and research and development staff 
all severance actions were completed by august  also see note accrued restructuring and integration costs to our consolidated financial statements 
amortization of acquired intangible assets intangible assets acquired through corporate acquisitions are comprised of the estimated value of developed technologies  patents  trademarks  established customer bases  non compete agreements  as well as maintenance and oem customer royalty agreements 
amortization of developed technologies is recorded as a cost of revenue  and amortization of other acquired intangibles is included in operating expenses 
year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages amortization of acquired intangible assets in cost of revenue in operating expenses total amortization expenses as a percentage of total revenue 
table of contents the increase in amortization expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a full year of amortization related to intangible assets acquired from staffware  and additional amortization related to intangible assets acquired from objectstar in second quarter of fiscal year the increase in amortization expense in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the amortization of acquired intangible assets from our acquisitions of staffware and general interface corp 
general interface in the second half of fiscal year we expect the amortization of acquired intangible assets to be approximately million for fiscal year  provided that there are no new acquisitions 
interest income year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages interest income as a percentage of total revenue the increase in interest income in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the effect of rising interest rates on our investments 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the decline in interest rates on our investments combined with a decrease in our investment asset base as a result of our repurchase and retirement of million of our common stock from reuters  as well as the net cash outlay of million for the staffware and general interface acquisitions 
interest expense year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages interest expense as a percentage of total revenue interest expense is related to the mortgage note payable for the purchase of our corporate headquarters in june we recorded a million mortgage note payable to a financial institution collateralized by the commercial real property acquired 
the balance of the mortgage note payable as of november  was million 
the mortgage note payable carries a fixed annual interest rate of and a year amortization 
the principal balance that will be remaining at the end of the year term of million will be due as a final balloon payment on july  interest expense declined slightly for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to principal amortization 
interest expense increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the fact that the mortgage note was entered into in june  so interest expense was incurred only for part of fiscal year  as compared to the entire year for fiscal year 
table of contents other income expenses  net other income expenses  net  includes realized gains and losses on investments  foreign exchange gain loss and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages other income expenses foreign exchange gain loss realized gain loss on short term investments realized gain loss on long term investments other income expense  net total other income expenses  net as a percentage of total revenue foreign exchange loss in fiscal year and was primarily attributable to the volatility of the us dollar against the euro and the british pound 
realized gain loss on short term investments represents gains or losses realized when such short term investments are sold and when other than temporary impairment on individual securities is recorded 
the difference between the realized gain in fiscal year compared to the realized loss in fiscal year was primarily due to a rising interest rate environment in compared to income taxes year ended november  change year to year to in thousands  except percentages provision for benefit from income tax effective tax rate our effective tax rate was  and for the fiscal years ended november   and  respectively 
for fiscal year  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the tax benefit from the partial release of the valuation allowance 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
the available positive evidence at november  included three years of historical operating profits and a projection of future income limited to three years which coincides with the period over which we recorded historical operating 
table of contents profits  due to our lack of visibility into earnings further into the future 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  we recorded a partial release of valuation allowance in fiscal year we continue to closely monitor available evidence and may adjust our valuation allowance in future periods 
as of november   we believed that the amount of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the partial release of valuation allowance would ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
if we have to re establish the full valuation allowance  it may result in a charge of million to the tax provision 
of the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million at november   we estimate that when released  approximately million will result in an income tax benefit  approximately million will be credited to goodwill and approximately million relating to stock option exercises and related tax credits will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
our income taxes payable for federal purposes have been reduced by the tax benefits associated with the exercise of employee stock options during the year and utilization of net operating loss carryover applicable to both stock options and acquired entities 
the benefits applicable to stock options were credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
of the million for fiscal year  million reduced taxes payable in the current year and therefore is shown as an increase to cash flow from operating activities on the statement of cash flows 
the remaining balance of million represents the partial release of valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that resulted from stock option benefits and  accordingly  was credited directly to stockholders equity 
the benefits applicable to acquired entities were credited directly to goodwill and amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
as of november   our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million  respectively  which expire through as of november   our federal and state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million  respectively  which expire through in the event of a change in ownership  as defined under federal and state tax laws  our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources current cash flows as of november   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million  representing an increase of million from november  our total cash and cash equivalent balance was million as of november  our short term available for sales investments totaled million  primarily in high grade corporate bonds and us government debt securities 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million  resulting from net income of million  adjusted for non cash charges including million of depreciation and amortization and million tax benefits from acquisitions and employee stock options  less million for deferred income tax valuation allowance release  and adjusted for net change in assets and liabilities net of acquisitions  including a million increase in deferred revenue mainly related to increased maintenance revenue  a million decrease in accrued restructuring and excess facilities mainly due to payments during the year  and million net cash used for other assets and liabilities 
to the extent that non cash items increase or decrease our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
after excluding the effects of these non cash charges  the primary changes in cash flows relating to operating activities result from changes in working capital 
our primary source of operating cash flows is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers  including maintenance which 
table of contents is typically billed annually in advance 
our operating cash flows are also impacted by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we generally pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the terms of accounts payable arrangements and the timing of our cash inflows 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal year  resulting primarily from the use of million for the acquisition of the assets of objectstar  million for the acquisition of the assets of velosel also see note business combinations  and million for capital expenditures  partially offset by net sales of short term investments of million 
net cash used for financing activities was million in fiscal year  primarily from our million repurchase of shares of common stock on the open market  less million cash received from the exercise of stock options and the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase program 
in december  our board of directors approved an additional eighteen month stock repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
the timing and amount of any repurchases under the plan will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations 
starting in fiscal year  in accordance with sfas r  a part of the tax benefit related to share based payments will be classified as cash flows from financing activities  instead of cash flows from operating activities 
as a result  our cash flows from operating activities are expected to decrease  offset by an increase in cash flows from financing activities 
we anticipate our operating expenses will grow in absolute dollars and in line with total revenue for the foreseeable future  and we intend to fund our operating expenses through cash flows from operations 
our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to million for fiscal year we expect to use primarily our current cash resources to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses  technologies or product lines  and repurchases of our common stock 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments together with expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  and currently approved stock repurchases for at least the next twelve months 
commitments in june  we purchased our corporate headquarters with a million mortgage note to lower our operating costs 
under the terms of the note  a balloon payment of million  representing the remaining principal balance  will be due on july   the end of the year term 
under the currently applicable terms of the mortgage note agreements  we are prohibited from acquiring another company without prior consent from the lender unless we maintain at least million of cash and cash equivalents  and meet other non financial terms as defined in the agreements 
in addition  we are subject to certain non financial covenants as defined in the agreements 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of november  in conjunction with the purchase of our corporate headquarters  we entered into a year land lease of the property 
the lease was paid in advance for a total of million  but is subject to adjustment every ten years based upon fluctuations in fair market value of the land 
we have the option to prepay any rent increase resulting from fluctuations in fair market value of the land 
we have a million revolving line of credit that matures on june  the revolving line of credit is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to million 
as of november   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility and a million irrevocable letter of credit was outstanding  leaving million of available credit for additional letters of credit or cash loans 
the million irrevocable letter of credit outstanding was issued in connection with the mortgage note payable 
the letter of credit automatically renews for successive one year periods  until the mortgage note payable has been satisfied in full 
we are required to maintain a minimum of million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  
table of contents and short term investments net of total current and long term indebtedness as well as comply with other non financial covenants defined in the agreement 
during fiscal  we were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving line of credit 
as of november   we had million in restricted cash in connection with bank guarantees issued by some of our international subsidiaries 
the cash collateral is presented as restricted cash and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of november  as of november   our contractual commitments associated with indebtedness  lease obligations and operational restructuring are as follows  in thousands total thereafter operating commitments debt principal debt interest operating leases total operating commitments restructuring related commitments gross lease obligations sublease income net lease obligations total commitments future minimum lease payments under restructured non cancelable operating leases as of november  include million provided for as accrued restructuring costs and million as accrued acquisition integration liabilities related to our acquisition of staffware 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements for further details on accrued restructuring costs 
indemnification our software license agreements typically provide for indemnification of customers for intellectual property infringement claims 
to date  no such claims have been filed against us 
we also warrant to customers that software products operate substantially in accordance with specifications 
historically  minimal costs have been incurred related to product warranties  and as such no accruals for warranty costs have been made 
in addition  we indemnify our officers and directors under the terms of indemnity agreements entered into with them  as well as pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  and applicable provisions of delaware law 
to date  we have not incurred any costs related to these indemnification arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of november   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp fas also includes 
table of contents accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp fas is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we are required to adopt fsp fas in the second quarter of fiscal we do not expect that the adoption of the statement will have a material impact on our consolidated results or financial condition 
in may  fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle  and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect that adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  fasb issued sfas r  share based payment revised  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 providing supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
in april  the sec issued amendment to rule a of regulation s x regarding the compliance date for statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment the amendment to rule a  changing the effective date for most public companies to adopt sfas r to the first interim reporting period of a company s fiscal year that begins on or after june  under the amendment to rule a  we are now required to adopt sfas r in our first quarter of fiscal year sfas r requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the pro forma disclosure previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an acceptable alternative to recognition of expense in the financial statements 
sfas r also provides three alternative transition methods for its first adoption 
up to the end of fiscal year  we had measured compensation costs related to share based payments under apb and as allowed by sfas  and provided pro forma disclosure in notes to our financial statements as required by sfas on adoption of sfas r  we will use the modified prospective application transition method 
sfas r also requires a classification change in the statement of cash flows  whereby a portion of the tax benefits from stock options will be moved from cash from operating activities to cash from financing activities  without changing the total cash flows 
we are still in the process of finalizing our study on the impact of applying various other provisions of sfas r 
we expect the adoption of sfas r  sab and related pronouncements  will have a materially adverse impact on our net income and net income per share 
however  we currently cannot accurately estimate the effect of such impact  as such costs will fluctuate as the fair market value of our common stock fluctuates 
in december  fasb issued sfas  exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment to apb opinion no 

this statement amends apb to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
at the end of fiscal years  and  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities totaling million  million and million  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds  respectively 
our investments consist primarily of bank and finance notes  various government obligations and asset backed securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in fair market value is determined to be other than temporary 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold 
the investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value in the event market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of november   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we develop products in the united states of america and sell in north america  south america  europe  the pacific rim and the middle east 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the acquisition of staffware increased our international sales and increased our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
a majority of sales are currently made in us dollars  however  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
to manage currency exposure related to net assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  we enter into forward contracts for certain foreign denominated assets or liabilities 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we had two outstanding forward contracts with total notional amounts of million as of november  we performed sensitivity analyses as of november  and november   measuring the change in fair value arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates vis vis the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
the analyses covered all of our foreign currency contracts offset by underlying exposures 
we used foreign currency exchange rates based on market rates in effect at november  and november   respectively 
the sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our foreign exchange derivative financial instruments  net of exposures  of million as of november  and million as of november
