overview we are engaged in the provision of dna testing services that generate genetic profile information by analyzing an organism s unique genetic identity 
we focus our business on dna testing for human identity as well as for animal and agricultural applications 
in the human identity area  we provide dna testing services for forensic  family relationship and security applications 
forensic dna testing is primarily used to establish or maintain databases of individuals convicted of crimes or  in some instances  arrested in connection with crimes  confirm that a suspect committed a particular crime or to exonerate an innocent person 
family relationship dna testing is used to establish whether two or more people are genetically related 
recently  dna testing has been used by individuals and employers in security applications by seeking to establish a person s genetic identity and store it for identification purposes in the event of an emergency or accident 
in the animal and agriculture field  we provide dna testing services for food safety and selective trait breeding 
our services are used extensively in each of these applications  and we expect their uses to increase as these markets continue to grow and new commercial applications evolve 
we have operations in the us and in the uk 
we market our services in many countries primarily in north america and europe  however  the majority of our current customers are based in the us and in the uk 
over the past few years  we have made significant progress in our transformation from a technology development organization to a dna laboratory testing company  with multiple service offerings in the us and the uk 
during  we hired key employees in finance  information technology and operations  who are in the process of analyzing our laboratory operations to identify ways of reducing costs as well as the amount of 
table of contents time that it takes to process a dna sample 
we believe low per unit costs and quick sample turn around times are important to gaining and maintaining a competitive advantage in our markets 
in april of  we announced the consolidation of our forensic casework business from our old facilities in germantown  maryland and dallas  texas  into a newly designed facility to be located in dallas 
the closure of our old dallas facility was completed in the fourth quarter of  and we moved into the new facility in dallas in november while we were in the consolidation process  our us forensic casework business experienced unexpected demand in the latter part of  which strained our us forensic processing capacity 
as a result  we began to hire additional dna analysts to increase our us forensic casework capacity 
we are in the process of analyzing our profitability by line of business and by contract 
we expect this analysis will help us to determine whether it is necessary to realign our strategic objectives by service line and increase capacity where needed in order to achieve profitability 
we believe a part of our future success in reducing costs  increasing turn around times and improving profitability is the successful utilization of a robust laboratory information management system  which will track transactions and improve our information gathering capabilities 
our revenues are predominately generated from services provided to our customers that relate to the completion of dna testing 
our costs and expenses consist of costs of service revenues  research and development expenses  marketing and sales expenses  general and administrative expenses and other income and expense 
costs of service revenues consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  fees paid for the collection of samples  and facility expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for development  laboratory supplies  and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits for salespeople within our company and all related costs of selling and marketing our products and services 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  and other corporate expenses

in addition  we experienced high growth in the volumes for our codis testing services  which have lower average gross margins than some of our other lines of business 
our operations in the uk provided all of our animal and agricultural testing services  in addition to a portion of our paternity and forensic dna testing services  and accounted for and of our total revenues for and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our uk revenues were derived through agreements with two contractors  defra and fal 
in june of  the defra contract was renewed for two more years  in may the contract was extended so that it is currently set to expire in december of we expect defra to put the contract out for bid in and we intend to bid for the ability to continue to perform scrapie testing for defra 
the contract with fal was executed in july of with an initial term of five years 
in  fal was acquired by lgc  a provider of analytical and diagnostic services  including dna testing services  and to that extent is in a position to compete for the business we currently conduct for fal 
as a result of this acquisition  we are implementing plans to enable us to directly provide our services to uk police forces  including the hiring of necessary personnel and the development of necessary infrastructure 
we continue to expect our uk operations to be a significant part of our business 
for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  our revenues were unfavorably impacted by as a result of the exchange rate movement of the british pound as compared to 
table of contents the us dollar 
excluding the unfavorable impact of the exchange rate movement  the growth rate in uk revenues for the year ended december  was 
the significant percentage of our revenue derived from our uk operations makes us vulnerable to future fluctuations in the exchange rate  and while there is currently no material adverse impact to our financial results  there can be no assurances that we will not experience adverse material exchange rate movements  which would have an unfavorable translation impact on our consolidated financial results

this is primarily due to a decline in our testing volumes related to our us forensic casework services  which was substantially offset by the increases in testing volumes for our us codis and uk forensic businesses 
the decline in our us forensic casework volumes was primarily due to lower than anticipated production capacity in our new dallas facility as a result of the transition of work from our germantown  maryland facility  which was closed in september  and lower than expected dna analyst staffing levels 
in addition  we continued to see delays in the timing of the release of bids by states and municipalities for outsourced forensic dna testing under fiscal year nij funding

such amounts represent obligations to pay future amounts over the next two years in conjunction with our acquisition of us patent no 
 and its foreign counterparts from affymetrix in july such amounts represent an unconditional guarantee related to the lease for the stamford  connecticut based laboratory  which was assigned in connection with the sale of the diagnostics business unit to tepnel 
we were required to sign this guarantee as a condition of the sale 
we reflected the fair value of the guarantee at the time of the sale of the diagnostics business of approximately million as a reduction to the net realizable value of these assets and liabilities 
we valued the guarantee based on the existing terms and conditions of the lease  an estimated vacancy of the space for one year prior to subleasing the space and expected rental income from the sublease of the space 
the lease terminates in april of minimum remaining rents under the assigned lease total approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the next twelve months 
we do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital in however  we may need to access the capital markets for additional financing to fund future growth opportunities or to operate our ongoing business activities after a period of time if our future results of operations fall below our expectations 
if so  we may not be able to raise additional funds or raise funds on terms that are acceptable to us 
if future financing is not available to us  or is not available on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
if we raise funds through equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution and our stock price may decline 
we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that we will not require substantial additional funding before we can achieve profitable operations 
we also may need additional capital if we seek to acquire other businesses or technologies 
as of december   our nol carryforwards were approximately million and approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
our federal and state nol carryforwards begin to expire in utilization of our nols to offset future taxable income  if any  may be substantially limited due to change of ownership provisions in the act 
the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of nol carryforwards and research and development credits following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act  which could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards and research and development credits 
we have determined that an ownership change  as defined by the act  occurred in approximately million of nol carryforwards is limited due to this ownership change 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take 
table of contents full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
the nol carryforwards subject to expiration through the year is approximately million 
we may have experienced other ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings and may experience others in connection with future financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned federal nol carryforwards may be further limited in the future 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill income taxes stock based compensation revenue recognition we recognize dna laboratory services revenues at the time test results are completed and reported 
deferred revenues represent the unearned portion of payments received in advance of tests being completed and reported 
unbilled receivables represent revenue which has been earned on completed and reported tests  but has not been billed to the customer 
revenues from license arrangements  including license fees creditable against future royalty obligations of the licensee  are recognized when an arrangement is entered into if we have no significant continuing involvement under the terms of the arrangement 
if we have significant continuing involvement under such an arrangement  license fees are deferred and recognized over the estimated performance period 
management has made estimates and assumptions relating to the performance period  which are subject to change 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the amount of revenues from licenses reported in any given period 
revenues from research and development agreements are recognized when related research expenses are incurred and when we have satisfied specific obligations under the terms of the respective agreements 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of amortizable identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decrease in the market value of the assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of amortizable intangibles and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
net amortizable intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million as of december  goodwill is subject to at least an annual recoverability assessment pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas 
table of contents accounting for income taxes 
we have generated net operating losses for tax purposes since inception 
as of december   these losses have resulted in nol carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
in addition  certain charges recorded in the current and prior years were not currently deductible for income tax purposes 
these differences result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities  will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of nol carryforwards  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets for which a valuation has been recorded  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then record income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately 
stock based compensation as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  we account for options granted to employees and directors utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on fixed stock option grants only if the current fair value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option at the date of grant  and it is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we account for stock options granted to non employees on a fair value basis in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
as a result  the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the fair value of our common stock 
as required under sfas  as amended  we also provide pro forma net loss allocable to common stockholders and pro forma net loss allocable to common stockholders per common share disclosures for employee and director stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas had been applied see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  to be effective for the first annual period beginning after june   thereby becoming effective for us in the first quarter of sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as an operating expense in the statement of operations 
the cost is recognized over the requisite service period based on fair values measured on the grant date 
the new standard may be adopted using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
the basic difference between the two methods is that the modified prospective transition method does not require restatement of prior periods  whereas the modified retrospective transition method will require restatement 
we will use the modified prospective method of adoption 
our adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a material impact on our results of operations 
the disclosure in note to our consolidated financial statements of the pro forma net loss allocable to common stockholders and pro forma net loss allocable to common stockholders per common share as if we had recognized 
table of contents compensation cost for share based payments under sfas for periods prior to fiscal is not necessarily indicative of the potential impact of recognizing compensation cost for share based payments under sfas r in future periods 
we estimate that the earnings per share impact to fiscal resulting from recording compensation expense related to our stock incentive plans  assuming no new share based payments are issued during the period  will be approximately to 
the potential impact of adopting sfas r on the results of operations and earnings per share for the fiscal year ending december  is dependent on several factors  including the number of options granted in the period  the fair value of those options which will be determined at the date of grant  the estimated forfeiture rate utilized  the related income tax benefits recorded  if any  and the diluted shares outstanding 
this estimate is based on certain assumptions as to these factors and the actual impact may differ if actual results vary from the assumptions 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition through a cumulative adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  sfas does not change the specific transition provisions of any existing or future accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which clarifies the accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is an unconditional legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
under fin  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
any uncertainty about the amount and or timing of future settlement should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value 
we adopted fin during the fourth quarter of and the adoption of fin had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  or sfas  which eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph b of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance 
sfas specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
we adopted sfas on july  and the adoption of sfas had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents and short term investments  which are conservative in nature  with a focus on preservation of capital 
due to the short term nature of our investments and the investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not material to our business 
as of december   we have no long term debt obligations 
foreign currency risk our business derives a substantial portion of its sales from international operations 
we record the majority of our foreign operational transactions  including all cash inflows and outflows  in the local currency  british pound sterling 
we also record all of our us operational transactions  including cash inflows and outflows  in the local currency  the us dollar 
we expect that international sales may continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our financial results  although to date the impact has not been material 
the significant percentage of our revenue derived from our uk operations makes us vulnerable to future fluctuations in the exchange rate  and there can be no assurance that the recent favorable to neutral trend in this exchange rate will not reverse  which would have an unfavorable translation impact on our consolidated financial results 
we are prepared to hedge against any fluctuations in foreign currencies should such fluctuations have a material economic impact on us  although we have not engaged in hedging activities to date 
accordingly  we believe that we have a reduced risk to foreign currency exchange risk 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the british pound sterling to us dollar currency exchange rate and currently estimate that such a change would have impacted earnings before income taxes for the year ended december  by approximately million
