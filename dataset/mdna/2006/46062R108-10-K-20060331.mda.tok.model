item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
all fleet statistics including the size of the fleet  utilization of the leasing equipment or the rental rates per day that are set forth in this annual report on form k include only our equipment  including that portion of our equipment managed by cai 
to the extent that our equipment is managed by cai  the equipment is considered fully utilized since it is not available for us to put on hire regardless of whether all of the units are generating equipment leasing revenue 
all equipment owned by cai or managed by cai with the exception of equipment owned by us and managed by cai is excluded from all statistics  unless otherwise indicated 
in addition  all of our chassis assigned to chassis pools are considered fully utilized 
this exclusion of information relative to cai  unless indicated otherwise  provides a focus on the drivers which are critical to our core business

during the third quarter of  we determined that we had not recorded the full amount of compensation expense required by us generally accepted accounting principles gaap with respect to a separation agreement entered into with our former president in october as a result  we concluded that it was necessary to restate our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and in connection with our decision to correct our consolidated financial statements for the additional compensation expense  we also corrected our and consolidated financial statements for an accounting error previously disclosed in our form k relating to hedge accounting that affected our financial results that had not been considered sufficiently material to require a modification of the consolidated financial statements 
our restated consolidated financial statements for and were included in the form k a we filed with the securities and exchange commission on november  for further information regarding this restatement  see note b in our form k a 
certain reclassifications have been made to the and amounts in order to conform to the presentation 
march sale of containers on march   our wholly owned container leasing subsidiary  interpool containers limited icl  completed the sale of approximately  standard dry marine cargo containers  together with an assignment of all rights of icl under existing leases for these containers with our customers  to a newly formed subsidiary of an investor group based in switzerland the purchaser  pursuant to a sale agreement dated march  the sale agreement 
although the sale was completed on march   the sale agreement stipulates that the purchaser will be entitled to the net operating income attributable to the containers sold to the purchaser from and after april  the aggregate cash purchase price paid by the purchaser was approximately million 
the containers sold represent approximately of the standard dry marine cargo containers owned by us at december  that were in our operating lease fleet  including most of the containers managed for us by our subsidiary cai 
the sale did not include containers subject to existing direct financing leases with customers 
in connection with the sale agreement  both we and cai entered into management agreements with the purchaser the management agreements under which cai agreed to perform management services on behalf of the purchaser with respect to the containers sold  including billing  collecting  lease renewal  operations and disposition activities  in consideration of a management fee equal to of the net operating income attributable to containers under long term operating leases  and of the net operating income attributable to containers under short term operating leases 
the management agreements designate icl to serve as sub manager of the containers currently under long term lease for such period of time as we may elect  up to the respective dates when the containers are returned by their current lessees 
during that period  icl will be entitled to receive the management fees described above 
the duration of the management agreements will be ten years from the closing date  subject to extension for up to two additional years at the purchaser s option 
our existing agreements with cai are being modified to reflect these new arrangements 
we intend to continue to make container acquisitions in the future and will continue to be engaged in the business of leasing containers and related equipment to our customers under both operating and direct financing leases 
neither the sale agreement nor the management agreements restricts us from engaging in any business in the future or from acquiring containers for lease to customers 
the sale agreement does not contain any provision that would require us to repurchase the containers from the purchaser based upon the occurrence of future events 
we will use the proceeds from the sale of the containers to reduce indebtedness  for equipment acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
as a result of the consummation of these transactions  we expect to report a gain on the sale of the containers to the purchaser during the quarter ending march  the after tax amount of this gain is expected to be approximately million  subject to closing adjustments and final accounting review 
effective april   we will no longer record leasing revenue relating to the containers sold to the purchaser  but we or cai will instead record management fee revenue relating to the sold containers under the management agreements 
first quarter impairment charge beginning in late and continuing into the first quarter of  one of our larger shipping line customers began returning a significant number of containers under leases entered into during and that had expired 
based upon an analysis of the quantity of containers involved  then existing conditions in the short term leasing market and related expenses associated with major equipment returns  we entered into negotiations with this customer regarding the parties on going and future business relationships 
following extensive discussions  we reached an agreement with the customer whereby the leases for these containers would be converted to direct financing leases by extending the lease terms  with the lessee obtaining ownership at expiration 
as a result of this modification to the lease terms  we concluded on march  that it would be necessary under us generally accepted accounting principles to record a charge for impairment for these assets 
the amount of this impairment charge  which will be recorded in the first quarter of  is expected to be approximately million 
no portion of this impairment charge will result in any cash expenditures by us 
to the extent that this agreement is extended to cover additional containers  by mutual agreement of the parties  we may incur an additional impairment charge in the future 
general interpool is one of the world s leading suppliers of equipment and services to the intermodal transportation industry 
we believe we are the world s largest lessor of intermodal container chassis and a leading lessor of international dry freight standard containers used in international trade 
our primary sources of equipment leasing revenue are derived from operating leases and income earned on direct financing leases 
we generate this revenue through leasing transportation equipment  primarily intermodal container chassis and intermodal dry freight standard containers 
operating lease equipment operating leases and direct financing leases are the two major asset types that generate this revenue 
in the case of operating lease equipment  we retain the substantive risks and rewards of equipment ownership 
in the case of direct financing leases  the lessee generally has the substantive risks and rewards of equipment ownership and the right to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
this equipment leasing revenue is supplemented by other sources of revenue such as fees charged to the lessee for handling  delivery and repairs earned under contractual agreement with the lease customer 
equipment leasing revenue derived from an operating lease generally consists of the monthly lease payments from the customer 
for direct financing leases  the lessee s payment is segregated into principal and interest components much like a loan 
the interest component  calculated using the effective interest method over the term of the lease  is recognized by us as equipment leasing revenue 
the principal component of the direct financing lease payment is reflected as a reduction to the net investment in the direct financing lease 
other revenues consist primarily of fees charged to the lessee for handling of our equipment  and repairs for which the customer is responsible under the terms of their lease agreement 
our mix of operating and direct financing leases is a function of customer preference and demand and our success in meeting those customer requirements 
an operating lease  during its initial lease term  will generally be more profitable than a direct financing lease  primarily due to the return of principal inherent in a direct financing lease  which is usually greater than the depreciation expense associated with an operating lease 
however  after the initial term and any renewal of an operating lease expires  the operating lease will have redeployment costs and related risks that are avoided under a direct financing lease 
in evaluating the revenue performance of our operating lease portfolio  the primary factors considered are utilization and daily rental rates 
chassis have been leased in pooled arrangements at marine ports since the mid s 
chassis pools are locations where a lessor provides a group of chassis in a single port terminal location to be rented on a daily basis 
a customer who signs our pool agreement and has appropriate credit is allowed to rent any chassis in the pool at any time 
the industry term for this type of chassis pool is called a neutral pool  because the chassis are provided by a neutral third party rather than the shipping lines themselves 
a shipping line notifies a trucker to pick up a chassis from the pool and then proceed to pick up the designated container for movement 
the chassis is returned by the trucker to the pool when the move is complete 
the shipping line or other customer pays only for the number of days it uses the chassis 
pool rental rates are higher than term lease rates because the customer pays only when the chassis is in use and we may experience some idle  unpaid period between uses of the chassis and because the customer generally does not pay for any maintenance and repair the costs being also bundled into the overall chassis pool rate 
recently  we have established two more advanced neutral chassis pools 
these pools are clusters of locations in a region 
we call them metro pools and such pools have been established in the new york metropolitan area  and the houston metropolitan area 
these pools differ from traditional neutral pools in that customers are able to pick up chassis in one location and return them to other locations that are all in the network 
the logistics of the networking process are managed by our proprietary poolstat software  which also manages the inventory and billing functions of the pools 
this form of neutral pool is growing  and should see continued rapid growth in the next several years 
in  we acquired the north american intermodal division of transamerica leasing  inc which included chassis pool operations at railroad terminals 
this program has continued to expand  and today we have neutral chassis pools at over rail terminals across the united states 
some of these terminals are linking up with the metro pools to create a more integrated marine rail pool network 
in addition to neutral chassis pools involving the rental of trac lease chassis  trac lease also provides management services to the shipping lines who want to pool only their chassis in a port terminal for increased efficiency 
the industry terms for these pools are cooperative or co op chassis pools 
the participating shipping lines contribute the chassis under their control to the overall pool 
once in the pool  any contributor can use any other contributor s chassis 
trac lease s poolstat software performs a number of complex management functions  including keeping track of the number of chassis used per day by a contributor versus the number of chassis contributed 
cooperative pools like neutral pools are growing in popularity with our customer base 
during the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   our equipment leasing revenues for chassis increased due to an increase in the size of our operating lease chassis fleet and an increase in the size and performance of our chassis pool fleet  partially offset by a decline in utilization including equipment on both operating and direct financing leases from to 
during  the size of our chassis fleet increased to  chassis from  chassis at december during the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   the decline in equipment leasing revenues for containers was primarily due to the contractual runoff of the container direct financing lease portfolio as well as a reduction in utilization rates 
this reduction in utilization resulted from both the acquisition of new containers which have not yet been placed on lease and other containers being returned at the end of their lease term 
our fleet of containers increased to  twenty foot equivalent units teu at december  from  teu at december  utilization of our container fleet including equipment on both operating and direct financing leases was and at december  and  respectively 
since the second quarter of  an excess supply of new containers has developed in china 
while we believe this situation is probably temporary due to the significant deliveries of container ships scheduled for the next several years and the normal retirement of older containers  it has resulted in a slowing of new production  a reduction in new container prices and  in turn  has also resulted in softness in leasing demand and daily rental rates for long term leases of new equipment 
in addition  daily rental rates for used containers are very competitive and expiring operating leases are often renewed at daily rates that are lower than the rental rates during the initial lease term 
during the second quarter of  the number of new containers we had available for long term lease increased  as customer demand for new on hires was below demand expectations 
however  a significant portion was subsequently placed on lease during the second half of and we expect to place the remainder of this equipment on long term lease during the first half of in general  demand for leasing of new containers in the second half of has been slower than the first half of lease rates for new chassis rose steadily during the first half of due to both the increased cost of new equipment and the overall limitations in production space 
similarly  lease rates for used chassis rose from mid through the first half of  largely due to the depletion of used chassis inventories and the rising price of new and remanufactured chassis 
demand for new chassis remained strong in the third and fourth quarters of and lease rates have remained at the levels experienced in the first half of we expect rates to remain at current levels through the first half of we anticipate that industry demand for chassis will remain generally strong through in part this is due to the increased volume of cargo movement in and out of railroad terminals  causing the railroads to reconfigure the patterns of container and chassis activity on the terminals 
in a growing number of locations  they are requiring empty containers to be moved off of the terminal  a process that requires additional chassis to service the additional container movements 
railroads are also increasing the use of neutral chassis pooling operated by leasing companies to aid efficiency 
marine ports are experiencing similar congestion  and are beginning to take similar measures to ease this congestion 
overall  more chassis will be needed to service these anti congestion efforts 
periods of fluctuation in leasing demand can occur 
during the second half of  we noted decreases in leasing demand for containers and in daily rental rates for long term container leases 
we anticipate that industry demand for chassis and containers will continue to grow 
this expectation is supported by continued anticipation of a major expansion of the world cellular container ship fleet through as evidenced by recent reports that the major shipyards are experiencing large order backlogs through as reported in the containerisation international yearbook  the world container fleet excluding vessels to be scrapped is expected to increase by in and in and beyond 
as of november   the total container ship order book was comprised of approximately  ships with a total capacity of approximately million teu  for an increase of approximately of the world cellular container ship capacity 
we are not able to predict when this anticipated growth will impact container leasing demand 
we believe a number of factors have contributed to the high utilization of equipment in the industry 
from to  according to the containerisation international yearbook  global containerized traffic increased by  from million teu in to million teu in  increasing demand for transportation equipment generally 
in addition  several major shipping lines started to bring new  very large  teu ships to the west coast of the united states in the fall of when ships of this size are unloaded  they require the use of a larger number of chassis to move the containers to local railroad terminals or their final destinations 
the large quantity of vessels on order will also require additional containers to support them 
demand for chassis has also been affected by the inability of the larger  fully loaded ships to pass through the panama canal 
these ships typically discharge their cargo on the west coast of the united states  with the cargo being moved by land bridges  by truck and rail  inland and across the country  using chassis at various stages during this process 
at the same time  the demand for chassis  along with increased congestion at many of the rail and marine facilities around the country  has fueled an increase in the pooling of chassis for greater efficiencies 
correspondingly  we have experienced an increase in demand for our poolstat based chassis management services as more shipping lines are entering into these chassis sharing arrangements 
in addition  we have continued to experience high demand in our own trac lease neutral chassis pools at railroads and marine terminals 
as a result of these factors  pool revenues increased significantly during and will continue to do so in in late august  hurricane katrina caused damage to some of our equipment when it struck two facilities in new orleans where about of our containers and of our chassis were located 
under the terms and conditions of our agreements with the facilities and the lessees in possession of our equipment at the time  it is their responsibility to repair the damage at their expense 
to date  most equipment has been repaired under these terms and at no cost to the company 
during  we received net additional financing commitments of million from several institutions 
at december  excluding million available under cai s revolving credit facility  we had a total of million of unused commitments for growth  to re finance existing secured debt or for other working capital requirements 
our interest expense was million higher during than it was during as we experienced a higher level of interest rates  partially offset by the fact that waiver related bank fees paid during were significantly lower than they had been during  at which time we were required to obtain waivers related to our delayed sec filings 
the increase in interest rates was due to an overall increase in interest rates for new borrowings  including the issuance during late of the million of notes due in which have an overall interest rate of  including the amortization of the original issue discount 
we regularly evaluate financing proposals which  when coupled with available cash balances and funds available under commitments mentioned above  could be used for growth  for refinancing existing facilities and for working capital 
as of december   our commitments for future capital expenditures totaled approximately million with approximately million committed for our available liquidity at december   including million available under credit facilities which excludes cai s credit facility  was million after deducting million of restricted cash 
required debt repayments and capital lease payments for the next months totaled million 
based on our existing cash balances  financings closed  and our financial projections of operating cash flow for the future  we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to grow our portfolio while meeting our obligations and commitments as they become due 
other than interest expense and depreciation expense on our operating lease equipment  our primary expenses are corporate administrative and lease operating expenses  which include maintenance and repair expense  as well as storage and positioning expense 
our lessees are generally responsible for lease operating expenses during the term of their lease 
our corporate administrative expenses are primarily employee related costs such as salary expense  costs of employee benefits  information technology expenses and travel and entertainment costs  as well as expenses incurred for outside services such as legal  consulting and audit related fees 
during  lease operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  compared to during the same period in this increase was primarily due to an increase in maintenance and repair costs  positioning and handling expenses  and compensation expense for the variable accounting associated with the change in the fair value for the portion of cai s preferred stock held by certain employees of cai which was acquired using the proceeds of the loan from cai 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in storage and equipment rental costs 
the additional personnel and systems enhancements we are adding to improve our internal controls  as well as additional procedures being implemented to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  have also added incremental administrative expenses in non performing receivables totaled million at december  compared with million at december  reserves of million and million  respectively  have been established against these non performing receivables 
during  receivable write offs net of recoveries totaled million as compared with million in our net income for the year ended december  was million as compared with million for the year ended december  the december  net income included non cash income of million for which no tax expense is recorded resulting from the change in fair value of the warrants issued by us during september in connection with a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold million of notes due in in addition  the december  net income included million net of tax resulting from the gain on sale of an equity investment and million net of tax of expenses related to repatriation 
the december  net income included income of million net of tax related to an insurance settlement 
additionally  the december  net income included non cash expense of million for which no tax benefit is derived resulting from the change in fair value of the warrants mentioned above 
our net income per share on a fully diluted basis for the year ended december  and was and  respectively 
annualized return on average stockholders equity was for the year ended december  excluding the non cash income for the change in the fair value of the warrants  the gain on sale of equity investment and the repatriation expenses  the annualized return on average stockholder s equity was for the year ended december  excluding the non cash expense for the change in the fair value of the warrants and the gain on settled insurance litigation  the annualized return on average stockholders equity was for the year ended december  we conduct business with shipping line customers throughout the world and are therefore subject to the risks of operating in disparate political and economic conditions including those associated with increasing oil prices 
offsetting this risk is the worldwide nature of the shipping business and the ability of our shipping line customers to shift their operations from areas of unfavorable political and or economic conditions to more promising areas 
approximately of our revenues are billed and paid in us dollars 
we believe these factors substantially mitigate foreign currency rate risks 
on december   interpool  inc s wholly owned barbados subsidiary  interpool limited  made a distribution to interpool  inc of approximately million the distribution  as part of a plan approved by interpool  inc s board of directors to repatriate accumulated and current earnings and profits of interpool limited  which previously had been considered permanently reinvested outside the united states 
pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the ajca  the distribution was subject to us federal tax at a reduced rate of approximately 
in connection with our repatriation plan  on december   effective as of close of business on november   interpool limited  which operated our international container leasing business  transferred substantially all of its operating assets and related liabilities to interpool containers limited icl  a newly formed barbados company which is a subsidiary of interpool  inc icl now operates our international container leasing business 
our container leasing operations are primarily conducted through our barbados subsidiaries  previously interpool limited  and beginning november   icl  as well as through our consolidated subsidiary cai  of which we own a common equity interest and currently appoint a majority of the members of the board of directors 
our effective us federal tax rate benefits substantially from the application of an income tax convention  pursuant to which the profits of interpool limited and beginning november   icl from international container leasing operations are exempt from federal taxation in the united states 
these profits are subject to barbados tax at rates that are significantly lower than the applicable rates in the united states 
for further information regarding the united states and barbados tax treaty  see note to the consolidated financial statements and the united states federal income tax section of management s discussion and analysis in this form k 
through december   we claimed treaty benefits under the united states and barbados income tax treaty the tax treaty 
the tax treaty contained a limitation on the benefits provision which denied treaty benefits under certain circumstances 
however  we did not fall within the tax treaty s limitation on benefits provision 
beginning january   in addition to having to satisfy the limitation on benefits provision  interpool limited and icl are only eligible for the tax treaty benefits with respect to its container rental and sales income if interpool inc is listed on a recognized stock exchange and interpool inc s stock is primarily and regularly traded on such exchange 
although our common stock was not listed on a recognized stock exchange at january   on january   our common stock was listed  and began trading  on the new york stock exchange 
we believe this listing and our current trading volume satisfies the primarily and regularly traded requirements of the tax treaty  thus qualifying us for benefits under the tax treaty again on january  we estimated there should be no us current tax expense for the period january  to january   when we were not covered by the tax treaty 
as companies resident of barbados  interpool limited and icl are required to file tax returns in barbados and pay any tax liability to barbados 
prior to the third quarter of  no barbados tax returns had been prepared and filed for interpool limited for any period subsequent to its tax year 
as of september   all previously outstanding barbados tax returns tax years were filed 
there was no underpayment of taxes  interest or penalties other than a nominal late filing penalty with the filing of these returns 
results of operations the sections that follow analyze our results of operations by financial statement caption and provide a more detailed discussion of our performance for the year ended december  as compared to december  and for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  equipment leasing revenue 
our equipment leasing revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
container leasing segment revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in container operating lease revenues of million and a reduction in direct financing lease revenues of million 
the decrease in container operating lease revenues was primarily due to a decrease in utilization rates  partially offset by an increase in the daily rental rates 
utilization rates of our container fleet have historically been calculated assuming containers managed by cai were utilized since they were not available to us to put on hire regardless of whether all of these units are generating revenue 
under this method  utilization rates of our container operating lease fleet were and at december  and  respectively 
this reduction in utilization resulted from both the acquisition of new containers which have not yet been placed on lease and other containers being returned at the end of their lease term 
the utilization rates of our operating lease container fleet  considering cai s actual utilization rates for our operating lease containers managed by cai  were and at december  and  respectively 
domestic intermodal equipment segment revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in chassis operating lease revenues of million  partially offset by a decrease in direct financing lease revenues of million 
the incremental chassis operating lease revenues were primarily due to an increase in our chassis operating lease fleet of and an increase in the size and the performance of our chassis pool fleet which generally earns a higher daily rental rate  partially offset by a decrease in utilization rates 
the decrease in direct financing lease revenues  as compared to the prior year period  was primarily due to the run off of the finance lease portfolio at a rate which was faster than the addition of new leases to this portfolio 
the utilization rates of our domestic intermodal chassis operating lease fleet were and at december  and  respectively 
other revenue 
our other revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
container leasing segment other revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in billable repairs to our lessees at the termination of a lease of million and an increase in container positioning revenue of million 
domestic intermodal equipment segment other revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in billable repairs to our lessees at the termination of a lease of million and an increase in chassis positioning revenue of million 
lease operating and administrative expenses 
our lease operating and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in maintenance and repair costs of million primarily due to an increase in chassis assigned to chassis pools which generate higher daily rental rates and higher repair expenses 
in addition  we experienced an increase in the number of chassis that were refurbished or remanufactured during the current period which resulted in an increase to maintenance and repairs costs 
an increase in salary and employee related expenses of million primarily due to million of compensation expense for the variable accounting associated with the change in the fair value for the portion of cai s preferred stock held by certain employees of cai which was acquired using the proceeds of the loan from cai and an increase in headcount and employee related costs  partially offset by a reduction in compensation related expenses associated with the variable accounting for our stock appreciation rights 
the reduction in compensation related expense relative to our stock appreciation rights was primarily due to the decline in the market value of our common stock during the current year period as compared to the prior year period 
an increase in positioning and handling expense for our equipment of million which was primarily due to the repositioning of equipment to chassis pool locations and to customers at the outset of new term leases 
an increase in consulting fees of million primarily due to increased consulting services to facilitate compliance with the sarbanes oxley act during the first four months of and the development of our new it systems  partially offset by a reduction in consulting services associated with our financial planning and analysis activities as we added personnel to bring those activities in house 
an increase of million due to the effects of foreign currency translation 
a decrease in equipment rental costs of million primarily due to the buyout of leases related to container equipment which had previously been leased in by cai 
a decrease in storage costs of million primarily due to increased utilization experienced within cai s container fleet as well as our containers managed by cai 
a decrease in audit expenses of million resulting from incremental audit fees incurred for the year ended december  due to the delay in filing our financial statements for and and additional costs incurred in related to the implementation requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
a decrease in legal fees of million primarily due to reduced legal costs incurred in connection with the audit committee and sec investigations 
a further breakdown of the lease operating and administrative expense variances  as compared to the prior period  by reportable segment is as follows container leasing segment lease operating and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease can be summarized as follows dollars in millions container leasing equipment rental expense storage expense positioning and handling expense maintenance and repairs expense audit expense legal fees salary and employee related expenses foreign exchange consulting fees other  net total domestic intermodal equipment segment lease operating and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase can be summarized as follows dollars in millions domestic equipment intermodal maintenance and repairs expense positioning and handling expense consulting fees salary and employee related expenses foreign exchange legal fees audit expense equipment rental expense storage expense other  net total during  we incurred costs totaling million million  net of tax related to the investigations by our audit committee and the sec  separation agreements with our former chief financial officer and our former president  legal representation for the company as well as our officers  directors and employees  the payment of fees in order to obtain necessary waivers from our financial institutions and the proceedings before the new york stock exchange to delist our securities 
the largest components of these costs incurred in were million of legal and consulting fees and million of bank waiver fees 
it is possible that we could continue to incur additional costs relating to the formal investigation by the sec and the class action lawsuit  including the cost of legal representation for the company and our current and former officers  directors and employees 
provision for doubtful accounts 
our provision for doubtful accounts increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to additional provisions for specific customers which became delinquent during during the year ended december   our non performing receivables decreased million million at december  and million at december  
as of december  and december   our non performing receivables  net of applicable reserves  were and  respectively  of accounts receivable  net 
our provision for doubtful accounts is provided based upon a quarterly review of the receivables 
this review is based on the risk profile of the receivables  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and economic conditions  as well as the value of underlying collateral in the case of direct financing lease receivables 
fair value adjustment for derivative instruments 
our fair value adjustment for derivative instruments income amounted to million for the year ended december  as compared to income of million for the year ended december  the income for the year ended december   as well as the prior year period  was primarily due to the change in fair value of interest rate swap agreements held which do not qualify as cash flow hedges 
fair value adjustment for warrants 
our non cash fair value adjustment for warrants income amounted to income of million for the year ended december   as compared to expense of million for the prior year period 
the income for the year ended december   as well as the expense for the prior year period  were due to the change in the estimated fair value of the warrants issued in september in connection with the notes 
the warrants are classified as a liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the estimated fair market value of these warrants decreased from million at december  to million at december  this reduction in the fair value of the warrants resulted primarily from the change in the market value of our common stock during a registration statement for the warrants was filed with the sec and was declared effective on february  it is management s belief that this was the final criteria to be met under the provisions of eitf for classification of the warrants as equity 
therefore  the volatility of our earnings resulting from the classification of these warrants as a liability will be limited to the change in the value of these warrants between december  and february  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization of leasing equipment 
our depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to additions to our chassis operating lease fleet  partially offset by reductions in depreciation within the container leasing segment 
for a majority of the current year period  the size of the container operating lease fleet was lower than the corresponding fleet in due to ongoing sales of used containers 
at december   the container fleet showed an increase over levels due to the acquisition of equipment during the late stages of the year 
impairment of leasing equipment 
our impairment of leasing equipment expense decreased to million for year ended december   from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in impairment losses related to damaged equipment that was subsequently remanufactured million  partially offset by an increase in impairment losses for idle equipment million 
income loss for investments accounted for under the equity method 
the decrease in income loss for investments accounted for under the equity method of million during the year ended december  resulted primarily from reduced earnings from the investment which was sold during the third quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the sale of our equity investment 
loss on retirement of debt 
during the year ended december   in connection with the repatriation of foreign earnings and profits and the repayment of certain debt instruments  we incurred million of fees as a result of the early extinguishment of debt which was paid off prior to its contractual maturity 
gain on sale of leasing equipment 
we had a gain on sale of leasing equipment of million during the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease of million was primarily due to a decrease of million in gains on equipment sales to third party investors recognized by cai 
the decrease in gains on equipment sales recognized by cai was primarily due to a decrease in volume of units sold to third party investors during the current year period as well as a decrease in the margin recognized by cai on sales to third parties 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in gains on equipment sales within our container and chassis product lines as compared to the prior year period 
other income  net

interest expense 
our interest expense increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased interest rates million and increased borrowings million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in waiver related bank fees of million 
this decrease was due to the bank fees paid throughout in order to obtain waivers from our lenders necessitated by our delayed sec filings 
as of december   we were no longer delinquent with regard to our sec filings  therefore we did not incur such fees during the increase in interest rates was due to an overall increase in interest rates for new borrowings  including the issuance during late of the million of notes due in which have an overall interest rate of  including the amortization of the original issue discount 
interest income 
our interest income increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in average invested cash balances due to the proceeds received during late under new debt agreements  higher interest rates on the invested cash balances  the partial liquidation of our investment in a private equity investment fund million and the receipt of million of past due interest received on a note receivable which was accounted for as non performing at december  due to the multiple extensions of the repayment terms by the borrower 
minority interest expense  net

provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  although pre tax income  as adjusted for the non cash fair market adjustment for warrants which have no tax effect  increased by only million  the million net increase in the income tax provision resulted primarily from three factors i the million federal and state tax incurred on the million repatriation distribution made by interpool limited to interpool  inc during december  ii the million increase in state taxes incurred by interpool limited in connection with its sale of substantially all of its operating assets and liabilities to interpool containers limited  and iii a higher proportion of pre tax income derived during  as compared to  from the domestic intermodal division  which is taxed at the higher united states rates  as opposed to the lower taxed approximately international container division 
these increases to the income tax provision were offset by a low effective tax rate applied against the pre tax gain realized on the sale of an equity investment  because for tax purposes the equity investment had never been written down  and million net reversals in valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets 
the million net reversals in the valuation allowances includes an million increase relating to an equity investment  chassis holdings i  llc  and complete valuation allowance reversals of million pertaining to certain equity investments which have been fully disposed of and to state net operating losses which were reclassified as state passive activity losses

container leasing segment revenues increased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in container operating lease revenues of million  partially offset by a decrease in direct financing lease revenues of million 
the incremental container operating lease revenues  as compared to the prior year period  are primarily due to our container operating lease fleet which increased in size by 
the daily rental rates for the overall container fleet were lower  partially offsetting the incremental revenue resulting from the increased average size of our container operating lease fleet 
utilization rates of our container fleet have historically been calculated assuming containers managed by cai were utilized since they were not available to us to put on hire regardless of whether all of these units are generating revenue 
under this method  utilization rates of our container operating lease fleet were at december  and the utilization rates of our operating lease container fleet  considering cai s actual utilization rates for our operating lease containers managed by cai  were and at december  and  respectively

a decrease of million in positioning and handling expenses  primarily due to a reduction in services incurred for the united states military 
a decrease in maintenance and repair costs of million primarily due to a decrease in repairs of equipment for both the chassis and container product lines 
a decrease in legal and consulting fees of million primarily due to a reduction in legal fees related to the audit committee and sec investigations in and the class action lawsuit  partially offset by increased consulting services

our provision for doubtful accounts decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to an improvement in the risk profile of our outstanding receivables  partially offset by the reversal during the prior year period of bad debt provisions previously recorded by microtech  without a similar reversal of bad debt provisions during the current year period million 
during the year ended december   our non performing receivables decreased million million at december  and million at december  
as of december  and december   our non performing receivables  net of applicable reserves  were and  respectively  of accounts receivable  net

fair value adjustment for warrants 
our non cash fair value adjustment for warrants expense amounted to million for the quarter and year ended december   without a similar item in the prior year period 
the expense for the year ended december  was due to the change in the fair value of the warrants issued during september in connection with the notes  which warrants are classified as a liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
due primarily to the increase in the market value of our common stock during the last quarter of  the fair market value of these warrants increased from million at september  to million at december  depreciation and amortization of leasing equipment 
our depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or

the increase of million was primarily due to an increase of million in gains on equipment sales to third parties recognized by cai 
the increase in gains on equipment sales recognized by cai was due to an increase in volume  as well as an increase in the returns generated on the equipment sales due to the favorable market conditions within the container resale sector 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we sold certain assets of ctc container trading uk limited  a wholly owned subsidiary which leased specialized cargo carrying units and other equipment for use by companies operating in the north sea  which resulted in a pre tax profit of approximately million 
the remainder of the increase in gains on equipment sales was primarily due to the favorable market conditions we experienced in the resale sector for containers as compared to the prior year period  as well as sales of certain railcars which contributed favorably to profits on equipment sales 
other income  net 
we had other income of million during the year ended december  compared to million of other income for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to a million gain recorded in october resulting from the consolidation of assets and liabilities of a special purpose entity which no longer qualified for off balance sheet treatment for accounting purposes formed as part of our container lease securitization program 
this gain resulted primarily from the favorable credit loss experience through september  on the underlying direct financing leases as compared to the assumed credit losses of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the accounting for this special purpose entity

minority interest expense  net 
the change in minority interest expense  net of million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a million increase in net income reported by our owned consolidated subsidiary  cai 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was principally caused by an increase in taxable income of million as adjusted for the million permanent tax difference that arose from the non cash expense pertaining to the warrant liability 
in addition  a larger proportion of taxable income was generated from united states sources as compared to lower taxed international source income 
interpool limited s pre tax income international sourced income is taxed at a low rate approximately due to the income tax convention between the united states and barbados 
the domestic intermodal division s pre tax income united states sourced income  including corporate activities and the results of operations of cai  is taxed at the higher united states tax rates 
during the year ended december   of taxable income was generated from united states sources as compared to a loss experienced during the year ended december   thus contributing to the increase in the provision for income taxes 
net income 
as a result of the factors described above  our net income decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have used funds from various sources to meet our corporate obligations and to finance the acquisition of equipment for lease to customers 
the primary funding sources have been cash provided by operations  borrowings generally from banks and securitization of lease receivables  issuance of capital lease obligations and the sale of our securities 
in addition  we have generated cash from the sale of equipment being retired from our fleet 
in general  we have sought to meet debt service requirements from the leasing revenue generated by our equipment 
at december   our scheduled capital lease and debt service payments principal and estimated interest for totaled million and for totaled million 
scheduled payments due to us under non cancelable operating and direct financing lease agreements with our lessees total million for and million for see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as of december   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash and marketable securities on hand 
the combination of unrestricted cash and marketable securities million and non cancelable lease payments due to us during and million exceeds our scheduled debt service payments principal and estimated interest of million for and by approximately million 
our utilization rates of containers and chassis  as well as those of our competitors are at high levels 
however  there has been softness in the container sector due to an excess supply of new containers in china resulting in decreased demand for containers and decreases in daily rental rates for long term container leases 
in addition  lease rates for used containers were competitive for much of the past two years 
we anticipate that industry demand for chassis and containers will continue to grow 
this expectation is supported by continued anticipation of a major expansion of the world cellular container ship fleet through as evidenced by recent reports that the major shipyards are experiencing large order backlogs through as of december   the existing order backlog was enough to account for an increase of approximately in the world s cellular container ship fleet and is expected to result in demand for a significant number of additional containers and chassis 
we are not able to predict when this anticipated growth will impact container leasing demand 
lease rates for new chassis rose steadily during the first half of due to both the increased cost of new equipment and the overall limitations in production space 
similarly  lease rates for used chassis rose from mid through the first half of  largely due to the depletion of used chassis inventories and the rising price of new and remanufactured chassis 
demand for new chassis remained strong in the second half of and lease rates have remained at the levels experienced in the first half of during the second half of  we noted decreases in leasing demand for containers and in daily rental rates for long term container leases 
in addition  lease rates for used containers were competitive for much of the past two years 
we are not currently able to predict whether this decrease in demand represents a trend that will continue in  although demand for leasing of new containers in the second half of has been slower than the first half of we have usually funded a significant portion of the purchase price for new containers and chassis through secured borrowings from financial institutions under various credit facilities 
however  from time to time we have funded new equipment acquisitions through the use of working capital and may finance this equipment at a later date 
we have successfully added million of net financing commitments for secured financing from january  to december  as of december  excluding million available under cai s revolving credit facility  a total of million of these financing commitments was available to us for future use 
we are currently in negotiations with other potential lenders with regard to additional financings to support business growth

the interest rate for the b notes is libor plus basis points for the first twelve months the loan is outstanding and libor plus basis points thereafter 
the fortis facility requires that by april we enter into interest rate swap contracts in order to effectively convert at least seventy five percent of the debt associated with operating lease equipment and ninety percent of the debt associated with direct financing lease s from floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as of december   we have no t entered into any of these interest rate swap contracts 
the fortis facilit y also includes covenants related to a minimum level of tangible net worth  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  and a maximum funded debt to tangible net worth ratio  as well as other customary restrictive covenants

the new credit facility has a total commitment amount of up to million and was provided by a group of banks 
the interest rate under the revolving line of credit varies depending upon whether the loans are characterized as base rate loans or eurodollar rate loans in addition  there is a commitment fee on the unused amount of the total commitment which fee is payable quarterly in arrears 
the new credit facility provides that swing line loans up to million in the aggregate and standby letters of credit up to million in the aggregate will be available to cai  which sublimits are part of  and not in addition to  the tota l commitment of million under the new credit facility 
the term of this revolving credit facility is three years 
in connection with the first loan advance under the new revolving credit facility  cai repaid the outstanding principal balance of million on its then existing revolving credit facility plus interest and additional fees and repaid million of the amounts owed to us under the outstanding subordinated note issued by cai to us in at december   million was outstanding under cai s revolving credit facility 
this revolving credit facility contains various financial and other covenants 
at december   cai was in compliance with these covenants 
as mentioned above  on april   cai repaid million of its million subordinated note held by us 
this repayment returned this subordinated note to the original payment schedule in effect before it was modified during the remaining balance of the subordinated note  totaling million as of december   is required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of approximately million through april  in addition  the financial covenants associated with this subordinated note were also amended in april notes and warrants on september   we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold million total principal amount of a new series of notes due the notes in a private transaction with four investors 
in connection with the sale of the notes  we also issued to the investors two series of warrants that were originally exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share th e warrants 
the exercise price of the warrants is subject to customary anti dilution adjustments as set forth in the warrants 
as of decembe r   as a result of anti dilution adjustments  the warrants were exercisable for a total of  shares at an exercise price of per share 
based on adjustments through january  the record date for the most recent dividend declared by the company  the exercise price is currently per share and the warrants are currently exercisable for a total of  shares 
the notes mature on september   with interest payable semi annually at a rate of per annum 
we have the right to redeem the notes at any time after september  with a declining premium 
the maturit y of the notes can be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default as such term is defined in the indenture governing the notes the indenture 
the indenture also contains various restrictive covenants  including limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments  limitations on incurrence of indebtedness  and limitations on asset sales  the violation of which would result in an event of default 
the first series of warrants the series a warrants is exercisable at any time and as of january  represents a total of  shares 
the second series of warrants the series b warrants became exercisable following stockholder approval of such exercise at a special meeting of our stockholders on june  and as of january  represents a total of  shares 
we also entered into agreements with th e investors to file registration statements with the securities and exchange commission  for the benefit of the investors  with respect to the notes and the warrants 
under the terms of the warrants  the exercise price will be paid by the investors to us solely in cash 
the sale of the notes and warrants pursuant to the securities purchase agreement was made in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of the act pursuant to section of the act 
the warrants expire on september   although we have the right under certain conditions to require that they be exercised at any time if our common stock trades at per share or more for five consecutive tradin g days assuming the shares being issued upon exercise are registered shares 
the fair value of the warrants at the date of the transaction was estimated at million and was recorded in warrant liability on the consoli dated balance sheet  with the offset recorded as a discount on the notes 
this dis count is being amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method over th e ten year life of the notes 
the overall interest rate on the notes  considering th e amortization of the discount  is approximately 
eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock eitf requires freestanding contracts that are settled in a company s own stock  including common stock warrants  to be designated as an equity instrument  asset or liability 
under the provisions of eitf  a contract designated as an asset or liability must be carried at fair value unti l the contract meets the requirements for classification as equity  until the contract is exercised or until the contract expires 
as of december  an d  we have classified these warrants as a liability  as noted above  because the requirements of eitf for classification of the warrants as equity had not been met 
during the period the warrants are classified as a liability  any changes in fair value are and will continue to be reported as fair value adjustment for warrants in the consolidated statement of income 
due primarily to the increase in the market value of our common stock during the last quarter of  the fair market value of the warrants increased from million at september  to million at december  as a result  during the three months ended december   we recorded a non cash expense of million for which no tax benefit is derived which was reflected as fair value adjustment for warrants on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
due to changes to items which affect the calculation of the fair value of the warrants  primarily the change in the market value of our common stock during the year of  the estimated fair market value of these warrants decreased from million at december  to million at december  as a result  during the year ended december   we recorded non cash income of million for which no tax expense is derived which ha s been reflected as fair value adjustment for warrants on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
a registration statement for the warrants wa s filed with the sec and declared effective on february  it is management s belief that this was the final criteria to be met under the provisions of eitf for classification of the warrants as equity 
therefore  the volatility of our earnings resulting from the classification of these warrants as a liability will be limited to the change in the value of these warrants between december  and february  we estimate tha t the value of the warrants was million at february   which will result in a non cash expense of million to be recorded during the three months ending march  the value of the warrants at february  will be re classified from liabilities to additional paid in capital during the quarter ending march  on november   we sold million total principal amount of additional notes the november notes due to eight investors under the same indenture used for the million unsecured financing completed during september the terms of the november notes are identical to those of the notes sold during september as described previously in this document with the following exceptions there were no warrants associated with the november notes and the original issue discount on the november  notes was approximately versus for the september notes 
the november  notes were sold at a discount which provided net proceeds totaling million 
the net proceeds have been used for general corporate purposes  including  but not limited to the purchase of equipment  retirement of debt  acquisitions  and or working capital 
during and the first quarter of  we  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the notes and holders of a majority of the warrants  and the warrant agent for the holders of the warrants  entered into a series of amendments to certain agreements relating to the outstanding notes and warrants 
these amendments extended the dates by which we were required to take certain actions with respect to the notes and warrants 
specifically  the amendments i extended from april  to june  the date by which we were required to seek stockholder approval for the purpose of ratifyin g the issuance of the series b warrants  ii extended from may  to august  the date by which we were required to file a registration statement wit h the sec with respect to the warrants  iii extended from may  to august  the date by which we were required to file a registration statement wit h the sec with respect to the notes  and iv extended from october  to april l  the date on which liquidated damages were to become payable with respect to the notes and or the warrants if they had not been registered wit h the sec 
the registration statements for both the notes and the warrants wer e originally submitted to the sec on august  as a result of these amendments  we were obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to have these registration statements declared effective by the sec by march  i f either of these registration statements had not been effective by april  we would have been required to pay liquidated damages to the holders of these securities based upon a value of million for the notes and million for the warrants 
for the first days  the amount of liquidated damages to be paid related to the warrants and the notes would have been calculated using a rate of per annum for each day the registration statements were not effective after april  this percentage would have been increased by for each day period  until these conditions were met up to a maximum of per annum 
the registration statement for the warrants was declared effective on february  therefore  we will not be required to pay liquidated damages related to the warrants 
in addition  it is management s belief that this was the final criteria to be met under the provisions of eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock  for classification of the warrants as equity 
therefore  the volatility of our earnings resulting from the classification of these warrants as a liability wil l be limited to the change in the value of these warrants between december  and february  we estimate that the value of the warrants was million at february   which will result in a non cash expense of million to be recorded during the three months ending march  the value of the warrants at february  will be re classified from liabilities to additional paid in capital during the quarter ending march  the registration statement for the notes was declared effective on february  during october  the investor rights agreement relating to the warrants was amended to permanently eliminate the liquidated damages penalt y for the warrants described above once the registration statement for the warrants was declared effective by the sec 
as noted above  the registration statement for the warrants was declared effective on february   permanently eliminating the liquidated damages penalty

pursuant to a supplemental indenture dated as of december   section of the indenture  which generally prohibits the existence of contractual restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or distributions to the parent company  interpool inc  was amended 
the december  supplemental indenture added a new exception to section b so as to permit our subsidiaries to agree to those restrictions that are contained in the fortis facility and in the dvb facility on the ability of interpool limited and icl to pay dividends and distributions to interpool inc  as described above 
finally  pursuant to a supplemental indenture dated as of december   section of the indenture  which limits the amount of cash dividends  distributions and other restricted payments that may be made by our parent company interpool inc to ou r stockholders  was amended 
the december  supplemental indenture modifie d clause of section b to provide that  in addition to the other specifie d exceptions  dividends and distributions may be paid in the aggregate amount of million an increase from the million permitted under the original indenture from and after the date of the indenture 
at a special meeting of our stockholders held on june   holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock approved a resolution ratifying the issuance by us of the series b warrants and the issuance of common stock upon exercise of such series b warrants by the holders this affirmative vote satisfied one of the requirements of the warrant agreemen t relating to the warrants 
as a result of this vote  the series b warrants are now exercisable to purchase shares of common stock in accordance with their terms

cai owns and leases in its own fleet of containers and also manages  for a fee  containers owned by us and by third parties 
we entered into our operating relationship with cai primarily to facilitate the leasing in the short term market of containers coming off long term operating lease  to gain access to new companies looking to lease containers on a long term basis and to realize cost efficiencies from the operation of a coordinated container lease marketing group 
for containers managed by cai for us in the short term market  we earn the net operating incom e and pay cai a fee for managing our equipment and leasing it on our behalf 
the management fee calculation is based on the average daily net operating income o f cai s fleet of owned  leased in and managed containers including the portion of cai s fleet that consists of our equipment for each day such managed containers are part of the cai fleet 
the marketing group  which is organized as a wholly owned subsidiary of interpool  is responsible for soliciting container lease business for both interpool and cai  including long term operating and direct financing lease business and short term lease business under master lease agreements 
pursuant to our agreements with cai  we have a right to purchase all long term operating and direct financing lease business generated by the marketing group  subject to offering to cai  at cost  of this long term operating and direct financing lease business plus an additional portion of the long term lease business to be mutually agreed with cai for sale by cai to investors for whom cai manages containers 
by mutual agreement  cai has purchased for its own account and for the account of third party investors long term operating and direct financing lease business the marketing group has generated in excess of of the marketing group s long term operating and direct financing lease business 
our existing agreement s with cai also contemplated that we would pay cai an annual earn out fee in consideration for the transfer of cai s marketing employees to the marketing group  but  to date  by mutual agreement  this provision has been waived 
in addition  on occasion  we have entered into transactions with cai pursuant to which we have acquired equipment  and the related leases  from cai on terms that resulted in a profit for cai 
such equipment  as well as certain other containers purchased from time to time  are currently managed for us by cai for a fee based upon the actual net operating income earned by such containers  or in certain instances  for a flat fee 
in april  we reached an agreement with cai resolving a number of open matters relating to the various agreements between the two companies  including appropriate remedial compensation for age differences between our containers managed by cai and the balance of cai s managed fleet  pursuant to certain provisions of the operating and administration agreement between us and cai the cai agreement 
pursuant to this agreement with cai  during we paid cai million for resolution of thes e open issues through february  the impact of this agreement was recorde d by us during the three months ended march   as a reduction in consolidated pre tax income of million million net of tax 
as a result of this agreement  we anticipate that the earnings related to certain of our containers managed by cai will be reduced to the extent the average age of such containers exceeds the average age of all other containers in cai s fleet 
in connection with the acquisition of our common equity interest in cai in  we loaned cai million under a subordinated note agreement  which is collateralized by all containers owned by cai as of april  or thereafter acquired  subject to the priority security interest lien of cai s senior credit facility  except for certain excluded collateral 
interest on this subordinated note is at an annual fixed rate of and is payable quarterly 
the original repayment terms required mandatory quarterly principal payments of million beginning july  and ending on april  the subordinated note was subject to certain financial covenants and was cross collateralized with cai s senior credit facility  subject to the terms of a subordination agreement 
on june   cai entered into an amended million senior revolving credit agreement with a group of financial institutions 
to facilitate the closing of this new credit facility  we agreed to extend the repayment terms of our subordinated note so as to require mandatory quarterly principal payments of million beginning july  and ending on april  we also agreed to modify certain financial covenants in the subordinated note 
interest on the subordinated note continues to accrue at an annual fixed rate of  payable quarterly 
the subordinated note continued to be cross collateralized with cai s senior credit agreement  subject to the terms of an amended and restated subordination agreement 
in connection wit h these modifications  mr 
ogawa  cai s chief executive officer and the owner of the common equity interest in cai that we do not own  agreed that we would have the right to designate a majority of the members of cai s board of directors  so long as the subordinated note remained outstanding 
as a resul t of these transactions and gaining a majority position on cai s board  our financial statements have included cai as a consolidated subsidiary since june on april   cai replaced its million secured revolving credit facility  which had an outstanding principal balance of million as of march  not including letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million as of march  and was scheduled to expire on jun e   with a new senior secured revolving credit facility 
the new credit facility has a total commitment amount of up to million and was provided by a group of banks 
the interest rate under the revolving line of credit varie s depending upon whether the loans are characterized as base rate loans or eurodollar rate loans 
in addition  there is a commitment fee on the unused amount of the total commitment which fee is payable quarterly in arrears 
the new credit facility provides that swing line loans up to million in the aggregate and standby letters of credit up to million in the aggregate will be available to cai  which sublimits are part of  and not in addition to  the total commitment of million under the new credit facility 
the term of this revolving credit facility is three years 
the revolving credit facility contains various financial and other covenants 
on april   in connection with the first advance under a new secured revolving credit facility established by cai  cai repaid the outstandin g principal balance of million on the existing revolving credit facility plus interest and additional fees and repaid million of the amounts owe d to us under the outstanding million subordinated note issued by cai to us in this repayment returned the subordinated note to the original payment schedule in effect before it was modified in the remaining balance of the subordinated note  totaling million as of december   is required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments of approximately million through april  in addition  the financial covenants associated with this subordinated note were amended in april a total of million and million was outstanding under cai s senior revolving credit facilities at december  and  respectively 
borrowings under cai s senior credit facility are secured by substantially all of cai s assets  other than certain excluded assets 
the senior credit facility contains various financial and other covenants 
at december   cai was in compliance with these covenants 
as noted above  in connection with the june modifications to our subordinated note  mr 
ogawa agreed that  until the subordinated note is paid in full  we would have the right to designate a majority of the members of cai s board of directors 
since the time this agreement was entered into  cai s board of directors has consisted of five directors  three of whom were appointed by us and two of whom were appointed by mr 
ogawa 
cai managemen t has advised us that cai may wish to repay the remaining balance of the subordinated note during and cai has obtained the consent of the lenders under its new secured revolving credit facility to make such repayment 
under the terms of the amended shareholder agreement between us and mr 
ogawa  this repayment would result in cai s board of directors being comprised of an equal number of directors appointed by us and by mr 
ogawa 
any such change in the composition of cai s board of directors would require that we no longer consolidate cai in our financial statements from and after the date of such change 
instead  we would record our investment in cai under the equity method of accounting 
we have had preliminary discussions with mr 
ogawa about potential modifications to the shareholder agreement that would preserve our majority position on cai s board of directors for some period of time after a repayment of the subordinated note 
to date  no agreement has been reached on any such modifications  nor has cai made a firm decision to repay the subordinated note prior to its final maturity in april see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in may  cai granted options to certain of its key employees to purchase series a cumulative preferred stock of cai 
each of these individuals was given the opportunity to exercise these options by investing the after tax proceeds from stock appreciation rights previously granted to these employees 
in addition  cai provided a full recourse loan to finance the remaining portion of the exercise price 
this loan was in the form of a promissory note that was secured by a pledge of the stock acquired through the exercise of the options 
the options were exercised in may at an exercise price of per shar e and  at december   there were  outstanding shares of this cai preferred stock 
so long as the preferred stock has not yet been redeemed by cai or the employee  at such time as a liquidity event takes place  defined as an initial public offering or a sale to parties other than mr 
ogawa or interpool  the preferred stock will be converted into an equal number of shares of cai s common stock 
this preferred stock is subject to variable accounting in cai s financial statements for the portion of the preferred stock acquired using the proceeds of the loan from cai 
during the years ended december  and  the management of cai concluded that there was no change to the valuation of the preferred shares of cai and  therefore  no stock compensation charge was recorded in cai s financial statements for those periods 
in the fourth quarter of  cai determined that a change in the valuation of its preferred shares had  in fact  taken place during these periods as well as for the year ended december  we have determined that the effect of this previously undetected error related to cai s valuation of its preferred stock a nd corresponding stock compensation charge is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended decembe r  and in order to properly reflect these adjustments for the three years ended december   we recorded additional compensation expense of million million  net of minority interest income during the fourth quarter of during the third quarter of  pursuant to the terms of the shareholder agreement we entered into with mr 
ogawa when we acquired our common equity interest in cai in  mr 
ogawa notified us that he was exercising his contractual right to request an independent valuation of cai 
an investment banking firm was engaged by cai s board of directors to conduct this valuation and the valuation was completed during the fourth quarter of we advised mr 
ogawa that  after review of this valuation  we had decided not to exercise our right under the shareholder agreement to make an offer to acquire his common equity interest in cai for an amount equal to his percentage interest of the fair value of cai as determined by the investment banking firm 
the shareholder agreement provides that if we do not elect to make such an offer  mr 
ogawa has a right to require cai to take the necessary steps to effect an initial public offering to sell his equity  with all costs associated with any such initial public offering of cai being borne by cai 
mr 
ogawa has requested that cai proceed with the steps necessary to register his equity interest in cai for sale by him in an initial public offering 
in response to mr 
ogawa s request  cai has engaged an investment banking firm to manage an initial public offering 
cai and its investment bankers  together with their advisors  have commenced preparation of an s registration statement for filin g with the sec sometime during in the event that cai s initial public offering is consummated  cai would become a public company 
in connection with cai s anticipated public offering  we expect to consider potential changes to the terms of the existing agreements between us and cai and to the terms of the shareholder agreement between us and mr 
ogawa 
to date  however  no agreement has been reached regarding any such changes 
in addition  we are currently evaluating the impact of cai s initial public offering on our current common equity position in cai 
cai s ability to complete a public offering will depend upon a number of factors  including market conditions  industry conditions and developments in cai s business 
accordingly  there is no assurance that cai s public offering will be completed within the anticipated time frame or at all

in addition  since these options were granted to mr 
serenbetz as compensation for services rendered  we are entitled to claim a tax deduction for non employee compensation on our federal tax return 
since we did not recognize compensation expense on the grant or exercise of these options  the tax benefit amounting to million has been recorded as additional paid in capital at the time these options were exercised 
no shares were repurchased during stock options exercised for cash on october   mr 
raoul witteveen  former president of the company  exercised his remaining  options under the terms of the stock optio n plan

a tax benefit based on the difference between the market price of the stock as of the modification date and the exercise price was recorded in october at the time the company recognized compensation expense relating to a modification of the options 
the increase in the stock price from the modification date per share to the exercise date per share resulted in an additional ta x benefit amounting to million  which has been recorded as additional paid in capital during the fourth quarter of united states federal income tax we are subject to federal and state income taxes as a subchapter c corporation under the internal revenue code 
interpool  trac lease and other united states subsidiaries file a consolidated united states federal income tax return 
this consolidated group is liable for federal income taxes o n its worldwide income 
personal holding company issues 
the federal income tax laws have two requirements for classifying a company as a personal holding company 
we and our subsidiaries currently satisfy the first requirement  the ownership of more than of the value of interpool s stock by five or fewer individuals 
the second requirement is that at least of such corporation s adjusted ordinary gross income constitutes personal holding company income  which depends upon the income mix for the year 
based upon the operating results for  and principally due to the million distribution made by interpool limited pursuant to the implemented repatriation plan  we will be considered a personal holding company for federal income tax purposes for as a personal holding company  in addition to our regular federal income tax liability our undistributed personal holding company income generally taxable income with certain adjustments  including a deduction for federal income taxes and dividends paid will be subject to a personal holding company tax at the rate of 
however  the regular dividends and the special dividends paid during combined with the additional special dividend paid on january  are sufficient to avoid having any undistributed personal holding company income for  and no personal holding company tax will be imposed for there can be no assurance  however  that we will not at some point in the future become liable for personal holding company tax 
furthermore  we may at some point in the future elect to increase the dividend rate on our common stock in order to avoi d personal holding company tax 
we have incurred certain losses from leasing activities that are characterized for tax purposes as suspended passive activity losses 
these losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset income from future leasing activities 
as of december   such suspended passive activity loss carryovers  including the passive activity loss carryovers of cai  totaled approximately million 
interpool limited and icl 
under certain circumstances  interpool may be liable for united states federal income taxes o n earnings of interpool limited  icl and any other foreign subsidiaries of ours  whether or not such earnings are distributed to us 
this would occur if interpool limited  icl or any other foreign subsidiary of ours  realized subpart f income as defined in the code or if it were to have an increase in earnings invested in united states property 
subpart f income includes foreign personal holding company income  such as dividends  interest and rents 
although a substantial portion of interpool limited s and icl s income consists of rents from container leasing activities  we believe that such rents are not subpart f income because they ar e derived from the active conduct of a trade or business and received from unrelated persons 
however  interpool limited has received some dividend and interest income in past years  which was taxed as subpart f income 
in addition  during another foreign subsidiary of ours  interpool finance corporation  received some interest income which was taxed as subpart f income 
a parent company is also subject to taxation when a foreign subsidiary increases the amount of its earnings invested in united states property during any calendar year 
we do not expect that interpool limited  icl or any other foreign subsidiary of ours will invest any earnings in united states property 
repatriation 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca created a temporary incentive for us multinationals  such as interpool  to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us at an effective us federal tax rate of approximately 
on december   pursuant to the ajca  interpool  inc s wholly owned barbados subsidiary  interpool limited  made a distribution to interpool  inc of approximately million the distribution  as part of a plan approved by interpool  inc s board of directors to repatriate accumulated and current earnings and profits of interpool limited  which previously had been considered permanently reinvested outside the united states 
during  we recorded expenses related to the distribution of million which included a federal tax provision expense and current tax liability of million due to the distribution and a state tax provision expense and current tax liability of million due to interpool limited s transfer of substantially all of its operating assets and liabilities to interpool containers limited 
united states barbados income tax convention 
the business of interpool limited and icl is managed and controlled in barbados 
under the income tax convention between the united states and barbados  including any protocols and amendments the tax treaty  any profits of interpool limited or icl from leasing of containers used in international trade generally are taxable only in barbados and not in the united states 
interpool limited and icl are entitled to the benefits of the tax convention for each year by satisfying the two pronged test to the limitation of benefits provision more than of the shares of interpool limited and icl are owned  directly or indirectly  by any combination of individual united states residents or citizens the us ownership test  and its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to meet liabilities to persons who are not residents or citizens of the united states the base erosion test 
we believe interpool limited and icl passed both of these tests and were eligible for the benefits o f the tax treaty through december  if interpool limited or icl had cease d to be eligible for the benefits of the tax treaty  a substantial portion of its income would become subject to the united states federal income tax and the branch profits tax 
in addition to having to satisfy the us ownership and base erosion tests described above  starting january  interpool limited and icl are only eligible for the tax treaty benefits with respect to its container rental and sales income if interpool  inc is listed on a recognized stock exchange and interpool  inc s stock is primarily and regularly traded on such exchange 
during april interpool  inc was de listed by the new york stock exchange 
during this de listing  our common stock was traded on the over the counter market under the symbol ipli 
in december  after making all delinquent sec filings  we applied for relisting on the new york stock exchange 
on january  our common stock was re listed on the new york stock exchange  a recognized stock exchange within the meaning of the tax treaty 
interpool believes this listing and its current trading volume satisfies the primarily and regularly traded requirements of the tax treaty  that interpool limited qualified again for benefits under the tax treaty on january   and that icl qualified under the tax treaty when it began operations as of close of business on november  we have estimated there should be no us current tax expense for the period january  to january   when interpool limited was not eligible for the tax treaty 
barbados tax returns 
as companies resident in barbados  interpool limited and icl are required to file tax returns in barbado s and pay any tax liability to barbados 
prior to the third quarter of  no barbados tax returns had been prepared or filed for interpool limited for any period subsequent to its tax year 
as of september   all previousl y outstanding barbados tax returns tax years were filed 
there was no underpayment of taxes  interest or penalties other than a nominal late filing penalty with the filing of these returns 
state and local taxes income taxes 
interpool and trac lease are liable for state and local income taxes on their income  and interpool limited and icl are liable for state and local income taxes on its earnings attributable to operations in the united states  if any 
sales tax 
to date  interpool  trac lease  interpool limited  and icl generally have not paid sales taxes on their long term leasing revenues to the states in which they conduct business because management believes such revenues to be exempt from state sales taxes on several grounds  including a long standing interpretation of the commerce clause of the united states constitution that would prohibit the imposition of a tax on cargo containers and chassis used primarily for transportation of goods in interstate commerce or international trade 
under the terms of our equipment leases  in th e event sales tax is imposed  we would generally be entitled to recover any such sales tax from our lessees 
we do  however  collect and remit sales tax on thei r short term chassis pool intrastate activity 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  the effects of inflation on administrative and operating expenses have been largely offset through economies of scale achieved through expansion of the business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management has identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on these and other significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies and estimates are considered critical due to the existence of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made  the likelihood of changes in estimates from period to period and the potential impact that these estimates can have on our financial statements 
the following accounting policies and estimates include inherent risks and uncertainties related to judgments and assumptions made by management 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is set on a quarterly basis and is based on the risk profile of the receivables  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and non performing accounts and economic conditions  as well as the value of underlying collateral 
changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance is intended to provide for losses inherent in the accounts receivable  and requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
accounting for leasing equipment long lived assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives to residual values that approximate fair value 
equipment useful lives ar e based upon actual experience in our fleet as well as the useful lives assigned to the equipment by independent appraisers 
we continue to review our depreciation policies on a regular basis to evaluate if changes have taken plac e that would suggest that a change in the depreciation policies is warranted 
periodically a determination is made as to whether the carrying amount of the fleet exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
in addition  all idle equipment is evaluated to determine whether the units will be repaired and returned to service or sold based upon the best economic alternative 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value 
lease residual values operating lease equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated t o estimated residual values using the straight line basis of depreciation over their estimated useful lives 
direct financing leases are recorded at the aggregated future minimum lease payments  including any bargain or economically compelled purchase options granted to the customer  less unearned income 
we generally bear greater risk in operating lease transactions versus direct financing lease transactions due to redeployment costs and related risks that are avoided under a direct financing lease 
management performs annual reviews of the estimated residual values which can vary depending on a number of factors 
goodwill goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas is reviewed for possible impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
a review of goodwill may be initiated prior to conducting the annual analysis if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carryin g value of goodwill may be impaired 
during this review  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and market place data 
accounting for customer defaults we have sought to reduce credit risk by maintaining insurance against customer insolvency and equipment related losses 
we cease the recognition of lease revenues for amounts billable to the lessee after the lease default date at the time we determine that such amounts are not probable of collection from the lessee 
in connection with the accounting for the insurance policy  we record a receivable which is limited to the actual costs incurred or losses recognized that would have been billable to the lessee pursuant to the lease contract which are also covered by the insurance contracts 
items that are covered under the insurance contracts  for amounts billable to the lessee in accordance with the lease  that are in excess of costs incurred and losses recognized by us  are considered a gain contingency 
derivative financial instruments we utilize interest rate swaps to hedge against the effects of future interest rate fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
derivative instruments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values in accounts payable and accrued expenses and changes in fair values are recognized immediately in earnings  unless the derivatives qualify as hedges of future cash flows 
for derivatives qualifying as hedges of future cash flows  the effective portion of changes in fair value is recorded temporarily in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of equity and contractual cash flows  along with the related impact of the hedged items  continue to be recognized in earnings 
any ineffective portion of a hedge is reported in current earnings 
amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction impacts earnings 
the net interest differential  including premiums paid or received  if any  on interest rate swaps  is recognized on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense to correspond with the hedged position 
we may  at our discretion  terminate or redesignate any interest rate swap agreement prior to maturity 
at that time  any gains or losses on termination would continue to amortize into income to correspond to the recognition of interest on the hedged debt 
if such debt instrument was also terminated  the gain or loss associated with the terminated derivative included in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time of termination of the debt would be recognized in the consolidated income statement at that time 
warrant valuation as of december   our outstanding warrants are classified as a liability in accordance with eitf under the provisions of eitf  a contract designated as an asset or liability must be carried at fair value until the contract meets the requirements for treatment as equity  until the contract is exercised or until the contract expires 
accordingly  future changes to the fair market value of these warrants have the potential to cause volatility in our future results 
fo r the period of time that these warrants are classified as a liability  any increase in the fair market value of the warrants will result in an additional non cash expense to the consolidated statements of income 
to the extent the fair market value of the warrants decreases during this period  we will record non cash income in our consolidated statements of income 
a registration statement for the warrants was filed with the sec and was declared effective on february  it is management s belief that this was the final criteria to be met under the provisions of eitf for classification of the warrants as equity 
therefore  the volatility of our earnings resulting from th e classification of these warrants as a liability will be limited to the change i n the value of these warrants between december  and february  se e note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the book values and the tax basis of particular assets and liabilities  using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence which may be subject to management estimates  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in certain situations  a taxing authority may challenge positions adopted in our income tax filings 
we may apply a different tax treatment for these selected transactions in filing the tax return than for income tax financial reporting purposes 
we regularly assess the tax positions for such transactions and include reserves for those differences in position 
the reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired or the matter is otherwise resolved 
in addition  we believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
through december  we claimed tax benefits under an income tax convention between the united states and barbados tax treaty  the jurisdiction in which our subsidiaries  interpool limited and icl  operate our international container leasing business  are incorporated 
specifically  under the tax treaty  any profits of interpool limited or icl from leasing of containers used in international trade generally are taxable only in barbados a t an approximate tax rate  and not in the united states 
interpool limited and icl are entitled to the benefits of the tax treaty for each year that more than of the shares of interpool limited and icl were owned  directly or indirectly  by any combination of individual united states residents or citizen s the us ownership test and its income was not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to meet liabilities to persons who were not residents or citizens of the united states the base erosion test 
we believe interpool limited and icl passed both of these tests through december  beginning january   in addition to having to satisfy the us ownership and base erosion tests described above  interpool limited and icl are only eligible for the tax treaty benefits with respect to its container rental and sales income if interpool  inc is listed on a recognized stock exchange and interpool  inc s stock is primarily and regularly traded on such exchange 
as described elsewhere in this report  on january  our common stock was listed on the new york stock exchange  a recognized stock exchange within the meaning of the post treaty 
interpool believes this listing and its current trading volume satisfies the primarily and regularly traded requirements of the tax treaty  that interpool limited qualified for benefits under the tax treaty again on january   and that icl qualified for the benefits under the tax treaty when it began operations 
we have estimated there should be no us current tax expense for the period january  to january   when interpool limited was not eligible for the tax treaty 
historically  no deferred us federal income taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings of interpool limited since it is our past practice and future intention to permanently reinvest such earnings 
no deferred us federa l income taxes have been provided on the unremitted earnings of icl since it is our current and future intention to permanently reinvest such earnings 
we have documented our ability to reinvest earnings generated annually from our international operations 
this documentation contains certain management judgments and estimates of economic conditions and the future demand for containers 
any unremitted earnings that we would be unable to reinvest in our international operations could be subject to taxation at united states tax rates 
in october  the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca created a temporary incentive for us multinationals  such as interpool  to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us at an effective us federal tax rat e of approximately 
on december   pursuant to the ajca  interpool limited made a distribution to interpool  inc of approximately million the distribution  as part of a plan approved by interpool  inc s board of directors to repatriate accumulated and current earnings and profits of interpool limited  which previously had been considered permanently reinvested outside the united states 
during  we recorded expenses related to the distribution of million which included federal tax provision expense and current tax liability of million due to the distribution and a state tax provision expense and current tax liability of million due to interpool limited s transfer of substantially all of its operating assets and liabilities to interpool containers limited 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  sfas 
this new standard replaces accounting principles board opinion  accounting changes  and fasb no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
among other changes  sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principl e be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented using the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived non financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of the provisions of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial positions or liquidity 
in december  the fasb published sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r which will be effective for periods beginning after june  we currently account for our stock option plans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which allows for the retention of principles within accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
as permitted  we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method described in apb and related interpretations 
apb generally requires compensation costs  if any  to be recognized for the difference between the exercise price and the market price o f the underlying stock on the date of the grant 
alternatively  sfas r employs fair value based measurement and generally results in the recognition o f compensation expense for all stock based awards 
the adoption of sfas r will require the recognition of compensation expense for all share based compensation 
based on the number of options currently outstanding  the adoptio n of sfas r is expected to result in compensation expense  net of tax  of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all future grants of share based compensation will result in the recognition of additional compensation expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the nature of our business exposes us to market risk arising from changes in interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk to protect margins on existing transactions 
interest rate risk is the risk of earnings volatility attributable to changes in interest rates 
additionally  we consider interest rate swap contracts as an integral part of borrowing transactions 
generally we seek to reduce our exposure by entering into amortizing interest rate swap contracts  which coincide with the principal and maturity of the underlying deb t instruments hedged 
we do not use leveraged swaps and do not use leverage in an y of our investment activities that would put principal capital at risk 
the following table sets forth principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt and capital lease obligations at december  dollars in thousands total obligation thereafter variable rate facilities average interest rate fixed rate facilities average interest rate total debt average interest rate these fixed rate facilities include variable instruments that have been converted to fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
based on outstanding debt balances at december  of variable rate facilities  which have not been converted to fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps  a change in variable interest rates would have resulted in a million change in pre tax earnings 
for further information regarding our floating and fixed rate debt  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk we maintain detailed credit records about our customers 
our credit policy sets different maximum exposure limits for our customers 
credit criteria may include  but are not limited to  customer trade route  country  social and political climate  assessments of net worth  asset ownership  bank and trade credit references  credit bureau reports  operational history and financial strength 
we seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining insurance coverage against customer insolvency and related equipment losses 
we maintain contingen t physical damage  recovery and loss of revenue insurance  which provides coverag e in the event of a customer s insolvency  bankruptcy or default giving rise to our demand for return of all of our equipment 
the policy covers the cost of recovering our equipment from the customer  including repositioning cost  damag e to the equipment and the value of equipment which could not be located or was uneconomical to recover 
it also covers a portion of the equipment leasing revenue that we might lose as a result of the customer s default ie  up to days of lease payments following an occurrence under the policy 
our current policy  which commenced april   includes coverage of million with a million deductible  per occurrence 
this coverage automatically renews for at least two additional one year terms on each anniversary of the commencement date 
all renewals are subject to maintaining a claim experience that does not exceed stated percentages of the policy premiums there can be no assurance that this or similar coverage will be available in th e future or that such insurance will cover the entirety of any loss 
beginning january   we also maintain credit insurance which provides complementary coverage upon the occurrence of a customer s insolvency  bankruptcy or default giving rise to our demand for return of all our equipment 
the policy covers a portion of the equipment leasing revenues we might lose as a result of the customer s default ie  up to days of lease payments that accrue prior to an occurrence under the policy 
our curren t policy includes coverage of million with a million deductible  per year  in the aggregate 
the policy has a one year term 
there can be no assurance that this or similar coverage will be available in the future or that such insurance will cover the entirety of any loss 
at december   approximately of accounts receivable and of the net investment in direct financing leases were from customers outside of th e united states 
in  our top customers represented approximately of consolidated billings  with no single customer accounting for more than 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts includes our estimate of allowances necessary for receivables on both operating and direct financing lease receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is developed based on tw o key components specific reserves for receivables which are impaired for which management believes full collection is doubtful and reserves for estimated losses inherent in the receivables based upon historical trends 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in our accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to provide for losses inherent in the accounts receivable  and requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
in addition  changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
direct financin g leases are evaluated on a case by case basis 
when evaluating our operating and direct financing lease receivables for impairment  we consider  among other things  the level of past due amounts of the respective receivable  the borrower s financial condition  credit quality indicators of the borrower  the value of underlying collateral and third party credit enhancements such as guarantees and insurance policies 
once a direct financing lease is determined to be non performing  our procedures provide for the following events to take place in order to evaluate collectibility the past due amounts are reclassified to accounts receivable  the equipment value supporting such direct financing lease is reclassified to leasing equipment  and collectibility is evaluated  taking into consideration equipment book value and the total outstanding receivable  as well as the likelihood of collection through the recovery of equipment 
the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based upon a quarterly review of the collectibility of our receivables 
this review is based on the risk profile of the receivables  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and economic conditions  as well as the value of underlying collateral in the case of direct financing leas e receivables 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  included in accounts receivable are non performing receivables of million and million  respectively 
our average non performing receivables are million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively
