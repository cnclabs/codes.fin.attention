northwest pipeline corporation northwest pipeline northwest pipeline is an interstate natural gas transportation company that owns and operates a natural gas pipeline system extending from the san juan basin in northwestern new mexico and southwestern colorado through colorado  utah  wyoming  idaho  oregon and washington to a point on the canadian border near sumas  washington 
northwest pipeline provides services for markets in california  new mexico  colorado  utah  nevada  wyoming  idaho  oregon and washington directly or indirectly through interconnections with other pipelines 
pipeline system and customers at december   northwest pipeline s system  having long term firm transportation agreements with peaking capacity of approximately mmdt of natural gas per day  was composed of approximately  miles of mainline and lateral transmission pipelines and transmission compressor stations having a combined sea level rated capacity of approximately  horsepower 
in december  we received an amended corrective action order acao from the office of pipeline safety ops regarding a segment of one of our natural gas pipelines in western washington 
the pipeline experienced two breaks in and we subsequently idled the pipeline segment until its integrity could be assured 

table of contents by june we had successfully completed our hydrostatic testing program and returned to service miles of the miles of pipe affected by the acao 
that effort has restored mdt d of the mdt d of idled capacity and is anticipated to be adequate to meet most market conditions 
to date our ability to serve the market demand has not been significantly impacted 
the restored facilities will be monitored and tested as necessary until they are ultimately replaced in through december   approximately million has been spent on testing and remediation costs  including approximately million related to one segment of pipe that we determined not to return to service and was therefore written off in the second quarter of as required by ops  we plan to replace all capacity associated with the segment affected by the acao by november to meet long term demands 
we conducted a reverse open season to determine whether any existing customers were willing to relinquish or reduce their capacity commitments to allow us to reduce the scope of pipeline replacement facilities 
that resulted in mdt d of capacity being relinquished and incorporated into the replacement project 
on november   we filed an application with the ferc for certificate authorization to construct and operate the capacity replacement project 
this project entails the abandonment of approximately miles of the existing inch pipeline  and the construction of approximately miles of new inch pipeline and an additional  net horsepower of compression at two existing compressor stations 
the original cost of the abandoned assets and any cost of removal  net of salvage  will be charged to accumulated depreciation 
at december   the net book value of the assets to be abandoned was million 
the estimated total cost of the proposed capacity replacement project included in the filing is approximately million  net of a million contribution in aid of construction from a shipper that agreed to relinquish mdt d of capacity 
a favorable preliminary determination was issued in may and we received and accepted the final ferc certificate in september we began construction of certain critical river crossings in late the main construction of pipeline and compression will begin in early with an anticipated in service date of november  we anticipate filing a rate case to recover the capitalized costs relating to restoration and replacement facilities to become effective following the in service date of the replacement facilities 
in  northwest pipeline served a total of transportation and storage customers 
transportation customers include distribution companies  municipalities  interstate and intrastate pipelines  gas marketers and direct industrial users 
the two largest customers of northwest pipeline in accounted for approximately percent and percent  of its total operating revenues 
no other customer accounted for more than percent of northwest pipeline s total operating revenues in northwest pipeline s firm transportation agreements are generally long term agreements with various expiration dates and account for the major portion of northwest pipeline s business 
additionally  northwest pipeline offers interruptible and short term firm transportation service 
as a part of its transportation services  northwest pipeline utilizes underground storage facilities in utah and washington enabling it to balance daily receipts and deliveries 
northwest pipeline also owns and operates an lng storage facility in washington that provides service for customers during a few days of extreme demands 
these storage facilities have an aggregate firm delivery capacity of approximately million cubic feet of gas per day 
northwest pipeline expansion projects colorado gas pipeline expansion in january  we filed an application with the ferc to construct a mile expansion that would provide additional capacity in northwest colorado 
the planned expansion would increase capacity by mdt d through the inch diameter line and is estimated to cost million 
we are currently in discussions with shippers to determine the level of commitment and anticipate beginning service on the expansion in january 
table of contents operating statistics the following table summarizes volume and capacity data for the northwest pipeline system for the periods indicated in trillion british thermal units total transportation volume average daily transportation volumes average daily reserved capacity under long term base firm contracts  excluding peak capacity average daily reserved capacity under short term firm contracts consists primarily of additional capacity created from time to time through the installation of new receipt or delivery points or the segmentation of existing mainline capacity 
such capacity is generally marketed on a short term firm basis  because it does not involve the construction of additional mainline capacity 
gulfstream natural gas system  llc gulfstream gulfstream is a natural gas pipeline system extending from the mobile bay area in alabama to markets in florida 
in december  gulfstream filed an application with the ferc to allow gulfstream to complete the construction of its approved facilities in phases 
in may  the first phase of the project was placed into service at a cost of approximately billion 
the second phase of the project was placed into service on february  the total capital cost of both phases of the project is approximately billion 
at december   our investment in gulfstream was million 
gas pipeline and duke energy  through their respective subsidiaries  each hold a percent ownership interest in gulfstream and provide operating services for gulfstream 
gulfstream expansion projects gulfstream has entered into a conditional agreement pursuant to which  subject to the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals and other conditions precedent therein  we intend to further expand the system and fully subscribe the existing pipeline system on a long term basis 
the estimated capital cost of this expansion project  if implemented  is anticipated to be approximately million 
in addition  we are pursuing another potential prospect for an expansion 
such expansion  if successful  would require estimated capital costs of not less than million  and would expand the current mainline capacity of million dth per day to at least million dth per day 
implementation of our two proposed expansion projects may require additional compression at station in coden  alabama  and new compression facilities at station in florida 
no significant increase in operations personnel is expected as a result of our two proposed expansion projects 
exploration production our exploration production segment  which is comprised of several wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries  including williams production company llc and williams production rmt company rmt  produces  develops  and manages natural gas reserves primarily located in the rocky mountain primarily new mexico  wyoming and colorado and mid continent oklahoma and texas regions of the united states 
we specialize in natural gas production from tight sands formations and coal bed methane reserves in the piceance  san juan  powder river  arkoma  green river and fort worth basins 
over percent of exploration production s domestic reserves are natural gas 
our exploration production segment also has international oil and gas interests  which include a percent equity interest in apco argentina  inc apco argentina  an oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in argentina  and a percent interest in the la concepcion area located in western venezuela 

table of contents exploration production s primary strategy is to utilize its expertise in the development of tight sands and coal bed methane reserves 
exploration production s current proved undeveloped and probable reserves provide us with strong capital investment opportunities for several years into the future 
exploration production s goal is to drill its existing proved undeveloped reserves  which comprise over percent of proved reserves and to drill in areas of probable reserves 
in addition  exploration production provides a significant amount of equity production that is gathered and or processed by our midstream facilities in the san juan basin 
information for our exploration production segment relates only to domestic activity unless otherwise noted 
we use the terms gross to refer to all wells or acreage in which we have at least a partial working interest and net to refer to our ownership represented by that working interest 
oil and gas properties rocky mountain properties the piceance basin is located in northwestern colorado  where we primarily target tight sands reserves  and is our largest area of concentrated development comprising approximately percent of our proved reserves at december  this area has approximately  undrilled proved locations in inventory 
within this basin  we are also the owner and operator of a natural gas gathering system 
in  we drilled gross wells and produced a net of approximately bcfe of natural gas from the piceance basin 
our estimated proved reserves in the piceance basin at year end were  bcfe 
in march we entered into a contract with helmerich payne nyse hp for the operation of new flexrig drilling rigs  each for a term of three years 
the san juan basin is located in northwest new mexico and southwest colorado 
in  we participated in the drilling of gross wells  of which we operate  and produced a net of approximately bcfe from the san juan basin 
our estimated proved reserves in the san juan basin at year end were bcfe 
located in northeast wyoming  the powder river basin includes large areas with multiple coal seam potential  targeting thick coal bed methane formations at shallow depths 
we operate approximately  wells in the basin and have an interest in approximately  additional wells 
we have a significant inventory of undrilled locations  providing long term drilling opportunities

table of contents the following table summarizes our proved natural gas reserves by basin as of december  percentage of basin proved reserves piceance san juan powder river other no major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has caused a significant change in estimated gas reserves since year end we have not filed on a recurring basis estimates of our total proved net oil and gas reserves with any us regulatory authority or agency other than the department of energy doe and the sec 
the estimates furnished to the doe have been consistent with those furnished to the sec  although exploration production has not yet filed any information with respect to its estimated total reserves at december   with the doe 
certain estimates filed with the doe may not necessarily be directly comparable due to special doe reporting requirements  such as the requirement to report gross operated reserves only 
the underlying estimated reserves for the doe did not differ by more than five percent from the underlying estimated reserves utilized in preparing the estimated reserves reported to the sec 
approximately percent of our year end united states proved reserves estimates were audited in each separate basin by netherland  sewell associates  inc nsai 
when compared on a well by well basis  some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the estimates of nsai 
however  in the opinion of nsai  the estimates of our proved reserves are in the aggregate reasonable by basin and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 
these principles are set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserve information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
nsai is satisfied with our methods and procedures in preparing the december  reserve estimates and saw nothing of an unusual nature that would cause nsai to take exception with the estimates  in the aggregate  as prepared by us 
reserves estimates related to properties underlying the williams coal seam gas royalty trust which comprise another approximately two percent of our total us proved reserves were prepared by miller and lents  ltd

our drilling success rate was percent in  and the following tables summarize domestic drilling activity by number and type of well for the periods indicated number of wells gross wells net wells development drilled successful substantially all our natural gas production is currently being sold to power at prevailing market prices 
because we currently have a low risk drilling program in proven basins  the main component of risk that we manage is price risk 
exploration production natural gas hedges for consist of derivative contracts with power that hedge bbtud in fixed price hedges whole year and approximately bbtud in nymex and regional collars for january through march for projected domestic natural gas production 
power then enters into offsetting derivative contracts with unrelated third parties 
our natural gas production hedges in consisted of bbtud in fixed price hedges  bbtud in nymex collars and an additional bbtud in regional collars for the fourth quarter only 
hedging decisions are made considering the overall williams commodity risk exposure and are not executed independently by exploration production  there are gas purchase hedging contracts executed on behalf of other williams entities which taken as a net position may counteract exploration production gas sales hedging derivatives 
the following table summarizes our sales and cost information for the year indicated total net production sold in bcfe average production costs including production taxes per thousand cubic feet of gas equivalent mcfe produced average sales price per mcfe realized impact of hedging contracts loss acquisitions divestitures exploration production acquired an acreage position in the forth worth basin in north central texas  that includes bcf of proved reserves as of year end our entry into this basin allows us to own an operated position that has potential for significant growth 
it increases our diversification into the mid continent region and allows us to use our horizontal drilling expertise to develop wells in the barnett shale formation 
we sold certain non core assets in the wyoming powder river basin that include approximately bcf of proved reserves 
these assets are outside of our main area of development in the basin and are operated by third parties 
other information in  exploration production conveyed a net profits interest in certain of its properties to the williams coal seam gas royalty trust 
substantially all of the production attributable to the properties conveyed to the trust was from the fruitland coal formation and constituted coal seam gas 
we subsequently 
table of contents sold trust units to the public in an underwritten public offering and retained  trust units then representing percent of outstanding trust units 
we have continued to sell trust units on the open market and as of march   we own  trust units 
international exploration and production interests we also have investments in international oil and gas interests  principally through our approximately percent interest in apco argentina 
if combined with our domestic proved reserves  our international interests would make up percent of our total proved reserves 
midstream our midstream segment  one of the nation s largest natural gas gatherers and processors  has primary service areas concentrated in the major producing basins of san juan  wyoming  the gulf of mexico  venezuela and western canada 
our primary businesses natural gas gathering  treating  and processing  natural gas liquids ngl fractionation  storage and transportation  and oil transportation fall within the middle of the process of taking natural gas and crude oil from the wellhead to the consumer 
ngls  ethylene and propylene are extracted produced at our plants 
these products are used primarily for the manufacture of plastics  home heating and refinery feedstock 
although most of our gas services are performed for a volumetric based fee  a portion of our gas processing contracts are commodity based and include two distinct types of commodity exposure 
the first type includes keep whole processing contracts whereby we own the ngls extracted and replace the lost heating value with natural gas 
under these contracts  we are exposed to the spread between ngls and natural gas prices 
the second type consists of percent of liquids contracts whereby we receive a portion of the extracted liquids with no exposure to the price of natural gas 
under these contracts  we are only exposed to ngl price movements 
our canadian and gulf liquids olefin facilities have an exposure similar to our keep whole contracts 
we are exposed to the spread between the price for natural gas and the products we produce 
in the gulf coast  our feedstock for the ethane cracker is ethane and propane  as a result  we are exposed to the price spread between ethane and propane and ethylene and propylene 
key variables for our business will continue to be revenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either completed or currently under construction  disciplined growth in our core service areas  prices impacting our commodity based processing and olefin activities 
domestic gathering and processing geographically  our midstream natural gas assets are positioned to maximize commercial and operational synergies with our other assets 
for example  most of our offshore gathering and processing assets attach and process or condition natural gas supplies delivered to the transco pipeline 
also  our gathering and processing facilities in the san juan basin handle about percent of our exploration production group s wellhead production in this basin 
several of our western gathering systems serve as critical sources of supply for northwest pipeline customers 
we own and or operate domestic gas gathering and processing assets primarily within the western states of wyoming  colorado and new mexico  and the onshore and offshore shelf and deepwater areas in and around the gulf coast states of texas  louisiana  mississippi and alabama 
these assets consist of approximately  miles of gathering pipelines  nine processing plants one partially owned and six natural gas treating plants with a combined daily inlet capacity in excess of billion cubic feet per day 
in addition to these natural gas assets  we own and operate three crude oil pipelines totaling approximately miles with a capacity of more than  barrels per day 
this includes our mountaineer crude oil pipeline in the

discovery s assets include a cryogenic natural gas processing plant near larose  louisiana  a natural gas liquids fractionator plant near paradis  louisiana and an offshore natural gas gathering and transportation system 
effective june   and due in part to our response to ferc order  management  operations and decision making control of certain regulated gathering assets in the midstream segment were transferred to the gas pipeline segment 
these assets are owned by transco  but prior to this change were commercially and physically operated by midstream 
we also requested and were granted a partial waiver allowing us to continue to manage and operate the discovery gas transmission and black marlin assets 
in order to comply with the remaining provisions of the ferc order  we determined it was necessary to transfer the management of our equity investment in the aux sable processing plant to power 
this transfer was effective september  gulf coast petrochemical and olefins we own a interest in and are the operator for an ethane cracker at geismar  louisiana  with a total production capacity of billion pounds per year of ethylene

this expansion involved the construction of a fourth cryogenic processing train at our existing gas plant in opal  wyoming 
this fourth train boosted opal s overall processing capacity from mmcf d to more than billion cubic feet per day  with the ability to recover in excess of mbbls d of ngl products 
originally  this fourth train was owned by willbros mt 
west  inc and revenues from the processing were shared with willbros 
we purchased this plant from willbros in january  and now operate only for our interests 
from the opal plant  gas can be delivered to markets throughout the west coast and in the rockies via connections to three interstate pipelines colorado interstate pipeline  kern river pipeline and our own northwest pipeline 
gathering and processing deepwater projects the deepwater gulf continues to be an attractive growth area for our midstream business 
investments like our alpine pipeline and devils tower production facilities continue to increase our fee based business and our scale in the gulf 
our floating production system and associated pipelines  devils tower  became operational on may  initially built to serve dominion exploration production s devils tower field  the floating production system is located in mississippi canyon block  approximately miles south southwest of mobile  alabama 
during the fourth quarter of  the platform s service expanded to include the triton and goldfinger fields in addition to the devils tower field 
located in  feet of water  it is the world s deepest dry tree spar 
the platform  which is operated by dominion on our behalf  is capable of producing mmcf d of natural gas and mbbls d of oil 
the devils tower project includes gas and oil pipelines 
the mile canyon chief gas pipeline consists of inch diameter pipe 
the mile mountaineer oil pipeline is a combination of and inch diameter 
table of contents pipe 
the gas is delivered into transco s pipeline  and processed at our mobile bay plant to recover the ngls 
the oil is transported to chevrontexaco s empire terminal in plaquemines parish  louisiana 
our inch oil pipeline  alpine  which became operational on december  is averaging approximately mbbls d for the fourth quarter of the pipeline extends miles from garden banks block in the central gulf of mexico to our shallow water platform at galveston area block a from this platform  the oil is delivered onshore through exxonmobil s hoover offshore oil pipeline system under a joint tariff agreement 
this production is coming from the gunnison field  which is located in  feet of water and operated by kerr mcgee oil gas corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of kerr mcgee corporation 
since  we have invested almost billion in new midstream assets in the gulf of mexico 
these facilities provide both onshore and offshore services through pipelines  platforms and processing plants 
the new facilities could also attract incremental gas volumes to transco s pipeline system in the southeastern united states 
customers and operations our domestic gas gathering and processing customers are generally natural gas producers who have proved and or producing natural gas fields in the areas surrounding our infrastructure 
during  these operations gathered and processed gas for approximately gas gathering customers and processing customers 
our top three gathering and processing customers accounted for about percent of our domestic gathering revenue and processing gross margin 
our gathering and processing agreements are generally long term agreements 
in addition to our gathering and processing operations  we also market ngls and petrochemical products to a wide range of users in the energy and petrochemical industries 
we provide these products to third parties from the production at our domestic facilities 
the majority of domestic sales are based on supply contracts of less than one year in duration 
the production from our canadian facilities is marketed in canada and in the united states 
our venezuelan assets were constructed and are currently operated for the exclusive benefit of pdvsa 
the significant contracts have a remaining term between and years and our revenues are based on a combination of fixed capital payments  throughput volumes  and  in the case of one of the gas compression facilities  a minimum throughput guarantee 
the political situation in venezuela has enjoyed relative calm since the defeat of the referendum to remove president hugo chavez from office 
however  president chavez has confirmed his public criticism of us policy and has implemented unilateral changes to existing energy related contracts  indicating that a level of political risk still remains

table of contents other at december   we owned approximately percent of longhorn  which owns a refined petroleum products pipeline from houston  texas to el paso  texas 
during february  we participated in a recapitalization plan completed by longhorn  following which our subsidiaries  longhorn enterprises of texas  inc leti and williams petroleum services  llc wps  together own  directly or indirectly  approximately percent of the class b interests in longhorn pipeline investors  llc pipeline investors and approximately percent of the common interests therein 
pipeline investors indirectly owns longhorn 
the recapitalization provided the funds necessary to complete final construction and start up of the pipeline 
as part of the recapitalization  leti sold a portion of its limited partner interests in longhorn for million  and leti and wps sold a portion of the debt owed to them individually by longhorn for approximately million 
in addition  in exchange for the common interests described above  leti contributed the remaining balance of its limited partnership interests  and wps contributed all of its general partnership interests in the general partner of longhorn 
leti and wps also exchanged the remaining debt owed by longhorn for the class b interests described above 
the class b interests are preferred interests but subordinate to the new investors preferred interests  and the common interests are subordinate to both 
during the first quarter of  longhorn became fully operational as deliveries commenced through both the odessa and el paso terminals 
however  the pipeline s throughput fell significantly short of management expectations 
the primary driver behind this volume shortfall was the narrowing of the refined product pricing differentials between the gulf coast and el paso markets 
during the second quarter of  longhorn management indicated the shortfall was likely to continue and that the original business model was no longer feasible 
a financial advisor was engaged to develop alternative economic options for the pipeline 
the three primary alternatives being considered were sale of the pipeline  conversion to alternative service  expansion to the phoenix tucson markets 
as a result of the other than temporary decline in fair value identified in the second quarter  we impaired the common interests by million and the class b shares by million 
after these adjustments  our book value of our investment in longhorn as of june  totaled million  comprised of million of common interests and million of class b shares 
during the third quarter of  we provided million of a million fully collateralized bridge loan to fund operations of longhorn until an economically feasible operational alternative was developed 
in the fourth quarter of  management of longhorn concluded that its preferred strategy was the sale of the longhorn assets 
accordingly  they directed the financial advisor to solicit offers from several entities 
the financial advisor is currently working to facilitate a transaction by the end of the second quarter after reviewing the terms and conditions of the bids  our management has determined a full impairment of our investment in the class b and common interests is appropriate 
this decision resulted in a december  write down of the remaining million in book value which had been further reduced by additional equity losses during the third and fourth quarters 
however  we expect to receive full payment on the million bridge loan from the proceeds of the sale 
additional business segment information our ongoing business segments are accounted for as continuing operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes to financial statements included in part ii 
operations related to certain assets in discontinued operations sold in and have been reclassified from their traditional business segment to discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes to financial statements included in part ii 
our corporate parent company performs certain management  legal  financial  tax  consultative  administrative and other services for our subsidiaries 

table of contents our principal sources of cash are from external financings  dividends and advances from our subsidiaries  investments  payments by subsidiaries for services rendered  interest payments from subsidiaries on cash advances and net proceeds from asset sales 
the amount of dividends available to us from subsidiaries largely depends upon each subsidiary s earnings and operating capital requirements 
the terms of many of our subsidiaries borrowing arrangements limit the transfer of funds to our corporate parent 
we believe that we have adequate sources and availability of raw materials and commodities for existing and anticipated business needs 
in support of our energy commodity activities  primarily conducted through power  we are required by counterparties to provide various forms of credit support such as margin  adequate assurance amounts and pre payments for gas supplies 
our pipeline systems are all regulated in various ways resulting in the financial return on the investments made in the systems being limited to standards permitted by the regulatory agencies 
each of the pipeline systems has ongoing capital requirements for efficiency and mandatory improvements  with expansion opportunities also necessitating periodic capital outlays 
regulatory matters power 
our power business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations at the local  state and federal levels  including regulation by the ferc and the commodity futures trading commission 
in addition  electricity and natural gas markets in california and elsewhere continue to be subject to numerous and wide ranging federal and state regulatory proceedings and investigations 
we are also subject to various federal and state actions and investigations regarding  among other things  market structure  behavior of market participants  market prices  and reporting to trade publications 
we may be liable for refunds and other damages and penalties as a result of ongoing actions and investigations 
the outcome of these matters could affect our creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual obligations as well as other market participants creditworthiness and ability to perform contractual obligations to us 
gas pipelines 
gas pipeline s interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the ferc under the natural gas act of nga and under the natural gas policy act of  and  as such  its rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  its accounting  and the extension  enlargement or abandonment of its jurisdictional facilities  among other things  are subject to regulation 
each gas pipeline company holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the ferc authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines  facilities and properties for which certificates are required under the nga 
each gas pipeline company is also subject to the natural gas pipeline safety act of  as amended  which regulates safety requirements in the design  construction  operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities 
ferc order standards of conduct for transmission providers governs how our interstate pipelines communicate and do business with their energy affiliates  power and exploration production 
one of the cornerstones of order is that interstate pipelines will not operate their pipeline systems to preferentially benefit their energy affiliates 
each of our interstate natural gas pipeline companies establishes its rates primarily through the ferc s ratemaking process 
key determinants in the ratemaking process are costs of providing service  including depreciation expense  allowed rate of return  including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes  volume throughput assumptions 
the allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case 
rate design and the allocation of costs between the demand and commodity rates also impact profitability 
as a result of these proceedings  certain revenues previously collected may be subject to refund 
exploration production 
our exploration production business is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations on taxation  the development  production and marketing of oil and gas  and environmental and safety matters 
many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells  rates of production  water discharge  prevention of waste and other matters 
such laws and regulations 
table of contents have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning our oil and gas wells and other facilities 
in addition  these laws and regulations  and any others that are passed by the jurisdictions where we have production  could limit the total number of wells drilled or the allowable production from successful wells  which could limit our reserves 
midstream 
for our midstream segment  onshore gathering is subject to regulation by states in which we operate and offshore gathering is subject to the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla 
of the states where midstream operates  currently only kansas and texas actively regulate gathering activities 
those states regulate gathering primarily through complaint mechanisms under which the state commission may resolve disputes involving an individual gathering arrangement 
although gathering facilities located offshore are not subject to the nga  some controversy exists as to how the ferc should determine whether offshore facilities function as gathering 
these issues are currently before the ferc 
most gathering facilities offshore are subject to the ocsla  which provides in part that outer continental shelf pipelines must provide open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and non owner shippers 
our remaining midstream canadian assets are regulated by the alberta energy utilities board aeub and alberta environment 
the regulatory system for the alberta oil and gas industry incorporates a large measure of self regulation  providing that licensed operators are held responsible for ensuring that their operations are conducted in accordance with all provincial regulatory requirements 
for situations in which non compliance with the applicable regulations is at issue  the aeub and alberta environment have implemented an enforcement process with escalating consequences 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our regulatory matters 
environmental matters our generation facilities  natural gas pipelines  and exploration and production operations are subject to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the state and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil  gas or other pollutants into the air  soil  or water  as well as liability for clean up costs 
materials could be released into the environment in several ways including  but not limited to from a well or drilling equipment at a drill site  leakage from gathering systems  pipelines  transportation facilities and storage tanks  damage to oil and gas wells resulting from accidents during normal operations  blowouts  cratering and explosions 
because the requirements imposed by environmental laws and regulations are frequently changed  we cannot assure you that laws and regulations enacted in the future  including changes to existing laws and regulations  will not adversely affect our business 
in addition  because we acquire properties that have been operated in the past by others  we may be liable for environmental damage caused by such former operators 
we believe compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
however  environmental laws and regulations could affect our business in various ways from time to time  including incurring capital and maintenance expenditures  imposing limitations on generation facility availability  fines and penalties  and creating the need to seek relief from the ferc for rate increases to recover the costs of certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses which we believe would be granted 
for a discussion of specific environmental issues  see environmental under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and environmental matters in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents competition power 
in our power segment  we compete directly with large independent energy marketers  marketing affiliates of regulated pipelines and utilities and natural gas producers 
we also compete with both brokerage houses and other energy based companies offering similar services 
since  we have fewer competitors due to the exit of independent energy marketers from the marketplace and the exit of utilities from financial merchant activities 
we anticipate more competition in the future from brokerage houses  which are increasing their trading activity 
gas pipeline 
our gas pipeline segment faces increased competition as a result of various actions taken by the ferc and several states in which we operate to strengthen market forces in the natural gas pipeline industry 
in a number of key markets  interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressures from other major pipeline systems  enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a supplier or switch suppliers based on the short term price of gas and the cost of transportation 
we expect competition for natural gas transportation to continue to intensify in future years due to increased customer access to other pipelines  rates  competitiveness among pipelines  customers desire to have more than one transporter  shorter contract terms  regulatory developments  and development of lng facilities particularly in our market areas 
future utilization of pipeline capacity will depend on competition from other pipelines and lng facilities  use of alternative fuels  the general level of natural gas demand  and weather conditions 
suppliers of natural gas are able to compete for any gas markets capable of being served by pipelines using nondiscriminatory transportation services provided by the pipeline companies 
as the regulated environment has matured  many pipeline companies have faced reduced levels of subscribed capacity as contractual terms expire and customers opt to reduce firm capacity under contract in favor of alternative sources of transmission and related services 
this situation  known in the industry as capacity turnback  is forcing the pipeline companies to evaluate the consequences of major demand reductions in traditional long term contracts 
it could also result in significant shifts in system utilization  and possible realignment of cost structure for remaining customers since all interstate natural gas pipeline companies continue to be authorized to charge maximum rates approved by the ferc on a cost of service basis 
gas pipeline does not anticipate any significant financial impact from capacity turnback 
we anticipate that we will be able to remarket most future capacity subject to future capacity turnback  although competition may cause some of the remarketed capacity to be sold at lower rates or for shorter terms 
exploration production 
our exploration production segment competes with other oil and gas concerns  including major and independent oil and gas companies in the development  production and marketing of natural gas 
we compete in areas such as acquisition of oil and gas properties and obtaining necessary equipment  supplies and services 
we also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled employees 
midstream 
in our midstream segment  we face regional competition with varying competitive factors in each basin 
our gathering and processing business competes with other midstream companies  interstate and intrastate pipelines  master limited partnerships mlp  producers and independent gatherers and processors 
we primarily compete with five to ten companies across all basins in which we provide services 
numerous factors impact any given customer s choice of a gathering or processing services provider  including rate  location  term  timeliness of well connections  pressure obligations and the willingness of the provider to process for either a fee or for liquids taken in kind 
we also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled employees 
in we formed williams partners to help compete against other master limited partnerships for midstream projects 
by virtue of the master limited partnership structure  williams partners provides us with an alternative and low cost source of capital 
we expect the alternative  low cost capital will allow it to compete with other mlps when pursuing acquisition opportunities of gathering and processing assets 
employees at february   we had approximately  full time employees including at the corporate level  at power   at gas pipeline  at exploration production  and at midstream 
none of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements

risk factors forward looking statements risk factors and cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of certain matters contained in this report  excluding historical information  include forward looking statements statements that discuss our expected future results based on current and pending business operations 
we make these forward looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor protections provided under the private securities litigation reform act of all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this report which address activities  events or developments that we expect  believe or anticipate will exist or may occur in the future  are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements can be identified by various forms of words such as anticipates  believes  could  may  should  continues  estimates  expects  forecasts  might  planned  potential  projects  scheduled or similar expressions 
these forward looking statements include  among others  statements regarding amounts and nature of future capital expenditures  expansion and growth of our business and operations  business strategy  estimates of proved gas and oil reserves  reserve potential  development drilling potential  cash flow from operations  seasonality of certain business segments  power and gas prices and demand 
forward looking statements are based on numerous assumptions  uncertainties and risks that could cause future events or results to be materially different from those stated or implied in this document 
some of these risks are described in the risk factors section of this report and one should keep in mind these risk factors when considering forward looking statements 
given the uncertainties and risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement  we caution investors not to unduly rely on our forward looking statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements to reflect future events or developments 
further  the information about our intentions contained or incorporated into this report represents our intention as of the date of this report and is based on  among other things  the existing regulatory environment  industry conditions  market conditions and prices  the economy in general and our assumptions as of such date 
we may change our intentions  at any time and without notice  based upon any changes in such factors  in our assumptions  or otherwise 

table of contents risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information in this report 
each of these factors could adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our securities 
risks inherent to our industry and business the long term financial condition of our natural gas transmission and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access  demand for those supplies in our traditional markets  and market demand for natural gas 
the development of additional natural gas reserves requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploration and development drilling and the installation of production  gathering  storage  transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our pipeline systems 
low prices for natural gas  regulatory limitations  or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development of additional reserves and production  gathering  storage and pipeline transmission and import and export of natural gas supplies 
additional natural gas reserves might not be developed in commercial quantities and in sufficient amounts to fill the capacities of our gathering  transmission and processing pipeline facilities 
additionally  in some cases  new lng import facilities built near our markets could result in less demand for our gathering and transmission facilities 
estimating reserves and future net revenues involves uncertainties and negative revisions to reserve estimates  and oil and gas price declines may lead to impairment of oil and gas assets 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
reserves that are proved reserves are those estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  but should not be considered as a guarantee of results for future drilling projects 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of developmental expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data included in this report represent estimates 
in addition  the estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and the present value of such estimates are based upon certain assumptions about future production levels  prices and costs that may not prove to be correct over time 
quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment 
lower oil and gas prices may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields  which reduces proved property reserve estimates 
if negative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves were to occur  it would have the effect of increasing the rates of depreciation  depletion and amortization on the affected properties  which would decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
the revisions may also be sufficient to trigger impairment losses on certain properties which would result in a further non cash charge to earnings 
the revisions could also possibly affect the evaluation of exploration production s goodwill for impairment purposes 

table of contents historic performance of our exploration and production business is no guarantee of future performance 
our success rate for drilling projects in should not be considered a predictor of future performance 
performance of our exploration and production business is affected in part by factors beyond our control  such as regulations and regulatory approvals  availability of capital for drilling projects which may be affected by other risk factors discussed in this report  cost effective availability of drilling rigs and necessary equipment  availability of cost effective transportation for products  market risks discussed in this report 
our drilling  production  gathering  processing and transporting activities involve numerous risks that might result in accidents and other operating risks and costs 
our operations are subject to all the risks and hazards typically associated with the development and exploration for  and the production and transportation of oil and gas 
these operating risks include  but are not limited to blowouts  cratering and explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  pollution and other environmental risks  natural disasters 
in addition  there are inherent in our gas gathering  processing and transporting properties a variety of hazards and operating risks  such as leaks  explosions and mechanical problems that could cause substantial financial losses 
in addition  these risks could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution  impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us 
in accordance with customary industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the location of pipelines near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks 
certain segments of our pipelines run through such areas 
in spite of our precautions  an event could cause considerable harm to people or property  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  particularly if the event is not fully covered by insurance 
accidents or other operating risks could further result in loss of service available to our customers 
such circumstances could adversely impact our ability to meet contractual obligations and retain customers 
costs of environmental liabilities and complying with existing and future environmental regulations could exceed our current expectations 
our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal  provincial  state and municipal laws and regulations 
such laws and regulations impose  among other things  restrictions  liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation  handling  use  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  in connection with spills  releases and emissions of various substances into the environment  and in connection with the operation  maintenance  abandonment and reclamation of our facilities 

table of contents compliance with environmental laws will require significant expenditures  including for clean up costs and damages arising out of contaminated properties 
the possible failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations that might result in the imposition of fines and penalties 
we are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our facilities and assets  whether acquired or developed  regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether they are known or unknown 
in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures  we could acquire  or be required to provide indemnification against  environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses  which may not be covered by insurance 
in addition  the steps we could be required to take to bring certain facilities into compliance could be prohibitively expensive  and we might be required to shut down  divest or alter the operation of those facilities  which might cause us to incur losses 
although we do not expect that the costs of complying with current environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental laws in the future will not have such an effect 
we make assumptions and develop expectations about possible expenditures related to environmental conditions based on current laws and regulations and current interpretations of those laws and regulations 
if the interpretation of laws or regulations  or the laws and regulations themselves  change  our assumptions may change 
our regulatory rate structure and our contracts with customers might not necessarily allow us to recover capital costs we incur to comply with the new environmental regulations 
also  we might not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for certain development projects 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them  the operation of our facilities could be prevented or become subject to additional costs  resulting in potentially material adverse consequences to our operations 
our operating results for certain segments of our business might fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
revenues from certain segments of our business  including gas transmission and the sale of electric power  can have seasonal characteristics 
in many parts of the country  demand for power peaks during the hot summer months  with market prices also peaking at that time 
in other areas  demand for power peaks during the winter 
in addition  demand for gas and other fuels peaks during the winter 
as a result  our overall operating results in the future might fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
demand for gas and other fuels could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the nature and location of our facilities and pipeline systems and the terms of our power sale agreements and gas transmission arrangements relative to demand created by unusual weather patterns 
additionally  changes in the price of natural gas could benefit one of our business units  but disadvantage another 
for example  our exploration production business may benefit from higher natural gas prices  and power  which uses gas as a fuel source  may not 
risks related to the current geopolitical situation our investments and projects located outside of the united states expose us to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  fluctuations in currency rates  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
these risks might delay or reduce our realization of value from our international projects 
we currently own and might acquire and or dispose of material energy related investments and projects outside the united states 
the economic and political conditions in certain countries where we have interests or in which we might explore development  acquisition or investment opportunities present risks of delays in construction and interruption of business  as well as risks of war  expropriation  nationalization  renegotiation  trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy  that are greater than in the united states 
the uncertainty of the legal environment in certain foreign countries in which we develop or acquire projects or make investments could make it more difficult to obtain non recourse project or other financing on suitable terms  could adversely affect the ability of certain customers to honor their obligations with respect to such projects or investments and could impair our ability to enforce our rights under agreements relating to such projects or investments 

table of contents operations in foreign countries also can present currency exchange rate and convertibility  inflation and repatriation risk 
in certain conditions under which we develop or acquire projects  or make investments  economic and monetary conditions and other factors could affect our ability to convert our earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
in addition  risk from fluctuations in currency exchange rates can arise when our foreign subsidiaries expend or borrow funds in one type of currency but receive revenue in another 
in such cases  an adverse change in exchange rates can reduce our ability to meet expenses  including debt service obligations 
foreign currency risk can also arise when the revenues received by our foreign subsidiaries are not in us dollars 
in such cases  a strengthening of the us dollar could reduce the amount of cash and income we receive from these foreign subsidiaries 
we have put contracts in place to mitigate our most significant foreign currency exchange risks 
we have some exposures that are not hedged which could result in losses or volatility in our earnings 
risks related to strategy and financing our debt agreements impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
certain of our debt agreements contain covenants that restrict or limit among other things  our ability to create liens  sell assets  make certain distributions  repurchase equity and incur additional debt 
in addition  our debt agreements contain  and those we enter into in the future may contain  financial covenants and other limitations with which we will need to comply 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by many events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that our future operating results will be sufficient to comply with the covenants or  in the event of a default under any of our debt agreements  to remedy that default 
our failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements and other related transactional documents could result in events of default 
upon the occurrence of such an event of default  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under a particular facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments  if any  to extend further credit 
an event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross default or cross acceleration of another debt agreement 
such a default or acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument 
if an event of default occurs  or if other debt agreements cross default  and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding to us  we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay amounts outstanding under such debt agreements 
developments affecting the wholesale power and energy trading industry sector have reduced market activity and liquidity and might continue to adversely affect our results of operations 
in  we announced our decision to maintain our wholesale power and energy trading business and trading portfolio 
therefore  the legacy issues arising out of the energy crisis in california  the resulting collapse in energy merchant credit and volatility in natural gas prices  the enron corporation bankruptcy filing  and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities and increased litigation related to such inquiries  could continue to affect us in the future 
these market factors have led to industry wide downturns that have resulted in some companies being forced to exit the energy trading markets leading to a reduction in the number of trading partners and market liquidity 
our lack of investment grade credit ratings increases our costs of doing business in many ways and increases our risks from market disruptions and further credit downgrades 
because we do not have an investment grade credit rating  our transactions in each of our businesses require greater credit assurances  both to be given from  and received by  us to satisfy credit support requirements 
in addition  we are more vulnerable to the impact of market disruptions or a further downgrade 
table of contents of our credit rating that might further increase our cost of borrowing or further impair our ability to access one or any of the capital markets 
such disruptions could include further economic downturns  deteriorating capital market conditions generally  declining market prices for electricity and natural gas  terrorist attacks or threatened attacks on our facilities or those of other energy companies  the overall health of the energy industry  including the bankruptcy or insolvency of other companies 
despite our restructuring efforts  we may not attain investment grade ratings 
credit rating agencies perform independent analysis when assigning credit ratings 
given the significant changes in capital markets and the energy industry over the last few years  credit rating agencies continue to review the criteria for attaining investment grade ratings and make changes to those criteria from time to time 
our goal is to attain investment grade ratios 
however  there is no guarantee that the credit rating agencies will assign us investment grade ratings even if we meet or exceed their criteria for investment grade ratios 
electricity  natural gas liquids and gas prices are volatile and this volatility could adversely affect our financial results  cash flows  access to capital and ability to maintain existing businesses 
our revenues  operating results  profitability  future rate of growth and the value of our power and gas businesses depend primarily upon the prices we receive for natural gas  electricity and other commodities 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
historically  the markets for these commodities have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
wide fluctuations in prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for these commodities  market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control  including worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for electricity  natural gas  petroleum  and related commodities  turmoil in the middle east and other producing regions  terrorist attacks on production or transportation assets  weather conditions  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of other types of fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  the price and level of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  volatility in the natural gas markets  the overall economic environment  the credit of participants in the markets where products are bought and sold 
we might not be able to successfully manage the risks associated with selling and marketing products in the wholesale energy markets 
our portfolios consist of wholesale contracts to buy and sell commodities  including contracts for electricity  natural gas  natural gas liquids and other commodities that are settled by the delivery of the 
table of contents commodity or cash throughout the united states 
if the values of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate or cannot manage  we could realize material losses from our marketing 
in the past  certain marketing and trading companies have experienced severe financial problems due to price volatility in the energy commodity markets 
in certain instances this volatility has caused companies to be unable to deliver energy commodities that they had guaranteed under contract 
in such event  we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts  if any  already paid to  or received from  counterparties 
in addition  in our businesses  we often extend credit to our counterparties 
despite performing credit analysis prior to extending credit  we are exposed to the risk that we might not be able to collect amounts owed to us 
if the counterparty to such a financing transaction fails to perform and any collateral that secures our counterparty s obligation is inadequate  we will lose money 
if we are unable to perform under our energy agreements  we could be required to pay damages 
these damages generally would be based on the difference between the market price to acquire replacement energy or energy services and the relevant contract price 
depending on price volatility in the wholesale energy markets  such damages could be significant 
risks related to regulations that affect our industry our gas sales  transmission  and storage operations are subject to government regulations and rate proceedings that could have an adverse impact on the profitability of these operations 
our interstate gas sales  transmission  and storage operations conducted through our gas pipelines business are subject to the ferc s rules and regulations in accordance with the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of the ferc s regulatory authority extends to transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce  rates and charges  construction  acquisition  extension or abandonment of services or facilities  accounts and records  depreciation and amortization policies  operating terms and conditions of service 
regulatory actions in these areas can affect our business in many ways  including decreasing tariff rates and revenues  decreasing volumes in our pipelines  increasing our costs and otherwise altering the profitability of our business 
the ferc has taken certain actions to strengthen market forces in the natural gas pipeline industry that have led to increased competition throughout the industry 
in a number of key markets  interstate pipelines are now facing competitive pressure from other major pipeline systems  enabling local distribution companies and end users to choose a transmission provider based on considerations other than location 
our revenues might decrease if we are unable to gain adequate  reliable and affordable access to transmission and distribution assets due to the ferc and regional regulation of wholesale market transactions for electricity and gas 
we depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver the electricity and natural gas we buy and sell in the wholesale market 
if transmission is disrupted  if capacity is inadequate  or if credit requirements or rates of such utilities or energy companies are increased  our ability to sell and deliver products might be hindered 
the ferc has issued power transmission regulations that require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open access  non discriminatory basis 
although these regulations are designed to encourage competition in wholesale market transactions for electricity  we believe that some companies may have failed to provide fair and equal access to 
table of contents their transmission systems or have not provided sufficient transmission capacity to enable other companies to transmit electric power 
we cannot predict whether and to what extent the industry will comply with these initiatives  or whether the regulations will fully accomplish the ferc s objectives 
in addition  the independent system operators who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets  such as california  have in the past been authorized to impose  and might continue to impose  price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets 
these types of price limitations and other mechanisms might adversely impact the profitability of our wholesale power marketing and trading 
given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long term price history in many of these markets and the imposition of price limitations by regulators  independent system operators or other marker operators  we can offer no assurance that we will be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets 
the different regional power markets in which we compete or will compete in the future have changing regulatory structures  which could affect our growth and performance in these regions 
our results are likely to be affected by differences in the market and transmission regulatory structures in various regional power markets 
problems or delays that might arise in the formation and operation of new regional transmission organizations rtos might restrict our ability to sell power produced by our generating capacity to certain markets if there is insufficient transmission capacity otherwise available 
the rules governing the various regional power markets might also change from time to time which could affect our costs or revenues 
because it remains unclear which companies will be participating in the various regional power markets  or how rtos will develop and evolve or what regions they will cover  we are unable to assess fully the impact that these power markets might have on our business 
our businesses are subject to complex government regulations 
the operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation 
existing regulations might be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations might be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in laws and regulations might have a detrimental effect on our business 
over the past few years  certain restructured energy markets have experienced supply problems and price volatility 
in some of these markets  including california  proposals have been made by governmental agencies and other interested parties to re regulate areas of these markets which have previously been deregulated 
various forms of market controls and limitations including price caps and bid caps have already been implemented and new controls and market restructuring proposals are in various stages of development  consideration and implementation 
we cannot assure you that changes in market structure and regulation will not adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that other proposals to re regulate will not be made or that legislative or other attention to the electric power restructuring process will not cause the deregulation process to be delayed or reversed 
the outcome of pending rate cases to set the rates we can charge customers on certain of our pipelines might result in rates that do not provide an adequate return on the capital we have invested in those pipelines 
we anticipate that in the next twelve months we will file rate cases with the ferc to request changes to the rates we charge on northwest pipeline and transco 
the outcome of those rate cases is uncertain 
there is a risk that rates set by the ferc will be lower than is necessary to provide us with an adequate return on the capital we have invested in these assets 
there is also the risk that higher rates will cause our customers to look for alternative ways to transport their natural gas 
legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations relating to the energy industry and capital markets have adversely affected our business and many continue to do so 
public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry and of the capital markets has resulted in increased regulation being either proposed or implemented 
such scrutiny has also resulted in various inquiries  investigations and court proceedings in which we are a named defendant 

table of contents such inquiries  investigations and court proceedings are ongoing and continue to adversely affect our business as a whole 
we might see these adverse effects continue as a result of the uncertainty of these ongoing inquiries and proceedings  or additional inquiries and proceedings by federal or state regulatory agencies or private plaintiffs 
in addition  we cannot predict the outcome of any of these inquiries or whether these inquiries will lead to additional legal proceedings against us  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other regulatory action  including legislation  which might be materially adverse to the operation of our business and our revenues and net income or increase our operating costs in other ways 
current legal proceedings or other matters against us arising out of our ongoing and discontinued operations including environmental matters  disputes over gas measurement  royalty payments  shareholder class action suits  regulatory appeals and similar matters might result in adverse decisions against us 
the result of such adverse decisions  either individually or in the aggregate  could be material and may not be covered fully or at all by insurance 
risks related to accounting standards potential changes in accounting standards might cause us to revise our financial results and disclosure in the future  which might change the way analysts measure our business or financial performance 
accounting irregularities discovered in the past few years in various industries have forced regulators and legislators to take a renewed look at accounting practices  financial disclosures  companies relationships with their independent auditors and retirement plan practices 
because it is still unclear what laws or regulations will ultimately develop  we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies or the energy industry or in our operations specifically 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb or the sec could enact new accounting standards that might impact how we are required to record revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
risks related to market volatility and risk management our reported results are subject to volatility around our use of derivatives that hedge the economic risk of our commodity exposures 
some derivatives do not qualify as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas and so changes in fair value are recorded to income 
during the period from to when our power business was for sale  most changes in the fair value of derivatives used in our power business were recorded to income as net forward unrealized mark to market gains 
in future periods  the cash associated with those hedges could be realized but the value will have already been recorded in income 
our risk measurement and hedging activities might not prevent losses 
we manage our commodity price risk for our unregulated businesses as a whole 
although we have risk measurement systems in place that use various methodologies to quantify risk  these systems might not always be followed or might not always work as planned 
further  such risk measurement systems do not in themselves manage risk  and adverse changes in energy commodity market prices  volatility  adverse correlation of commodity prices  the liquidity of markets  and changes in interest rates might still adversely affect our earnings and cash flows and our balance sheet under applicable accounting rules  even if risks have been identified 
in an effort to manage our financial exposure related to commodity price and market fluctuations  we have entered into contracts to hedge certain risks associated with our assets and operations  including our long term tolling agreements 
in these hedging activities  we have used fixed price  forward  physical purchase and sales contracts  futures  financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges  as well as long term structured transactions when feasible 
nevertheless  no single hedging arrangement can adequately address all risks present in a given contract 
for example  a forward contract that would be effective in hedging commodity price volatility risks would not hedge the tolling contract s counterparty credit or performance risk 
therefore  unhedged risks will always continue to exist 
while we attempt to manage counterparty credit risk within guidelines established by our credit policy  we may not be 
table of contents able to successfully manage all credit risk and as such  future cash flows could be impacted by counterparty default 
the impact of changes in market prices for natural gas on the average gas prices received by us may be reduced based on the level of our hedging strategies 
these hedging arrangements may limit our potential gains if the market prices for natural gas were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which production is less than expected  a change in the difference between published price indexes established by pipelines in which our hedged production is delivered and the reference price established in the hedging arrangements is such that we are required to make payments to our counterparties  the counterparties to our hedging arrangements fail to honor their financial commitments 
risks related to employees  outsourcing of non core support activities institutional knowledge residing with current employees or our former employees now employed by our outsourcing service providers might not be adequately preserved 
in certain segments of our business  institutional knowledge resides with employees who have many years of service 
as these employees reach retirement age  we may not be able to replace them with employees of comparable knowledge and experience 
other qualified individuals could leave us or refuse our offers of employment if our recruiting and retention efforts are unsuccessful 
our efforts at knowledge transfer could be inadequate 
due to the large number of our former employees who were migrated to an outsourcing provider in  access to significant amounts of internal historical knowledge and expertise could become unavailable to us  particularly if knowledge transfer initiatives are delayed or ineffective 
failure of the outsourcing relationships might negatively impact our ability to conduct our business 
some studies indicate a high failure rate of outsourcing relationships 
although we have taken steps to build a cooperative and mutually beneficial relationship with our outsourcing providers  a failure of all or part of these relationships could lead to loss of institutional knowledge and interruption of services necessary for us to be able to conduct our business 
our ability to receive services from outsourcing provider locations outside of the united states might be impacted by cultural differences  political instability  or unanticipated regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the united states 
certain accounting  information technology application development  human resources  and helpdesk services that are currently provided by our outsourcing provider were relocated to service centers outside of the united states during the economic and political conditions in certain countries from which our outsourcing providers may provide services to us present similar risks of business operations located outside of the united states previously discussed  including risks of interruption of business  war  expropriation  nationalization  renegotiation  trade sanctions or nullification of existing contracts and changes in law or tax policy  that are greater than in the united states 
risks related to weather  other natural phenomena and business disruption our assets and operations can be affected by weather and other natural phenomena 
our assets and operations  especially those located offshore  can be adversely affected by hurricanes  earthquakes  tornadoes and other natural phenomena and weather conditions including extreme temperatures  making it more difficult for us to realize the historic rates of return associated with these assets and operations 

table of contents our current information technology infrastructure is aging and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
limited capital spending for information technology infrastructure during resulted in an aging server environment that may not be adequate for our current business needs 
while efforts are ongoing to update the environment  the current age and condition of equipment could result in loss of internal and external communications  loss of data  inability to access data when needed  excessive software downtime including downtime for critical software applications  and other disruptions that could have a material adverse impact on our business

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are primarily a natural gas company  engaged in finding  producing  gathering  processing  and transporting natural gas 
we also manage a wholesale power business 
our operations are located principally in the united states and are organized into the following reporting segments power  gas pipeline  exploration production  and midstream gas liquids see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of reporting segments 
unless indicated otherwise  the following discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates  discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition and liquidity relates to our current continuing operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii item of this document 
overview of we entered having completed the key components of our restructuring plan and in a position to shift our focus to growth 
our plan included the following objectives increase focus and disciplined eva based investment in natural gas businesses eva economic value added is a registered trademark of stern stewart co  continue to steadily improve credit ratios and ratings with the goal of achieving investment grade ratios  continue to reduce risk and liquidity requirements while maximizing cash flow in the power segment  maintain liquidity from cash and revolving credit facilities of at least billion  generate sustainable growth in eva and shareholder value 
our income from continuing operations increased to million  as compared to million in our results reflect the benefit of increased natural gas production and higher net realized average prices  along with reduced levels of interest expense 
results for included million in costs associated with the early retirement of debt  while results for were reduced by accruals associated with agreements to resolve gas reporting issues and impairments of certain investments 
our net cash provided by operating activities was billion in  comparable with the level of billion 
in addition to achieving these results  the following represent significant actions or events that occurred during the year in  we further improved our credit ratios from those achieved in we retired million of debt that matured january  on february  the holders of the remaining million equity forward contracts associated with the feline pacs units exercised contracts to purchase one share of our common stock for a share  resulting in cash proceeds of approximately million 
the remaining notes associated with the feline pacs units totaling approximately million are due february  during  exploration production increased its average daily domestic production levels  its net realized average prices  and its developmental drilling activities 
in march  exploration production entered into a lease for ten new drilling rigs to support the accelerated pace of natural gas 
table of contents development in the piceance basin 
the first rig was delivered in january and the remaining rigs are expected to be delivered during in and early  power continued to reduce risk by entering into electricity and capacity forward contracts with fixed sales prices for over  megawatts of capacity in total across various periods through during  midstream gas liquids midstream continued efforts to expand operations of large scale assets in growth basins 
these efforts include signing definitive agreements to extend oil and gas pipelines from our devils tower spar to the blind faith prospect and obtaining board approval to add a fifth cryogenic train to our gas processing plant in opal  wyoming 
both of these additions are expected to be in service in in july and november of  our board of directors approved regular quarterly dividends of cents per share of common stock  which reflects an increase of percent compared with the cents per share paid in each of the three prior quarters 
on august   williams partners lp completed its initial public offering of five million common units at a price of per unit 
the underwriters also fully exercised their option to purchase an additional  common units at the same price 
upon completion of the transaction  we held approximately percent of the interests in williams partners lp  including percent of the general partner 
see the midstream gas liquids overview of within item for further information 
during third quarter  certain gulf coast area operations were interrupted by hurricanes 
the impact of these hurricanes included temporary shutdowns as well as varying levels of damage 
the overall impact was not material to our financial position 
in september  we reached an agreement to settle litigation filed in under the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the settlement  which received final approval in november  provided for us to pay million to plaintiffs  of which million was covered and paid by insurance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
in september  we increased our available liquidity by obtaining a total of million of capacity in two five year unsecured credit facilities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
in november  we initiated an offer to induce conversion of up to million of the percent junior subordinated debentures convertible into our common stock 
the conversion was executed in january and approximately million of the debentures were exchanged for common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
during we continued our efforts to resolve legacy issues  such as pending claims and investigations involving inaccurate reporting of natural gas prices and volumes to an industry publication in in february  we reached agreements with various parties to substantially resolve this exposure 
under the terms of these agreements  power will pay a total of million to the various parties 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
outlook for our plan for is focused on continued disciplined growth 
objectives of this plan include continue to improve both eva and segment profit 
invest in our natural gas businesses in a way that improves eva  meets customer needs  and enhances our competitive position 

table of contents continue to increase natural gas production 
increase the scale of our gathering and processing business in key growth basins 
file new rates to enable our gas pipeline segment to remain competitive and value creating  while managing our costs and capturing demand growth 
these rates are expected to be effective in execute power contracts that offset a significant percentage of our financial obligations associated with our tolling agreements 
as a result of the strategy to grow our natural gas businesses  we estimate capital expenditures will increase to approximately to billion in  compared to billion in we expect to fund capital and investment expenditures  debt payments  dividends and working capital requirements through cash generated from operations  which is currently estimated to be between billion and billion in  as well as proceeds from debt issuances  sales of units of williams partners lp  and cash and cash equivalents on hand as needed 
potential risks and or obstacles that could prevent us from achieving these objectives include volatility of commodity prices  lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations  decreased drilling success at exploration production  exposure associated with our efforts to resolve regulatory and litigation issues see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  general economic and industry downturn 
we continue to address these risks through utilization of commodity hedging strategies  focused efforts to resolve regulatory issues and litigation claims  disciplined investment strategies  and maintaining our desired level of at least billion in liquidity from cash and revolving credit facilities 
new accounting standards and emerging issues accounting standards that have been issued and are not yet effective  or that have not yet been issued  may have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the future 
these include revised sfas no 
 share based payment  proposed sfas on fair value measurements exposure draft  proposed interpretation on accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement no 
exposure draft  accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits preliminary views 
see recent accounting standards in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on these and other recently issued accounting standards 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates that require subjective and complex judgment 
the selection of these policies has been discussed with our audit committee 
we believe that the following are the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition derivatives we hold a substantial portfolio of energy trading and non trading contracts for a variety of purposes 
we review these contracts to determine whether they are non derivatives or derivatives 
if they are derivatives  we further assess whether the contracts qualify for either cash flow hedge accounting or the normal purchases and normal sales exception 
the determination of whether a derivative contract qualifies as a cash flow hedge includes an analysis of historical market price information to assess whether the derivatives are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk 
for derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges  changes in their fair value are not reflected in earnings until the associated hedged item affects earnings 
for those that have not been designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting  the net change in their fair value is recognized in income currently marked to market 
derivatives for which the normal purchases and normal sales exception has been elected are accounted for on an accrual basis 
the fair value for derivative contracts is determined based on the nature of the transaction and the market in which transactions are executed 
we also incorporate assumptions and judgments about counterparty performance and credit considerations in our determination of their fair value 
contracts are executed in the following environments exchange traded or over the counter markets with quoted prices  exchange traded or over the counter markets with quoted market prices but limited price transparency  requiring increased judgment to determine fair value  markets without quoted market prices 
the number of transactions executed without quoted market prices is limited 
we estimate the fair value of these contracts by using readily available price quotes in similar markets and other market analyses 
the fair value of all derivative contracts is continually subject to change as the underlying commodity market changes and our assumptions and judgments change 
additional discussion of the accounting for energy contracts at fair value is included in energy trading activities within item  item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas producing activities we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
estimated natural gas and oil reserves and forward market prices for oil and gas are a significant part of our financial calculations and certain estimated reserves are used as collateral to secure financing 
following are examples of how these estimates affect financial results an increase decrease in estimated proved oil and gas reserves can reduce increase our unit of production depreciation  depletion and amortization rates 
changes in oil and gas reserves and forward market prices both impact projected future cash flows from our oil and gas properties 
this  in turn  can impact our periodic impairment analyses  including that for goodwill 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant judgment in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering  and economic data 
after being estimated internally  percent of our reserve estimates are either audited or prepared by independent experts 
the data may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history  and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates could occur from time to time 
a revision of our reserve estimates within reasonably likely parameters is not expected to result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties or goodwill 
however  reserve estimate revisions would impact our depreciation and depletion expense prospectively 
for example  a change of approximately percent in oil and gas reserves for each basin would change our annual depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
table of contents between approximately million and million 
the actual impact would depend on the specific basins impacted and whether the change resulted from proved developed  proved undeveloped or a combination of these reserve categories 
forward market prices  which are utilized in our impairment analyses  include estimates of prices for periods that extend beyond those with quoted market prices 
this forward market price information is consistent with that generally used in evaluating our drilling decisions and acquisition plans 
these market prices for future periods impact the production economics underlying oil and gas reserve estimates 
the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period  thus impacting our estimates 
an unfavorable change in the forward price curve within reasonably likely parameters is not expected to result in an impairment of our oil and gas properties or goodwill 
contingent liabilities we record liabilities for estimated loss contingencies  including environmental matters  when we assess that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which new or different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect the previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
liabilities for contingent losses are based upon our assumptions and estimates and upon advice of legal counsel  engineers  or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter 
as new developments occur or more information becomes available  our assumptions and estimates of these liabilities may change 
changes in our assumptions and estimates or outcomes different from our current assumptions and estimates could materially affect future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
valuation of deferred tax assets and tax contingencies we have deferred tax assets resulting from certain investments and businesses that have a tax basis in excess of the book basis and from tax carry forwards generated in the current and prior years 
we must evaluate whether we will ultimately realize these tax benefits and establish a valuation allowance for those that may not be realizable 
this evaluation considers tax planning strategies  including assumptions about the availability and character of future taxable income 
at december   we have million of deferred tax assets for which a million valuation allowance has been established 
when assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered forecasts of future company performance  the estimated impact of potential asset dispositions and our ability and intent to execute tax planning strategies to utilize tax carryovers 
based on our projections  we believe that it is probable that we can utilize our year end federal tax net operating loss carryovers and capital loss carryovers prior to their expiration 
we are not expecting to be able to utilize million  or approximately million of tax benefit  of the charitable contribution carryovers expiring in the remaining million of charitable contributions are expected to be utilized prior to their expiration 
we also do not expect to be able to utilize million of foreign deferred tax assets related to carryovers 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the tax carryovers 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be materially different from those recorded  as influenced by potential changes in jurisdictional income tax laws and the circumstances surrounding the actual realization of related tax assets 
we regularly face challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the liability associated with our various filing positions  we record a liability for probable tax contingencies 
the ultimate disposition of these contingencies could have a material impact on net cash flows 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or were required to pay amounts in excess of our accrued liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and investments we evaluate our long lived assets and investments for impairment when we believe events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of certain long lived assets or the decline in carrying value of an investment is other than temporary 
in addition to those long lived assets and investments for which impairment charges were recorded see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements  certain others were reviewed for which no impairment was required 
our computations utilized judgments and assumptions in the following areas the probability that we would sell an asset or continue to hold and use it  for assets held for use  estimated fair value of the asset  undiscounted future cash flows  and discounted future cash flows  for assets held for sale  estimated sales proceeds  form and timing of the asset disposition  and counterparty performance considerations  for investments that may be impaired  whether the potential impairment is other than temporary  current and future economic environment in which the asset operates 
canadian olefins we continue to assess our canadian olefins assets for impairment based on previously identified indicators 
our investment in these assets is currently not estimated to be recoverable without modifications to or a renegotiation of key terms in an off gas processing agreement 
we have performed recoverability tests that considered varying outcomes relating to successful renegotiation of the processing agreements 
our computations used judgments and assumptions in the following areas varying terms of renegotiated contracts  commodity pricing  probability weighting of different scenarios  trends in foreign exchange rates 
after applying probability weightings to the various scenarios  we determined that the assets did not require impairment at december  and a critical assumption in our impairment analysis was the valuation of future contract terms in the related processing agreement 
unsuccessful renegotiation of the contract or a decrease of approximately percent or more in our low case contract valuation estimate would likely result in an impairment 
aux sable we own a percent equity interest in aux sable liquid products lp aux sable  which owns and operates a natural gas liquids extraction and fractionation facility 
during  we performed an impairment review of our investment in aux sable as operating results and cash flow projections suggested that a decline in the fair value of this investment below our carrying value could exist 
we estimated the fair value of our investment based on a projection of discounted cash flows of aux sable 
based upon our analysis  we recorded a million impairment of this investment 
during  we decided to pursue a potential sale of this investment 
we have recorded an impairment of million based on our estimate of sales proceeds from this investment 
pension and postretirement obligations we have employee benefit plans that include pension and other postretirement benefits 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense and obligations are calculated by a third party actuary and are impacted by various estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include the expected long 
table of contents term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  expected rate of compensation increase  health care cost trend rates  and employee demographics  including retirement age and mortality 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and adjustments are made as needed 
the assumptions utilized to compute expense and the benefit obligations are shown in note of notes to consolidated financial statements

benefit expense benefit obligation one percentage one percentage one percentage one percentage point increase point decrease point increase point decrease millions pension benefits discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase other postretirement benefits discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumed health care cost trend rate the expected long term rates of return on plan assets are determined by combining a review of historical returns realized within the portfolio  the investment strategy included in the plans investment policy statement  and the capital market projections provided by our independent investment consultant for the asset classifications in which the portfolio is invested as well as the target weightings of each asset classification 
these rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions  but because they are long term in nature  short term market swings do not significantly impact the rates 
changes to our target asset allocation would also impact these rates 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets used for our pension plans has been percent since over the past ten years  our actual average return on plan assets for our pension plans has been approximately percent 
the discount rates are used to discount future benefit obligations to today s dollars 
decreases in these rates increase the obligation and related expense 
the discount rates for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans were determined separately based on an approach specific to our plans and their respective expected benefit cash flows as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long term  high quality corporate bonds 
the expected rate of compensation increase represents average long term salary increases 
an increase in this rate causes pension obligation and expense to increase 
the assumed health care cost trend rates are based on our actual historical cost rates that are adjusted for expected changes in the health care industry

our management currently evaluates performance based on segment profit loss from operations see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior period amounts have been restated to reflect all segment changes 
the following discussions relate to the results of operations of our segments 
power overview of power s comparative operating results in were significantly influenced by the effect of cash flow hedge accounting and increased average natural gas and power prices 
in fourth quarter  power designated a portion of its power and natural gas derivative contracts as cash flow hedges 
as such  we deferred recognition of certain unrealized mark to market gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss in similar unrealized gains were recorded to earnings in and prior to the application of hedge accounting 
power s earnings do reflect unrealized mark to market gains from net increases in the fair value of forward derivative contracts held for trading purposes or which did not qualify for hedge accounting  and hedge ineffectiveness 
power s results also reflect the combined impact of increased natural gas and power prices on its nonderivative tolling contracts 
although the average price of power increased  there was a greater increase in the average purchase price of natural gas  which is used to produce power 
hurricane katrina and mild weather in california affected the prices of natural gas and power 
the narrowing of the margin between power and natural gas prices and an outage at an electric generation facility resulted in an accrual gross margin loss realized costs in excess of realized revenue on certain tolling contracts 
the chart below illustrates the impact of the unrealized mark to market gain and accrual gross margin loss on power s total gross margin revenue less cost of sales 
the below chart does not reflect  however  cash flows that power realized in from hedges for which mark to market gains or losses had been previously recognized 
in  power had positive cash flows from operations 
in addition to these declining margins  significant accruals for litigation contingencies  which were substantially resolved in  and an impairment of an equity investment further adversely impacted power s results 
graph 
table of contents in  power continued to focus on its objectives of minimizing financial risk  maximizing cash flow  meeting contractual commitments  executing new contracts to hedge its portfolio and providing functions that support our natural gas businesses 
key factors that may influence power s financial condition and operating performance include prices of power and natural gas  including changes in the margin between power and natural gas prices  changes in power and natural gas price volatility  changes in power and natural gas supply and demand  changes in the regulatory environment  the inability of counterparties to perform under contractual obligations due to their own credit constraints  changes in interest rates  changes in market liquidity  including changes in the ability to effectively hedge the portfolio 
outlook for for  power intends to service its customers needs while increasing the certainty of cash flows from its long term tolling contracts by executing new long term electricity and capacity sales contracts 
in and early  power entered into electricity and capacity forward contracts with fixed sales prices for over  megawatts of capacity in total across various periods through most of these contracts are treated on an accrual basis as either operating subleases or normal sales contracts under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
as power continues to apply hedge accounting in  its future earnings may be less volatile 
however  not all of power s derivative contracts qualify for hedge accounting 
because the derivative contracts qualifying for hedge accounting were previously marked to market through earnings prior to their being designated as cash flow hedges  the amounts recognized in future earnings under hedge accounting will not necessarily align with the expected cash flows to be realized from the settlement of those derivatives 
for example  to the extent that future earnings reflect losses from underlying transactions  such as natural gas purchases and power sales associated with tolling transactions  that have been hedged by the derivatives  the corresponding offsetting gains from the hedges have already been recognized in prior periods under mark to market accounting 
however  cash flows from power s portfolio continue to reflect the net amount from both the hedged transactions and the hedges 
even with the adoption of hedge accounting  power s earnings will continue to reflect mark to market volatility from unrealized gains and losses resulting from market movements of commodity based derivatives that are held for trading purposes  market movements of commodity based derivatives that represent economic hedges but which do not qualify for hedge accounting  ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges  primarily caused by locational differences between the hedging derivative and the hedged item or changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties 
the fair value of power s tolling  full requirements  transportation  storage and transmission contracts is not reflected in the balance sheet since these contracts are not derivatives 
some of these contracts have a significant negative estimated fair value and could also result in future operating profits or losses as a result of the volatile nature of energy commodity markets 
the inability of counterparties to perform under contractual obligations due to their own credit constraints could also affect future results 

table of contents year over year results years ended december  millions realized revenues net forward unrealized mark to market gains segment revenues cost of sales gross margin operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses other income expense net segment profit loss vs 
the million decrease in revenues includes a million decrease in realized revenues and a million decrease in net forward unrealized mark to market gains 
realized revenues represent revenue from the sale of commodities or completion of energy related services  and gains and losses from the net financial settlement of derivative contracts 
the million decrease in realized revenues is primarily due to the absence in of million in crude and refined products realized revenues  partially offset by a million increase in power and natural gas realized revenues 
the absence of crude and refined products revenues is due to the sale of the refined products business in power and natural gas realized revenues increased primarily due to a percent increase in average natural gas sales prices and a percent increase in average power sales prices 
hurricane katrina  among other factors  contributed to the increase in prices 
a percent decrease in power sales volumes partially offsets the increase in prices 
power sales volumes decreased because power did not replace certain long term physical contracts that expired or were terminated and because of mild weather in california  which resulted in lower demand 
net forward unrealized mark to market gains and losses represent changes in the fair values of certain derivative contracts with a future settlement or delivery date that have not been designated as cash flow hedges and the impact of the ineffectiveness of cash flow hedges 
the million decrease in net forward unrealized mark to market gains is primarily due to a million decrease associated with power and gas derivative contracts  partially offset by the absence in of a million unrealized loss on the interest rate portfolio in the decrease in power and gas unrealized mark to market gains primarily results from the impact of cash flow hedge accounting  which was prospectively applied to certain of power s derivative contracts beginning october  net unrealized gains of million related to the effective portion of the hedges are reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in compared to million in if power had not applied cash flow hedge accounting in  we would have reported the million in revenues instead of in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
also in  power recognized losses of million representing a correction of unrealized losses associated with a prior year 
our management concluded that the effects of this correction are not material to prior periods  results  or our trend of earnings 
partially offsetting these decreases is the effect of a greater increase in forward power prices on a greater volume of power purchase contracts in compared to  resulting in increased unrealized mark to market gains on net power derivatives that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 

table of contents the absence in of the unrealized loss on the interest rate portfolio is due to the termination and liquidation of all remaining interest rate derivatives in fourth quarter a decrease in forward interest rates caused unrealized losses in the interest rate portfolio in the million increase in power s cost of sales is primarily due to an increase in power and natural gas costs of million  partially offset by a decrease in crude and refined products costs of million

other income expense net in includes million in fees related to the sale of certain receivables to a third party 
although increased gas prices favorably impacted the fair value of power s derivative natural gas hedges  the million change from a segment profit to a segment loss is primarily due to the impact of cash flow hedge accounting 
additionally  plant outages and depressed margin spreads between the cost of gas and sales price of electricity contributed to lower segment profit 
accruals in for litigation contingencies and an impairment of an equity investment also contribute to the change in segment profit loss 
partially offsetting the decrease in segment profit is the absence in of unrealized and realized losses from the interest rate portfolio  which was liquidated in the fourth quarter of vs 
the billion decrease in revenues includes an approximately billion decrease in realized revenues partially offset by a million increase in net forward unrealized mark to market gains 
the approximately billion decrease in realized revenues is primarily due to an approximately billion decrease in power and natural gas realized revenues and an million decrease in crude and refined products realized revenues 
power and natural gas realized revenues decreased primarily due to a percent decrease in power sales volumes  partially offset by a percent increase in power sales prices 
sales volumes decreased because power did not replace certain long term physical contracts that expired or were terminated in  primarily due to a lack of market liquidity and past efforts to reduce our commitment to the power business

in  power had net forward unrealized mark to market gains of million  an increase of million from the increase in unrealized gains is due to a million increase associated with power and gas contracts  partially offset by an million decrease in crude and refined products and a million decrease in the interest rate portfolio 
the increase in power and gas primarily results from a greater increase associated with near term natural gas forward prices in than in also contributing to the increase was the absence in of unrealized losses of approximately million recognized in first quarter on contracts for which we elected the normal purchases and sales exception in second quarter another factor contributing to the increase was the impact of cash flow hedge accounting  which was prospectively applied to certain of power s forecasted transactions beginning october  a net loss of million related to the effective portion of the hedges was reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the decrease in crude and refined products primarily results from the sale of the crude gathering business in  the sale of the refined products business in and the past efforts to exit this line of business 
these activities led to a significantly smaller derivative position in than in which resulted in lower unrealized mark to market gains 
the decrease in the interest rate portfolio is due primarily to a decrease in forward interest rates in first quarter compared to a slight increase in first quarter the billion decrease in power s cost of sales is primarily due to a decrease in power and natural gas costs of approximately billion and a decrease in crude and refined products costs of million 
power and natural gas costs decreased primarily due to a percent decrease in power purchase volumes  partially offset by a percent increase in power prices 
a million reduction to certain contingent loss accruals in and a million loss for other contingencies in  both associated with power marketing activities in california during and  contributed to the decrease in costs discussed above 
costs in also reflect a million payment made to terminate a nonderivative power sales contract  which partially offsets the decrease in power and natural gas costs 
crude and refined products costs decreased primarily due to the sale of the crude gathering business in  the sale of the refined products business in  and other past efforts to exit this line of business 
the million decrease in sg a expenses is largely due to a million decline in compensation expense  primarily as a result of staff reductions in prior years combined with the accelerated recognition of million in of certain deferred compensation arrangements 
in addition  a million reduction of allowance for bad debts resulting from the settlement with certain california utilities and the absence of a million bad debt charge associated with a termination settlement in also contributed to the decrease

gas pipeline overview we operate  through our northwest pipeline and transco subsidiaries  approximately  miles of pipeline from the gulf coast to the northeast united states and from northern new mexico to the pacific northwest with a total annual throughput of approximately  trillion btus 
additionally  we hold a percent interest in gulfstream natural gas system  llc gulfstream 
this asset  which extends from the mobile bay area in alabama to markets in florida  has current transportation capacity of billion cubic feet per day 
our strategy to create value for our shareholders focuses on maximizing the utilization of our pipeline capacity by providing high quality  low cost transportation of natural gas to large and growing markets 
gas pipeline s interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to regulation by the ferc and as such  our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  and the extension  expansion or abandonment of jurisdictional facilities and accounting  among other things  are subject to regulation 
the rates are established through the ferc s ratemaking process 
changes in commodity prices and volumes transported have little impact on revenues because the majority of cost of service is recovered through firm capacity reservation charges in transportation rates 
significant events of grays harbor effective january  duke energy trading and marketing  llc duke terminated its firm transportation agreement related to northwest pipeline s grays harbor lateral 
in january  duke paid northwest pipeline million for the remaining book value of the asset and the related income taxes 
we and duke have not agreed on the amount of the income taxes due northwest pipeline as a result of the contract termination 
we have deferred the million difference between the proceeds and net book value of the lateral pending resolution of the disputed early termination obligation

the capacity has been fully subscribed by a single shipper for a twenty year term 
significant adjustments operating results for the year include adjustments of million were recorded  reflected as a million reduction of costs and operating expenses and a million reduction of sg a expenses 
these cost reductions were corrections of the carrying value of certain liabilities that were recorded in prior periods 
based on a review by management  these liabilities were no longer required 
pension expense was reduced by million in the second quarter of to reflect the cumulative impact of a correction of an error attributable to and the error was associated with our third party actuarial computation of annual net periodic pension expense and resulted from the identification of errors in certain transco participant data involving annuity contract information utilized for and adjustments of million reflected as increases in costs and operating expenses related to million of prior period accounting and valuation corrections for certain inventory items and an accrual of million for contingent refund obligations 
our management concluded that the effects of these adjustments are not material to our consolidated results for or prior periods  or to our trend of earnings 
outlook for filing of rate cases during  we will be focused on successfully filing rate cases for both transco and northwest pipeline subsidiaries which are expected to result in new transportation and storage rates beginning in ferc order accounting for pipeline assessment cost ferc order accounting for pipeline assessment costs  effective january   requires ferc regulated companies to expense certain pipeline integrity related assessment costs that we have historically capitalized

the increase in hedge losses was primarily due to higher market prices associated with our nymex collars and fixed hedge positions 
significant events of in march  we entered into a contract for the operation of ten new drilling rigs  each for a lease term of three years 
this arrangement supports our plan to accelerate the pace of natural gas development in the piceance basin through both deployment of the additional rigs and also as a result of the drilling and operational efficiencies the new rigs are designed to deliver 
we received our first two rigs in january and february  and they have begun drilling 
although we originally expected to deploy one new rig per month beginning in november  delays occurred as construction was impacted by the hurricanes experienced in the gulf 
during the second quarter of  we acquired an acreage position with a few producing wells in the fort worth basin in north central texas 
in early january  we increased our position in this basin 
our entry into this basin allows us to own an operated position that has potential for significant growth 
it increases our diversification into the mid continent region and allows us to use our horizontal drilling expertise to develop wells in the barnett shale formation

also contributing to the increase is a million increase in revenues from gas management activities and million increased production revenues from our international operations 
partially offsetting these increases is a million loss due to hedge ineffectiveness 
the increase in domestic production revenues primarily results from million higher revenues associated with a percent increase in net realized average prices for production sold as well as a million increase associated with an percent increase in average daily production volumes 
the higher net realized average prices reflect the benefit of the lower volumes hedged in as compared to coupled with higher market prices for natural gas 
the increase in production volumes primarily reflects an increase in the number of producing wells resulting from our successful drilling program

midstream gas liquids overview of in  midstream s ongoing strategy was to safely and reliably operate large scale midstream infrastructure where our assets can be fully utilized and drive low per unit costs 
our business is focused on consistently attracting new volumes to our assets by providing highly reliable service to our customers 
the following factors influenced our business in formation of williams partners lp in february  we formed williams partners lp  a limited partnership  to complement our business strategy by providing access to a lower cost of capital to further expand the scale of our operations 
on august   we completed our initial public offering ipo of five million common units of williams partners lp at a price of per unit

impact of hurricanes hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita caused temporary shut downs of most of our facilities and our producers facilities in the gulf coast region  which reduced product flows resulting in lower segment profit of an estimated million  which includes our insured property damage deductible  in the second half of our major facilities resumed normal operations shortly after the passage of each hurricane except for our devils tower spar and cameron meadows gas processing plant 
the devils tower deepwater spar was shut in on august   due to hurricane katrina and returned to service in early november 
the cameron meadows natural gas processing plant near johnson bayou  louisiana sustained significant damage from 
table of contents hurricane rita on september  the plant returned to limited service in february we are pursuing a business interruption claim with our insurance carrier but have not recognized any amounts related to this pending claim 
expansion efforts in growth areas consistent with our strategy  we continued to expand our midstream operations where we have large scale assets in growth basins 
on october   we signed definitive agreements to construct  own and operate a mile extension of our oil and gas pipelines from our devils tower spar to the blind faith prospect located in mississippi canyon 
this extension  estimated to cost million  is expected to be ready for service by the third quarter of also  in september we received board approval to expand our existing gas processing plant located near opal  wyoming  by adding a fifth cryogenic train capable of processing up to mmcfd 
this plant expansion is expected to be in service by the second quarter of to begin processing gas from the pinedale anticline field 
favorable commodity price margins the actual realized ngl per unit margins at our processing plants exceeded midstream s historical five year annual average for the last six quarters 
however  the industry benchmark for ngl fractionation spreads at mont belvieu  texas was percent below fractionation spreads 
the geographic diversification of midstream assets contributed significantly to our actual realized unit margins exceeding the industry benchmark at mont belvieu for gas processing spreads 
the largest impact is realized at our western united states gas processing plants  which benefit from lower regional market natural gas prices 
a decline in volumes in recent quarters is largely due to the third quarter impact of summer hurricanes on our gulf coast facilities as well as lower fourth quarter ngl recoveries at our west region plants 
the lower ngl recoveries in the west were the result of intermittent periods in which the spread between ngl and natural gas prices was such that it was uneconomical to recover ngls 
domestic gathering and processing net per unit ngl margin with production and sales volumes by quarter bar graph 
table of contents outlook for the following factors could impact our business in and beyond 
as evidenced in recent years  natural gas and crude oil markets are highly volatile despite above average margins at our gas processing plants in recent years 
although ngl margins earned at our gas processing plants in were above the five year average  we expect unit margins in to trend downward towards historical averages 
both gathering and processing volumes at our facilities are also expected to be at or above levels of previous years due to continued strong drilling activities in our core basins 
we expect continued expansion of our gathering and processing systems in our gulf coast and west regions to keep pace with increased demand for our services 
in  we will continue to invest in facilities in the growth basins in which we provide services 
the phase i expansion of our wamsutter gathering system is scheduled to be operational during the first quarter of based on recent market price forecasts  we anticipate olefins unit margins to be somewhat lower than levels 
as disclosed in the critical accounting policies and estimates section of this item  it is possible that our investment in our canadian olefins assets may not be recoverable without modification to or a renegotiation of key terms in an off gas processing agreement 
we are evaluating our alternatives and will continue to monitor the recoverability of our investment 
we expect continued growth in the deepwater areas of the gulf of mexico to contribute to  and become a larger component of  our future segment revenues and segment profit 
we expect these additional fee based revenues to lower our proportionate exposure to commodity price risks

domestic gathering processing the million decrease in domestic gathering and processing segment profit includes a million decline in the gulf coast region  largely offset by a million increase in the west region 
the million increase in our west region s segment profit primarily results from higher gathering and processing fee revenues  and the absence of an asset write down and other charges  offset partially by higher operating expenses and lower net ngl margins 
the significant drivers to these items are as follows gathering and processing fee revenues increased million primarily as a result of higher average per unit gathering and processing rates and higher volumes in the rocky mountain production area due to increased drilling activity 
a portion of this increase is also due to the increase in volumes subject to fee based processing contracts

the significant components of the net increase include the following net ngl margins at our gulf coast gas processing plants increased million due to a percent increase in ngl production volumes which represented million of the increase in margins 
the significantly higher ngl volumes were driven by the favorable spread between ngl and natural gas prices coupled with the recently completed production handling infrastructure flowing additional deepwater gas production to our plants

production volumes increased as a 
table of contents result of increased spot sales and the new higher fixed margin contract at our giesmar facility while our canadian and gulf liquids volumes benefited from improved plant operations 
the favorable variances above are partially offset by a million impairment charge related to our equity investment in the discovery partnership  reflecting management s assessment that there was an other than temporary decline in the value of this investment 
other overview of as discussed below  the million other segment loss is primarily associated with our equity method investment in longhorn 
shipping volumes on the longhorn pipeline declined significantly during the second quarter of compared to those experienced in the first quarter 
the decline was due primarily to the impact of significant changes in transportation pricing competition and economics in the wake of significantly higher crude oil prices 
longhorn management indicated that the shortfall in volumes was likely to continue and that continued operation as originally planned was no longer economically feasible 
as a result  the owners and management of longhorn began evaluating several alternatives for the future operation of longhorn 
to ensure adequate liquidity to continue operations while assessing alternatives  during the third quarter of longhorn obtained a million bridge loan commitment from existing investors 
the loan is secured by a first lien on the assets of longhorn 
we have fully funded our million commitment of this loan  which has a one year term and an interest rate of percent 
our receivable related to this loan is included in accounts and notes receivable on the consolidated balance sheet 
the loan agreement allows for an additional million loan  secured by the same first lien on the assets of longhorn 
all existing investors will have the opportunity to participate in funding the second million increment 
we do not expect to participate as a lender in this additional increment 
based on management s outlook for longhorn at the end of the second quarter  we assessed our investment in longhorn to determine if there had been an other than temporary decline in its fair value 
as a result  we recorded an impairment of million during the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  management of longhorn decided to pursue a strategy of the sale of longhorn 
as a result  longhorn is negotiating a purchase and sale agreement 
based on initial indications from potential buyers  we determined that our longhorn investment would require full impairment 
therefore  in fourth quarter  we recorded a million impairment to write off the remaining investment in longhorn 
on april   we completed a contract to transfer our longhorn operating agreement to a new operator in exchange for payments of approximately  a month  adjusted for inflation  over the next seven years 
the transfer became effective may  realization of the longhorn operating agreement payments is dependent upon the continued operation of longhorn 
any payments received as a result of the ongoing payment stream or through monetization of the contract will be recognized as income when received 
outlook for projected volumes indicate that longhorn will continue to operate at a loss until a sale is complete 
however  as a result of the full write off of our investment in longhorn during the fourth quarter of  we will no longer recognize equity losses associated with this investment 
we currently expect to receive full payment on the million bridge loan from the proceeds of the sale

we included counterparties with a minimum standard poor s rating of bbb or moody s investors service rating of baa in investment grade 
we also classify counterparties that have provided sufficient collateral  such as cash  standby letters of credit  adequate parent company guarantees  and property interests  as investment grade 
trading policy we have policies and procedures that govern our trading and risk management activities 
these policies cover authority and delegation thereof in addition to control requirements  authorized commodities and term and exposure limitations 
power s value at risk is limited in aggregate and calculated at a percent confidence level 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition outlook we believe we have  or have access to  the financial resources and liquidity necessary to meet future requirements for working capital  capital and investment expenditures and debt payments while maintaining a sufficient level of liquidity to reasonably protect against unforeseen circumstances requiring the use of funds 
in  we expect to continue to reduce debt through scheduled debt payments and exchanges  while maintaining liquidity from cash and unused revolving credit facilities of at least billion 
we are maintaining this level as we consider the potential impact of significant changes in commodity prices  contract margin requirements above current levels  unplanned capital spending needs and the need to meet near term scheduled debt payments 
we expect to fund capital and investment expenditures  debt payments  dividends  and working capital requirements through cash flow from operations  which is currently estimated to be between billion and billion in  proceeds from debt issuances and sales of units of williams partners  lp  as well as cash and cash equivalents on hand as needed 
we enter positioned for growth through disciplined investments in our natural gas businesses 
examples of this planned growth include gas pipeline will continue to expand its system to meet the demand of growth markets 
additionally  northwest pipeline will construct an mile pipeline loop  which will replace most of the capacity previously served by miles of pipeline in the washington state area 
exploration production s march operating lease agreement will provide access to ten new drilling rigs each for a lease term of three years that will allow us to accelerate the pace of developing our natural gas reserves in the piceance basin through both deployment of the additional rigs and the rigs designed drilling and operational efficiencies 
we received our first two rigs in january and february and they have begun drilling 
midstream will continue to pursue significant deepwater production commitments and expand capacity in the western united states 
we estimate capital and investment expenditures will total approximately billion to billion in of the total estimated capital expenditures for  million to billion is for capital expenditures at exploration production 
also within the total estimated expenditures for is approximately million to million for maintenance related projects at gas pipeline  including pipeline replacement and clean air act compliance 
commitments for construction and acquisition of property  plant and equipment are approximately million at december  in november  we initiated an offer to induce conversion of up to million of the percent junior subordinated convertible debentures into our common stock 
the conversion was executed in january and approximately million of the debentures were exchanged for common stock 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we have proposed to sell an approximate percent interest in our gathering and processing assets in the four corners area to williams partners lp the terms of this proposed transaction  including price  will be subject to the approval of our board of directors and the board of directors of the general partner of williams partners lp potential risks associated with our planned levels of liquidity and the planned capital and investment expenditures discussed above include lower than expected levels of cash flow from operations due to commodity pricing volatility 
to mitigate this exposure  exploration production has economically hedged the price of natural gas for approximately mmcfe per day of its expected production of to mmcfe per day 
power has entered into fixed forward sales contracts that economically cover substantially all of its fixed demand obligations through 
table of contents sensitivity of margin requirements associated with our marginable commodity contracts 
as of december  we estimate our exposure to additional margin requirements over the next days to be no more than million  using a statistical analysis at a percent confidence level

overview liquidity our internal and external sources of liquidity include cash generated from our operations  bank financings  proceeds from asset sales and issuance of long term debt and equity securities 
while most of our sources are available to us at the parent level  others are available to certain of our subsidiaries  including equity issuances from williams partners  lp our ability to raise funds in the capital markets will be impacted by our financial condition  interest rates  market conditions  and industry conditions 
available liquidity year ended december  millions cash and cash equivalents auction rate securities and other liquid securities available capacity under our four unsecured revolving and letter of credit facilities totaling billion available capacity under our billion secured revolving and letter of credit facility additional liquidity shelf registration for a variety of debt and equity securities shelf registration for debt only available to northwest pipeline and transco cash and cash equivalents includes million of funds received from third parties as collateral 
the obligation for these amounts is reported as customer margin deposits payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
this facility is secured by the common stock of transco and guaranteed by williams gas pipeline company  llc northwest pipeline and transco each have access to million under this facility to the extent not utilized by us 
williams partners lp has access to million  to the extent not utilized by us that we guarantee 
the ability of northwest pipeline to utilize these registration statements for debt securities is restricted by certain covenants of its debt agreements 
so long as our credit rating is below investment grade  northwest pipeline and transco can only use their shelf registration statements to issue debt if such debt is guaranteed by us 
financial ratios and credit ratings one of our objectives for is to continue the improvement in our financial ratios  with the ultimate goal of achieving ratios comparable to investment grade rated companies at some point in the future 
our end of year debt to capitalization ratio is percent in  percent in and percent in we expect the ratio to be to percent for debt includes long term debt and long term debt due within one year 
capitalization includes long term debt due within one year  long term debt  and stockholders

year ended december  millions net cash provided used by operating activities financing activities investing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly from and increased by percent from a primary driver in net cash provided by operating activities is income from continuing operations  which increased primarily as a result of higher gas production volumes and net average realized prices for production sold 
refer to results of operations in item for more detailed information regarding income from continuing operations 
also contributing to the increase in income from continuing operations is the reduction in interest expense due to lower average borrowing levels 
cash payments for interest decreased million from in addition to the changes in results of operations  net cash inflows from margin deposits and customer margin deposits payable decreased significantly from in  our power 
table of contents subsidiary issued a significant number of letters of credit to replace its cash margin deposits 
as the letters of credit were issued  the counterparties returned our cash margin deposits to us 
due to fewer letters of credit being issued to replace cash margin deposits in and  we have fewer receipts of margin deposits than in other  including changes in noncurrent assets and liabilities  includes contributions to our tax qualified pension plans of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
it is our policy to make annual contributions to our tax qualified pension plans in an amount equal to the greater of the actuarially computed annual normal cost plus any unfunded actuarial accrued liability  amortized over approximately five years  or the minimum required contribution under existing tax laws 
additional amounts may be contributed to increase the funded status of the plans 
in an effort to strengthen our funded status and take advantage of strong cash flows  we contributed approximately million more than our funding policy required in and million more than our funding policy required in financing activities during  our net cash provided used by financing activities was a source of cash as compared to a use in and during  we received approximately million reported in proceeds from issuance of common stock resulting from the exercise of the feline pacs equity forward contracts

during  we repaid long term debt through tender offers and early retirements 
we also reduced our debt through our feline pacs exchange 
this noncash exchange resulted in payments of fees and expenses reported as premiums paid on tender offer  early debt retirements and feline pacs exchange 
during  we repurchased our outstanding percent cumulative convertible preferred shares 
we also repaid the rmt note payable and we refinanced our long term debt at more favorable rates

table of contents in  we began the year positioned for growth and have used additional cash flow for capital expenditures primarily at exploration production 
see a detail of capital expenditures by segment below 
capital expenditures millions capital expenditures graph exploration production made capital expenditures in primarily for development drilling in the piceance basin 
gas pipeline made capital expenditures in primarily for normal maintenance and compliance 
midstream gas liquids made capital expenditures in primarily for further expanding our systems in existing basins 
off balance sheet financing arrangements and guarantees of debt or other commitments in january  we terminated our two unsecured revolving and letter of credit facilities totaling million and replaced them with two new facilities that contain similar terms but fewer restrictions 
in september  we also entered into two new revolving and letter of credit facilities that have a similar structure see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have provided a guarantee for obligations of williams partners lp under the billion secured revolving and letter of credit facility 
we have various other guarantees and commitments which are disclosed in notes     and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we do not believe these guarantees or the possible fulfillment of them will prevent us from meeting our liquidity needs 

table of contents contractual obligations the table below summarizes the maturity dates of our contractual obligations by period 
thereafter total millions long term debt  including current portion principal interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations fuel conversion and other service contracts other other long term liabilities  including current portion physical and financial derivatives other total excludes sublease income of billion consisting of million in  million in  and million in includes a power tolling agreement that is accounted for as an operating lease 
power has entered into certain contracts giving us the right to receive fuel conversion services as well as certain other services associated with electric generation facilities that are currently in operation throughout the continental united states 
certain of power s tolling agreements could be considered leases pursuant to the guidance in eitf issue  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  if in the future the agreements are modified for any reason 
if deemed to be a capital lease  the net present value of the fixed demand payments would be reported on the consolidated balance sheet consistent with other capital lease obligations  and as an asset in property  plant and equipment net 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
although the amounts presented represent expected cash outflows  a portion of those obligations has previously been paid in accordance with third party margining agreements 
as of december   we have paid million in margins  adequate assurance  and prepayments related to the obligations included in this disclosure 
in addition  the obligations for physical and financial derivatives are based on market information as of december  because market information changes daily and has the potential to be volatile  significant changes to the values in this category may occur 
includes one year of annual payments totaling million for contracts with indefinite termination dates 
expected offsetting cash inflows resulting from product sales or net positive settlements are not reflected in these amounts 
the expected offsetting cash inflows as of december   are approximately billion 
effects of inflation our operations in recent years have benefited from relatively low inflation rates 
approximately percent of our gross property  plant and equipment is at gas pipeline and approximately percent is at other operating units 
gas pipeline is subject to regulation  which limits recovery to historical cost 
while amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable under current ferc practices  we anticipate being allowed to recover and earn a return based on increased actual cost incurred to replace existing assets 
cost 
table of contents based regulation  along with competition and other market factors  may limit our ability to recover such increased costs 
for the other operating units  operating costs are influenced to a greater extent by specific price changes in oil and natural gas and related commodities than by changes in general inflation 
crude  refined product  natural gas  natural gas liquids and power prices are particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or the market perceptions concerning the supply and demand balance in the near future 
however  our exposure to these price changes is reduced through the use of hedging instruments 
environmental we are a participant in certain environmental activities in various stages including assessment studies  cleanup operations and or remedial processes at certain sites  some of which we currently do not own see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are monitoring these sites in a coordinated effort with other potentially responsible parties  the us environmental protection agency epa  or other governmental authorities 
we are jointly and severally liable along with unrelated third parties in some of these activities and solely responsible in others 
current estimates of the most likely costs of such activities are approximately million  all of which are recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet at december  we will seek recovery of approximately million of the accrued costs through future natural gas transmission rates 
the remainder of these costs will be funded from operations 
during  we paid approximately million for cleanup and or remediation and monitoring activities 
we expect to pay approximately million in for these activities 
estimates of the most likely costs of cleanup are generally based on completed assessment studies  preliminary results of studies or our experience with other similar cleanup operations 
at december   certain assessment studies were still in process for which the ultimate outcome may yield significantly different estimates of most likely costs 
therefore  the actual costs incurred will depend on the final amount  type and extent of contamination discovered at these sites  the final cleanup standards mandated by the epa or other governmental authorities  and other factors 
we are subject to the federal clean air act and to the federal clean air act amendments of  which require the epa to issue new regulations 
we are also subject to regulation at the state and local level 
in september  the epa promulgated rules designed to mitigate the migration of ground level ozone in certain states 
in march and june  the epa promulgated additional regulation regarding hazardous air pollutants  which may impose additional controls 
capital expenditures necessary to install emission control devices on our transco gas pipeline system to comply with rules were approximately million in and are estimated to be between million and million subsequent to the actual costs incurred will depend on the final implementation plans developed by each state to comply with these regulations 
we consider these costs on our transco system associated with compliance with these environmental laws and regulations to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business and  therefore  recoverable through its rates 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our current interest rate risk exposure is related primarily to our debt portfolio 
the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
the maturity of our long term debt portfolio is partially influenced by the expected life of our operating assets 
the tables below provide information about our interest rate risk sensitive instruments as of december  and long term debt in the tables represents principal cash flows  net of discount premium  and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair value of our publicly traded long term debt is valued using indicative year end traded bond market prices 
private debt is valued based on the prices of similar securities with similar terms and credit ratings 
fair value december  thereafter total dollars in millions long term debt  including current portion fixed rate interest rate variable rate interest rate fair value december  thereafter total dollars in millions long term debt  including current portion fixed rate interest rate variable rate interest rate including unamortized discount and premium 
the weighted average interest rate for is libor plus percent 
the weighted average interest rate for was libor plus percent 
excludes capital leases 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  electricity  refined products and natural gas liquids  as well as other market factors  such as market volatility and commodity price correlations  including correlations between crude oil and gas prices and between natural gas and power prices 
we are exposed to these risks in connection with our owned energy related assets  our long term energy related contracts and our proprietary trading activities 
we manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations using various derivatives and non derivative energy related contracts 
the fair value of derivative contracts is subject to changes in energy commodity market prices  the liquidity and volatility of the markets in which the contracts are transacted  and changes in interest rates 
we measure the risk in our portfolios using a value at risk methodology to estimate the potential one day loss from adverse changes in the fair value of the portfolios 
value at risk requires a number of key assumptions and is not necessarily representative of actual losses in fair value that could be incurred from the portfolios 
our value at risk model uses a monte carlo method to 
table of contents simulate hypothetical movements in future market prices and assumes that  as a result of changes in commodity prices  there is a percent probability that the one day loss in fair value of the portfolios will not exceed the value at risk 
the simulation method uses historical correlations and market forward prices and volatilities 
in applying the value at risk methodology  we do not consider that the simulated hypothetical movements affect the positions or would cause any potential liquidity issues  nor do we consider that changing the portfolio in response to market conditions could affect market prices and could take longer than a one day holding period to execute 
while a one day holding period has historically been the industry standard  a longer holding period could more accurately represent the true market risk given market liquidity and our own credit and liquidity constraints 
we segregate our derivative contracts into trading and nontrading contracts  as defined in the following paragraphs 
we calculate value at risk separately for these two categories 
derivative contracts designated as normal purchases or sales under sfas and nonderivative energy contracts have been excluded from our estimation of value at risk 
trading our trading portfolio consists of derivative contracts entered into for purposes other than economically hedging our commodity price risk exposure 
only contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
our value at risk for contracts held for trading purposes was approximately million at december   and million at december  during the year ended december   our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of million to a low of million 
nontrading our nontrading portfolio consists of contracts that hedge or could potentially hedge the price risk exposure from the following activities segment commodity price risk exposure exploration production natural gas sales midstream natural gas purchases power natural gas purchases and sales electricity purchases and sales the value at risk for contracts held for nontrading purposes was million at december   and million at december  during the year ended december   our value at risk for these contracts ranged from a high of million to a low of million 
certain of the contracts held for nontrading purposes are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas we do not consider the underlying commodity positions to which the cash flow hedges relate in our value at risk model 
therefore  value at risk does not represent economic losses that could occur on a total nontrading portfolio that includes the underlying commodity positions 
foreign currency risk we have international investments that could affect our financial results if the investments incur a permanent decline in value as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and or the economic conditions in foreign countries 
international investments accounted for under the cost method totaled million and million at december   and  respectively 
these investments are primarily in nonpublicly traded companies for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value 
we believe that we can realize the carrying value of these investments considering the status of the operations of the companies underlying these investments 
if a percent change occurred in the value of the underlying currencies of these investments against the us dollar  the fair value at december   could change by approximately million assuming a direct correlation between the currency fluctuation and the value of the investments 

table of contents net assets of consolidated foreign operations whose functional currency is the local currency are located primarily in canada and approximate six percent of our net assets at december   and these foreign operations do not have significant transactions or financial instruments denominated in other currencies 
however  these investments do have the potential to impact our financial position  due to fluctuations in these local currencies arising from the process of re measuring the local functional currency into the us dollar 
as an example  a percent change in the respective functional currencies against the us dollar could have changed stockholders equity by approximately million at december
