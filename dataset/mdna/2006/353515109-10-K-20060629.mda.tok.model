the current year also benefited from lower net interest expenses primarily because of lower levels of debt outstanding 
on an overall basis  we do not believe there were any material trends in sales or expenses in fiscal however  sales of our rolodex electronics products have declined for the last five years primarily because of the use of other devices  such as personal computers and cell phones  to perform organizer functions and our us consumer sales declined in fiscal while sales by our proximity technology division increased 
a significant portion of our proximity technology division sales are dependant upon a few contracts with major customers  many of which are not of a recurring nature 
in fiscal  we had two contracts aggregating  in revenue and do not anticipate this level of revenue in our proximity technology division for fiscal pretax income for the year ended march  increased to  from  in the prior year mainly due to a increase in gross margin resulting from higher sales and a slightly improved gross margin percentage  and a decrease of in interest expense

changes in financial condition accounts receivable increased by to  on march  from  on march  primarily because of an increase in receivables of in our proximity technology division related to two technology licensing agreements in the current year 
inventory decreased by  to  on march  from  on march  primarily as a result of a reduction in our component inventory

the credit agreement replaces a financing arrangement that expired by its terms on december  the credit agreement provides for a  revolving credit facility the loan for the company 
at our option  loans under the credit agreement will be either domestic rate loans based on pnc s base rate with the interest rate varying from the pnc base rate minus basis points to the pnc base rate plus basis points or libor rate loans with the interest rate varying from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points  both rates depending upon the ratio of our funded debt to ebitda and the composition of collateral provided 
loans under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants and restrictions on indebtedness  business combinations and other related items 
as of march  we were in compliance with all covenants and there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
we rely primarily on our operating cash flow to support our operations 
over the last three years we generated cash flow from operations of  this operating cash flow is supplemented by our credit agreement to meet seasonal financing needs 
we believe our cash flow from operations  available borrowing under our credit agreement and existing cash and short term investment balances will be adequate to satisfy our cash needs for the next twelve months 
the amount of credit available under the facility at any time is based upon a formula applied to our accounts receivable and inventory 
as of march   we had credit available of  our credit availability and borrowings under the facility fluctuate during the year because of the seasonal nature of our business 
during the year ended march   maximum availability and borrowings under our credit agreement approximated  and  respectively 
we do not have any significant capital leases and anticipate that depreciation and amortization for fiscal will exceed planned capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see summary of significant accounting policies more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our fixed assets  goodwill and other non current assets  we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
during the year ended march   we recorded a charge for impairment in the value of our license for the rolodex electronics trademark of  in the year ended march   we recorded an additional charge of  related to the value of this asset 
as of march  the asset is recorded at its estimated fair value 
inventory valuation we review the net realizable value and forecast demand for our products on a quarterly basis to ensure that inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and that obsolete inventory is written off 
factors that could impact forecast demand and selling prices for our products include the timing and success of new product launches  competitor actions  supplier prices and general economic conditions 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 

table of contents allowance for bad debts and returns we provide an allowance for bad debts and product returns on a monthly basis based upon historical sales  credit and return experience 
the adequacy of these allowances is determined by regularly reviewing accounts receivable and returns and applying historical experience to the current balance with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of our customers as well as past payment history and overall trends in past due accounts and returns 
historically  our allowances have been sufficient for any customer write offs or returns 
although we cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 
multiple element arrangements we occasionally enter into multiple element arrangements  primarily involving the licensing of our software technology 
during the june quarter we entered into a single multiple element arrangement which included technology licensing fees and annual support fees with a value of and  respectively
