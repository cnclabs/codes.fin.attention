item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
executive overview introduction we are a diversified financial holding company headquartered in san juan  puerto rico  offering a broad array of financial services through our wholly owned banking subsidiary  eurobank  and our wholly owned insurance agency subsidiary  euroseguros 
as of december   we had  on a consolidated basis  total assets of billion  net loans and leases of billion  total deposits of billion  and stockholders equity of million 
we currently operate through a network of branch offices located throughout puerto rico 
on may   we acquired all of the capital stock of the bank trust of puerto rico  a commercial bank headquartered in san juan  puerto rico 
on the closing date  the estimated fair value of assets acquired was million and the estimated fair value of the deposits and other liabilities assumed was million 
we were incorporated on november  and became the parent bank holding company for eurobank on july  our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
additionally  eurobank statutory trust i and eurobank statutory trust ii are special purpose vehicles that were used to issue trust preferred securities 
it should be noted  however  that in december  the fasb issued a revision to financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  that required the deconsolidation of certain variable interest entities  such as our statutory trust subsidiaries that issued the trust preferred securities 
effective december   we adopted the provisions of fin no 
r  requiring the deconsolidation of these trusts 
as a result  our statutory trusts are no longer consolidated with us or eurobank 
commencing on december   we refer to the trust preferred securities we issued through eurobank statutory trust i and eurobank statutory trust ii as notes payable to statutory trusts instead of trust preferred securities  as we had prior to that date 
over the past three years  we have experienced significant balance sheet growth 
our management team has implemented a strategy of building our core banking franchise by focusing on commercial loans  business transaction accounts  our lease financing business and acquisitions 
we believe that this strategy will increase recurring revenue streams  enhance profitability  broaden our product and service offerings and continue to build stockholder value 
in and  we raised an aggregate of million through the issuance of junior subordinated debentures in connection with the trust preferred securities issuances mentioned above 
we believe that the supplemental capital raised in connection with the issuance of these securities will allow us to achieve and maintain our status as a well capitalized institution and to sustain our continued loan growth 
we completed our initial public offering in august in which we sold  shares of our common stock at the initial offering price of per share 
in september  we sold an additional  shares in connection with the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  also at the initial offering price of per share 
the net proceeds that we received from the offering plus the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  after deducting offering expenses  including underwriting discounts and commissions  were approximately million 
on october   eurobancshares board of directors announced the authorization of a program to acquire shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to million in open market purchases  block trades and privately negotiated transactions over a period of one year 
as of december   we had purchased  shares of our common stock under the program 
on november   we recorded  shares at a price of per share held in treasury as a result of a payment in lieu of foreclosure from a former customer 
explanatory note as to reclassification in the consolidated statements of income during our assessment of internal controls as required by the sarbanes oxley act of  we found a classification error related to the application of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases fas 
fas requires that loan origination fees and related direct loan origination costs  mainly salaries and certain other incremental general and administrative expenses  be offset and the net amount deferred and recognized over the contractual life of the loan  as an adjustment of yield 
historically  we had been recording certain direct costs associated with loan and lease originations as a credit to interest income rather than as a credit to the appropriate expense line item 
these costs have been appropriately amortized to interest income as cost over the life of the loan or its holding period  whichever is less 
although this inadvertent misclassification did not impact the net earnings or the earnings per share of the company  it affected several line items of the consolidated statements of income 
accordingly  we have made corresponding reclassifications to prior periods to conform with this year s presentation 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our performance and results of operations in our total assets grew to billion at the end of  representing an increase of  from billion at the end of  our net loans and leases grew to billion at the end of  representing an increase of  from billion at the end of  our total deposits grew to billion at the end of  representing an increase of  from billion at the end of  our total revenue grew to million in  representing an increase of  from million in  our net interest spread on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased to in  compared to in  our provision for loan and lease losses grew to million in  representing an increase of  from million in  and our total noninterest expense grew to million in  representing an increase of  from million in these items  as well as other factors  resulted in a net income before extraordinary gain for of million  compared to million in  or per common share as compared to per common share for  assuming dilution  and are discussed in further detail throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a description of our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
loans and allowance for loan and lease losses loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future  or until maturity or payoff  are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balances adjusted by any charge offs  unearned finance charges  allowance for loan and lease losses  and net deferred nonrefundable fees or costs on origination 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate to provide for probable collection losses in our loan and lease portfolio 
losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance account at the time a loss is incurred or a recovery is received 
the allowance for loan and lease losses amounted to million  million  and million as of december   and  respectively 
losses charged to the allowance amounted to million  million  and million as of december   and  respectively 
recoveries were credited to the allowance in the amounts of million  million  and million for those same periods  respectively 
we follow a consistent procedural discipline and account for loan and lease loss contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
to mitigate any difference between estimates and actual results relative to the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses  our loan review department is specifically charged with reviewing monthly delinquency reports to determine if additional allowances are necessary 
delinquency reports and analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses are also provided to senior management and the board of directors on a monthly basis 
the loan review department evaluates significant changes in delinquency with regard to a particular loan portfolio to determine the potential for continuing trends  and loss projections are estimated and adjustments are made to the historical loss factor applied to that portfolio in connection with the calculation of loss allowances 
portfolio performance is also monitored through the monthly calculation of the percentage of non performing loans to the total portfolio outstanding 
a significant change in this percentage may trigger a review of the portfolio and eventually lead to additional allowances 
we also track the ratio of net charge offs to total portfolio outstanding 
our methodology for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired loans is based on classifications of loans into various categories and loss percentages that are commonly used for regulatory purposes 
for non classified loans  the estimated allowance is based on historical loss experiences as adjusted for changes in trends and conditions on an annual basis 
these trends are monitored to prevent possible deviations from the loss factors used for the methodology 
in connection with our ongoing evaluation and testing activities under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related rules and regulations  we have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making our assessment of internal control over financial reporting  we are using the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
based on the criteria established in coso  we concluded that certain conditions exist which constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  as part of our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over the allowance for loan and lease losses adequacy  we identified several deficiencies  which when evaluated in the aggregate  were considered a material weakness 
such deficiencies are related to controls over certain aspects of the monitoring and documentation of recent loss trends of portfolios  the segregation of portfolios for purposes of the calculations of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  and the documentation of the unallocated portion of the allowance 
as a result of the material weakness  we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  notwithstanding the foregoing  the financial information that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k has been adjusted to properly account for recent loss trends and conditions 
an adjustment to the allowance for loan and lease losses in the amount of million million net of taxes was recorded prior to the issuance of the company s financial statements as of december  in addition  we have commenced a remediation process post year end and intend to improve and remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
for additional information concerning this material weakness  see the item a 
controls and procedures 
with the exception of the commercial loans pool and loans secured by real estate with a or lower loan to value  loans that are more than days delinquent result in an additional allowance 
when commercial loans become days delinquent  each is subjected to full review by the loan review officer including  but not limited to  a review of financial statements  repayment ability and collateral held 
depending on the findings  our allowance may be increased 
in connection with this review  the loan review officer will determine what economic factors may have led to the change in the client s ability to service the obligation  and this in turn may result in an additional review of a particular sector of the economy 
for additional information relating to how each portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined  see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned allowance for loan and lease losses 
we believe that our allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate  however  regulatory agencies  including the commissioner of financial institutions of puerto rico and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may from time to time require us to reclassify our loans and leases or make additional provisions to our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we classify loans as nonperforming when they become days past due 
nonperforming loans amounted to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
servicing assets we have no contracts to service loans for others  except for servicing rights retained on lease sales 
the total cost of loans or leases to be sold with servicing assets retained is allocated to the servicing assets and the loans or leases without the servicing assets  based on their relative fair values 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
in addition  we assess capitalized servicing assets for impairment based on the fair value of those assets 
to estimate the fair value of servicing assets we consider prices for similar assets and the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the servicing assets calculated using assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future servicing income and expense  including discount rates  anticipated prepayment and credit loss rates 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of capitalized servicing assets  we evaluate separately servicing retained for each loan portfolio sold 
the amount of impairment recognized  if any  is the amount by which the capitalized servicing assets exceed its estimated fair value 
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance with changes included in net income for the period in which the change occurs 
the key assumptions we utilized in measuring the servicing asset at the date the sales were completed during the year ended december   were as follows march  prepayment rate of  weighted average live of years  and a discount rate of  september  prepayment rate of  weighted average live of years  and a discount rate of  and september  prepayment rate of  weighted average live of years  and a discount rate of 
the key assumptions we utilized in measuring the servicing assets at the dates the sales were completed during the year ended december   were as follows prepayment rate of  weighted average live in years of  and a discount rate of 
the key assumptions we utilized in measuring the servicing assets at the dates the sales completed during the year ended december   were as follows prepayment rate of  weighted average life in years of to  and a discount rate of to 
impairment analyses were performed in december  june and december by an independent third party and it was determined that there was no impairment for december and an impairment for june and december  which resulted in an adjustment of approximately  and  respectively  on the servicing assets acquired from banktrust 
servicing assets are included as part of other assets in the balance sheets 
servicing assets recorded amounted to million  million  and million as of december   and  respectively 
although sale of loans in and were million and million  respectively  the servicing assets in decreased mainly because the sale of loans in was distributed between march and september  while sale of loans during occurred in november servicing assets in increased as a result of sale of loans made during the year and our acquisition of banktrust 
as of december  and  servicing assets acquired from banktrust amounted to approximately  and  respectively 
other real estate owned and repossessed assets other real estate owned  or oreo  and repossessed assets  normally obtained through foreclosure or other workout situations  are initially recorded at the lower of fair value or book value at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
any resulting loss is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
an appraisal of other real estate properties and valuation of repossessed assets is made periodically after its acquisition  and comparison between the appraised value and the carrying value is performed 
additional declines in value after acquisition  if any  are charged to current operations 
other real estate owned amounted to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
other repossessed assets amounted to million  million and million for those same periods  respectively 
results of operations as of and for the years ended december   and net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan  lease and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  in and a increase of million  or  in these increases were due to the combined result of increases in average interest earning assets and increased yields resulting from higher interest rates during our net interest margin remained at for the year ended december   compared to year ended december   and increased from for the year ended december  our net interest spread decreased to in  from in  and increased from in the decline in net interest spread in was caused primarily by the rising short term interest rates and flattening yield curve  which caused borrowing costs to increase at a faster rate than the yield on earning assets 
the increase between year ended december  and was mainly attributable to increased volume of interest earnings assets and liabilities combined with the rises in interest rates experienced since the second quarter of our average interest earning assets were billion in  compared with billion in and billion in  representing increases of in and in average net loans were billion in  compared to billion in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively 
the average interest yield we received for interest earning assets increased to in  from in  and from in during and  the federal reserve board s interest rate raises positively impacted average yields on our commercial and construction loans since approximately and  respectively  were variable rate loans 
during the past few years  we have positioned our investment portfolio for an increase in interest rates by purchasing mostly investments with maturities or estimated maturities between to years 
during  we were able to reinvest at higher yields and for maturities or estimated maturities from years to years 
due to the interest rate rises and the growth of interest earning assets in and  attributable in part to our acquisition of the bank trust of puerto rico on may   our total interest income significantly increased by to million in  from million in  and to million in  from million in in addition  during  the average interest yield we received for other investment securities was impacted by the maturity of high yield investments at the end of average interest bearing liabilities also increased by to billion in  compared to billion in  after increasing by from million in total interest expense increased by to million in  compared to million in  after increasing by from million in during  the increase in average liabilities has been substantially in brokered deposits and other borrowings  higher cost categories 
these increases in our interest expense were mainly due to the significant growth of our deposit portfolio  which  during  was attributable in part to our acquisition of the bank trust of puerto rico on may  the average interest rate we paid for interest bearing liabilities increased to in  from in  and from in the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  our average balances of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  in addition to the major components of net interest income and our net interest margin 
net loans and leases shown on these tables include nonaccrual loans although interest accrued but not collected on these loans is placed in nonaccrual status and reversed against interest income

net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
represents the average rate earned on interest earning assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
represents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
reclassifications decreasing loan interest income with corresponding equal decreases in salaries and employee benefits have been made in the amount of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  to conform with this year s presentation 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the dollar amount of changes in interest earned and paid for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of change attributable to changes in average daily balances volume or changes in average daily interest rates rate

reclassifications decreasing loan interest income with corresponding equal decreases in salaries and employee benefits have been made in the amount of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  to conform with this year s presentation 
provision for loan and lease losses we determine a provision for loan and lease losses that we consider sufficient to maintain an allowance to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
for additional information concerning this determination  see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned allowance for loan and lease losses 
our provision for loan and lease losses increased to million in  from million in  and from million in the increase in the provision during resulted from the growth in our loan portfolio and the net losses experienced  mainly in our leasing portfolio 
during  the net charge offs increased to million  from million in the increase in our provision during was mainly due to the growth of our total loan and lease portfolio  resulting in an increase in nonperforming loans and leases  and an increase in our net charges offs to million in  from million in also  during  the increase in our nonperforming loans and net charge offs was also  in part  a result of our acquisition of the bank trust of puerto rico on may   on which we acquired a million loan portfolio 
in addition  steady growth in our commercial lending portfolio has dictated continual increases in our provision for loan and lease losses 
in the other lending categories  such as consumer lending  residential construction lending and mortgage lending  growth has not been robust 
we believe existing allowance levels are appropriate 
while our allowance for loan and lease losses is established in different portfolio components  we maintain an allowance that we believe is sufficient to absorb all credit losses inherent in our portfolio 
in order to maintain an adequate level of our allowance for loan and lease losses  we monitor our portfolio performance on a monthly basis and determine the additional provision for loan and lease losses 
in the last quarter of  we increased our provision for loan and lease losses as we experienced an unexpected increase in the number of repossessed vehicles resulting from the impairment of certain leases in our automobile leasing portfolio 
for and  our provisions increased in a uniform manner  in concert with the increases and losses in our commercial loan portfolio and our lease portfolio 
during and  risk levels and losses in these portfolios have been fairly constant 
individual credits that are less than satisfactory or delinquent are reviewed on an ongoing basis to determine whether additional provisions are necessary 
for additional information relating to how each portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined  see the section of this discussion and analysis captioned allowance for loan and lease losses 
because we do not have any major industry concentrations  the determination of our provision for loan and lease losses is not impacted by such industry concentrations 
noninterest income the following tables set forth the various components of our noninterest income for the periods indicated year ended december  amount amount amount dollars in thousands service charges and other fees loss on sale of non hedging derivatives  net gain on sale of loans and leases  net loss gain on sale of securities  net loss on sale of other real estate owned  repossessed assets  and on disposition of other assets  net total noninterest income our total noninterest income was million in  as compared to million in  and million in  representing a decrease of in and an increase of in noninterest income represented approximately  and of average assets in  and  respectively 
as a result of our efforts to diversify our revenue sources  we currently earn noninterest income from various sources 
our largest noninterest income source is service charges  primarily on deposit accounts  representing  and of total noninterest income in  and  respectively 
this income source increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in was primarily due to an increase in our fees from trust and merchant accounts  and commissions from other bank services  while the increase in was primarily due to an increase in our number of transactional and savings accounts 
during  the increase in commissions from other bank services was mainly due to an increase of  in leasing license s commissions and an increase of  in commissions received by our insurance subsidiary  euroseguros 
another component of noninterest income is the net loss on sale of non hedging derivatives 
during the year ended december   net noninterest income reflected a  net loss on non hedging derivatives on which hedge accounting had been discontinued 
the net loss during reflects a million charge to earnings in the first quarter of for net losses on non hedging derivatives on which hedge accounting had been discontinued and a  gain on such derivatives in the second quarter of the derivatives were assumed in connection with the acquisition of banktrust in may gain on the sale of loans and leases of  was the second largest source of noninterest income in  as compared to million in  and million in income from gain on sale of loans and leases as a percentage of total noninterest income was  and in  and  respectively 
this source of noninterest income is derived primarily from the sale of lease financing contracts and mortgage loans 
during september and march  we sold lease financing contracts on a limited recourse basis to a third party with carrying values of million and million  respectively 
during november and june  we sold lease financing contracts on a limited recourse basis to a third party with carrying values of million  in each month  and million in december during  the decrease of  in the gain on sale of loans was mainly attributable to the lower yields on the loans sold during the year as compared to those sold in the decrease of million in the gain on sale of loans during was mainly attributable to the lower volumes of sales and  in part  to the lower yields on the loans sold during the year as compared to those sold in we retained servicing responsibilities for the lease financing contracts sold 
we surrendered control of the lease financing receivables  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  and accounted for these transactions as sales  recognizing net gains of approximately  for the september sale   for the march sale   for the november sale  million for the june sale and million for the december sale 
while the estimated losses on the limited recourse obligations assumed in the sale of our lease financing contracts is not significant  we established an allowance of  in september   on march    on november    on june  and  on december  and have included such estimates in the other liabilities section of our balance sheets for the years ended december  and also  during  we sold million in mortgage loans to other financial institutions  compared to million during  and million in september we did not retain the servicing rights on these mortgage loans and we accounted for this transaction as a sale  resulting in a gain of approximately   and  for those same periods 
in addition  during  we sold million in mortgage and consumer loans  which were acquired from banktrust and serviced by another entity 
we accounted for this transaction as a sale resulting in a gain of approximately  during  we recognized a  loss on sale of million in us treasury obligations available for sale  which were sold in an effort to improve the yields of the available for sale securities portfolio 
in  there were no sale of investments and in we recorded a  gain on sale of million in investment securities available for sale 
our final component of net noninterest income is the net loss on the sale of our oreo  repossessed assets and other assets 
we experienced net losses in this component of million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net loss on the sale of our oreo  repossessed assets and other assets increased by  or  in and decreased by  or  in the increase in was attributable primarily to an increased volume of losses in our lease financing portfolio as we experienced an unexpected increase in the number of repossessed vehicles resulting from the impairment of certain leases in our automobile leasing portfolio  which created net losses on the sale of repossessed automobiles and equipment totaling   and  for the years  and  respectively 
also  as our volume of lease financing contracts has increased  in order to avoid building up our inventory of repossessed automobiles  we have been more aggressive in our disposition efforts  mainly in the last quarter of in  the loss on the sale of oreo as a percentage of the loan balance at the date of repossession was over nine properties sold with a book value of approximately million  while in  it was over three properties sold with a book value of approximately  there were no losses on the sale of oreo for in  the decrease in the net loss on the sale of our oreo  repossessed assets and other assets was mainly due to our decision to evaluate in a more aggressive way our repossessed assets  which increased charge offs at the date of repossession 
noninterest expense the following tables set forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  amount amount amount dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment professional services  including directors fees office supplies other real estate owned and other repossessed assets expenses promotion and advertising lease expenses insurance municipal and other taxes commissions and service fees credit and debit cards other noninterest expense total noninterest expense reclassifications decreasing loan interest income with corresponding equal decreases in salaries and employee benefits have been made in the amount of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  to conform with this year s presentation 
our total noninterest expense increased to million in  from million in and million in this represents a year over year increase in noninterest expense of for and for these increases can be primarily attributed to the expanded personnel and occupancy costs associated with our business growth  our acquisition of banktrust  and the recent opening of our four new branch offices aguadilla and can vanas in december and september  respectively  hatillo in march and mayag ez in september 
our expansion of various groups  including eurolease and our trust and wealth management group  also contributed to the increase in our total noninterest expense 
noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets slightly changed to in  from in  and from in our efficiency ratio was in  from in  and from in we anticipate that the overall volume of our noninterest expense will continue to increase as we grow 
however  we remain committed to controlling costs and efficiency and expect to moderate these increases relative to our revenue growth 
salaries and employee benefit expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was mainly attributable to an increase of approximately million in salary adjustments and expanded personnel for business growth  an increase of approximately  related to employees benefits and activities  and an increase of approximately  resulting from two new branches opened at aguadilla and can vanas  puerto rico 
the increase in salary adjustments and expanded personnel for business growth is net of a  decrease in expenses deferred as loan origination costs when compared to previous year 
salaries and employee benefit expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was mainly attributable to an increase of approximately million resulting from our banktrust acquisition  an increase of approximately  in salary adjustments and expanded personnel for business growth  an increase of approximately  related to employees benefits and activities  and an increase of approximately  resulting from a new branch opening at hatillo  puerto rico 
the increase in salary adjustments and expanded personnel for business growth is net of a million increase in expenses deferred as loan origination costs when compared to previous year 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was mainly attributable to an increase of approximately  related to new premises for support departments  an increase of approximately  related to property taxes on branches  leasehold improvements and other real estate owned  an increase of  resulting from new branch openings  and an increase of approximately  in occupancy expenses related to business growth in the lease financing and trust departments 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased to million in  from million in this increase was mainly attributable to an increase of approximately  in occupancy expenses related to business growth in lease financing and construction and mortgage lending  an increase of approximately  resulting from new branch openings  and an increase of approximately  related to support departments  and an increase of approximately  resulting from our banktrust acquisition 
professional and directors fees were million  million and million  or  and of total noninterest expenses  in  and  respectively 
these increases are attributable primarily to the growth of our business and also to legal  audit  consulting and professional fees related to our capital raising efforts  acquisitions  becoming a publicly traded company  the implementation costs of sarbanes oxley act section compliance regarding management s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting  and our other actions to implement our strategic plan 
office supplies expenses were million  million and  or  and of our total noninterest expenses  in  and  respectively 
these increases are attributable primarily to the expansion of our branch network and franchise 
our expenses related to oreo and repossessed assets were million  or and of total noninterest expense in and  respectively  and  or of total noninterest expenses in this increase is attributable primarily to the increase in repossessed assets as previously mentioned 
repossessed assets are initially recorded at the lower of fair value or book value upon repossession and resulting losses are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
these assets are periodically evaluated and any subsequent decline in the fair value is charged to current operations 
insurance expenses were million   and  or of our total noninterest expense in and of our total noninterest expense in and  respectively 
increases in insurance expenses are attributable primarily to the expansion of our branch network  becoming a publicly traded company and our general organic growth 
municipal and other taxes increased to million  from million in  and  in these increases are directly attributable to our organic growth and our acquisition of banktrust in may commissions and service fees on credit and debit cards increased to million  from million in  and million in this increase is attributable primarily to the increase in the size of our commercial loan portfolio  which provides us with merchant point of sale business 
other noninterest expenses also increased annually during the prior three year period  however  these increases were related in large part to our asset growth over this period and increased expenses in our leasing business 
for and  the other noninterest expense included a charge off of  related to an insurance claim still on litigation and  related to an income tax deficiency  respectively 
during  due in part to management s commitment to overhead control  these expense increases were significantly outpaced by our revenue growth rate 
provision for income taxes puerto rico income tax law does not provide for the filing of a consolidated tax return  therefore  the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated income statement is the sum of our income tax expense and the income tax expenses of our individual subsidiaries 
our revenues are generally not subject to us federal income tax 
income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying our current tax rate to taxable income 
the deferred tax expense benefit reflects the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
for the year ended december   we recorded an million income tax expense  as compared to million in  and million in current income tax expense decreased to million in  from million in and million in  representing a decrease of in and an increase of in the decrease in was due to the decrease of in our income before taxes  which was primarily due to an increase in our exempt income as a percentage of total income 
furthermore  our income tax provision is lower than a provision based on the statutory tax rate applicable to eurobank  which is  because we have interest income from certain investments that is exempt from puerto rico income tax 
exempt interest relates mostly to interest earned on securities held by ebs overseas  our international banking entity subsidiary 
the increase in was due to the increase in our income before taxes of  but primarily due to a decrease in our exempt income as a percentage of total income 
at december    and  we had net deferred tax assets of million  million  and million  respectively 
the net decrease of million in our deferred tax asset during was mainly due to the utilization of the net operating losses acquired from banktrust in may and banco financiero in december  as further explained below 
the net increase of million during was mainly due to an increase of million in our deferred tax asset offset by an increase of million in our deferred tax liability 
the increment in the deferred tax assets was mainly due to the tax effect of the net operating losses acquired from banktrust and the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the increment in our deferred tax liability was mainly due to the increase in the deferred loan costs  the servicing assets and the loans market value allowance 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
in order to fully realize the deferred tax asset that resulted from our acquisitions of banco financiero and banktrust  we will need to generate future taxable income of approximately  and million related to their operations  respectively  prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards through years and  respectively 
such operations yielded approximately million of taxable income during and considering economies of scale to be achieved from the mergers and projected future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of these deductible differences at december  will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
please refer to note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
on august   the governor of puerto rico approved and signed law no 
 which imposes an additional transitory tax of on taxable income 
this additional tax increases the maximum statutory tax rate from to and is applicable to all corporations and partnerships with taxable income in excess of  during the taxable years beginning after december  and ending on or before december  this change in rate resulted in an increase of  in the income tax expense for the year ended december   comprised of an increase in current tax expense of  and a  estimated deferred tax benefit 
in addition  on august   the governor of puerto rico submitted to the puerto rico legislature a proposal to impose an additional transitory tax of on net interest income applicable to puerto rico financial institutions 
if approved  this additional tax will be effective for the taxable years and the proposal excludes from the definition of net interest income  exempt net interest earned on obligations of the united states  of any state or territory of the united states or political subdivision  of the district of columbia  and of the commonwealth of puerto rico or any instrumentality or political subdivision 
the final impact of this proposal will depend on the final bill  if approved  the actual distribution of taxable and exempt income  and the regulations issued thereafter 
extraordinary gain on acquisition of banktrust on may   we acquired all of the capital stock of banktrust 
the estimated fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed exceeded the purchase price by approximately million 
this was allocated to eliminate the fair value of intangible assets acquired  and the value of the furniture  fixtures and equipment acquired 
since all other remaining assets were either financial assets  assets to be disposed of in the near term or prepaid assets  the remaining negative goodwill amounting to million resulted in an extraordinary gain on the acquisition 
as established by the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  we have an allocation period of one year from the consummation date to identify and measure the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination 
consequently  the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired could be subject to revision based on the outcome of any future evaluations of these assets and liabilities

investment securities our investment portfolio primarily serves as a source of interest income and  secondarily  as a source of liquidity and a management tool for our interest rate sensitivity 
we manage our investment portfolio according to a written investment policy implemented by our asset liability management committee 
our investment policy is reviewed at least annually by our board of directors 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and our interest rate risk management objectives 
our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting our anticipated funding needs 
our investment portfolio mainly consists of securities classified as available for sale and a small portion of securities we intend to hold until maturity  or held to maturity securities 
the carrying values of our available for sale securities are adjusted for unrealized gain or loss as a valuation allowance  and any gain or loss is reported on an after tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income loss

during the past few years  we positioned our investment portfolio for an increase in interest rates by purchasing mostly investments with maturities or estimated maturities between to years 
during  we have seen higher interest in the short term of the curve and we have been able to reinvest at higher yields and for maturities or estimated maturities from years to years 
as of december   after above mentioned transactions  the estimated average maturity was approximately years and the average yield was approximately 
as of december   investment securities having a carrying value of approximately million were pledged to secure borrowings and deposits of public funds and to comply with other pledging requirements

the significant increase in our loan and lease volume in and was the result of organic growth  but in  it was largely impacted by our acquisition of banktrust  in which we acquired million of loans and leases 
our total loans and leases  net of unearned income as a percentage of total assets  remained at as of december  and  and decreased from in during  our growth in other assets  such as our investment securities  outpaced the growth of our loan and lease portfolio 
real estate secured loans  the largest component of our loan and lease portfolio  consist primarily of commercial real estate loans and or commercial lines of credit that are extended to finance the purchase and or improvement of commercial real estate and or businesses thereon or for business working capital purposes 
the properties may be either owner occupied or for investment purposes 
our loan policy adheres to the real estate loan guidelines promulgated by the fdic in the policy provides guidelines including  among other things  review of appraised value  limitation on loan to value ratio  and minimum cash flow requirements to service debt 
loans secured by real estate equaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the volume of our real estate loans has increased significantly as a result of our organic growth and as a result of our acquisition of banktrust in  on which we acquired real estate loans totaling million 
real estate secured loans  excluding real estate secured construction loans  as a percentage of total loans and leases increased to in  from and for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
lease financing contracts  the second largest component of our loan portfolio  consist of automobile and equipment leases made to individuals and corporate customers 
in the last three years  we have deemphasized equipment leasing and focused on automobile leasing 
for  approximately of our lease financing contracts originations were for new automobiles  approximately were for used automobiles and the remaining consisted primarily of construction and medical equipment leases 
the volume of our lease financing contracts increased to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively

all lease contracts were sold on a limited recourse basis 
the recourse on lease contracts sold in september is limited to a maximum of of the outstanding aggregate principal balance at the selling date of all leases sold 
the recourse on lease contracts sold in or before march is limited to a maximum of of the outstanding aggregate principal balance of all leases sold at repossession date 
other commercial and industrial loans include revolving lines of credit as well as term business loans 
commercial and industrial loans increased to million as of december  from million in  and from million in the significant increase in commercial and industrial loans in and was due to our organic growth  but in  it was mainly attributable to our acquisition of banktrust 
commercial and industrial loans as a percentage of total loans were  and at the end of  and  respectively 
consumer loans have historically represented a small part of our total loan and lease portfolio 
the majority of consumer loans consist of personal installment loans  credit cards  boat loans  and consumer lines of credit 
we make consumer loans only to complement our commercial business  and these loans are not emphasized by our branch managers 
as a result  repayment on this portfolio has generally exceeded or equaled origination  except for and  when we acquired consumer loans in connection with our acquisition of banktrust and banco financiero  respectively 
in the acquisition  we acquired consumer loans totaling million  including a million boat financing portfolio  and million  respectively 
consumer loans increased to million as of december  from million in  and from million in consumer loans as a percentage of total loans and leases were  and at the end of  and  respectively 
construction loans are not a significant part of our total loan portfolio 
construction loans totaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
construction loans as a percentage of total loans and leases were  and for those same periods  respectively 
during and  the volume of our construction loans has increased as a result of our growth  but in  primarily as the result of our acquisition of banktrust  on which we acquired construction loans totaling million 
our loan terms vary according to loan type 
commercial term loans generally have maturities of three to five years  while we generally limit real estate loan maturities to five to eight years 
lines of credit  in general  are extended on an annual basis to businesses that need temporary working capital and or import export financing 
leases are offered for terms up to months 
the following table shows our maturity distribution of loans and leases  including loans held for sale of  as of december   excluding non accrual loans amounting to million as of the same date 
a significant part of our non consumer loan portfolio is floating rate loans which comprise both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans 
by contrast  residential mortgage loans originated by eurobank are fixed rate 
residential mortgage loans are included in the real estate secured category in the following table 
as of december  over year through years over years one year or less fixed rate floating or adjustable rate fixed rate floating or adjustable rate total in thousands real estate construction real estate secured other commercial and industrial consumer leases other loans total maturities are based upon contract dates 
demand loans are included in the one year or less category and totaled million as of december  nonperforming loans  leases and assets nonperforming assets consist of loans and leases on nonaccrual status  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest  loans that have been restructured resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  oreo  and other repossessed assets 
the following table sets forth the amounts of nonperforming assets net of the portion guaranteed by the united states government as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands loans contractually past due days or more but still accruing interest nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned other repossessed assets total nonperforming assets nonperforming loans to total loans and leases nonperforming assets to total loans and leases plus repossessed property nonperforming assets to total assets we continually review present and estimated future performance of the loans and leases within our portfolio and risk rate such loans in accordance with a risk rating system 
more specifically  we attempt to reduce the exposure to risks through reviewing each loan request and renewal individually  utilizing a centralized approval system for loans in excess of  for secured loans and  for unsecured loans  strictly adhering to written loan policies  and conducting an independent credit review 
in addition  loans based on short term asset values are monitored on a monthly or quarterly basis 
in general  we receive and review financial statements of borrowing customers on an ongoing basis during the term of the relationship and respond to any deterioration noted 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become days past due  unless we believe the loan is adequately collateralized and we are in the process of collection 
the nonrecognition of interest income on an accrual basis does not constitute forgiveness of the interest  and collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status  resulting in an inability to meet the original repayment terms  and when we believe the borrower will eventually overcome financial difficulties and repay the loan in full 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans and leases that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on a cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual status 
the nonperforming loans and leases decreased to million as of december   from million as of december  and increased by million  from million as of december  as of december   nonaccrual loans acquired from banktrust amounted to million 
the ratio of nonperforming loans and leases over total loans and leases decreased to as of december   from and as of december  and  respectively 
we believe all loans and leases  with which we have serious doubts as to collectibility  are classified within the category of nonperforming loans and leases and are appropriately reserved 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means and that management intends to offer for sale 
other repossessed assets are comprised of repossessed automobiles  boats and equipment subject to lease contracts 
oreo and repossessed assets are initially recorded at the lower of fair value or book value 
any resulting loss is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
an appraisal of oreo and valuation of repossessed assets is made periodically after a property is acquired  and a comparison between the appraised value and the carrying value is performed 
additional declines in value after acquisition  if any  are charged to current operations 
gains or losses on disposition of oreo and repossessed assets  and related operating income and maintenance expenses  are included in current operations 
as of december   our oreo consisted of properties with an aggregate value of million  compared to properties with an aggregate value of million as of december   and properties valued at million as of december  other repossessed assets as of december  were million and million as of december  and the increase in repossessed assets during was in part attributable to increases in volumes of our automobile lease originations  but primarily related to the deterioration of our lease portfolio  mainly during the last quarter of  which resulted in a more aggressive repossession approach by our collection department 
together with oreo  the ratio of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and leases plus repossessed property improved to as of december  from and as of december  and  respectively 
allowance for loan and lease losses we have established an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  monthly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments and the unallocated allowance 
when analyzing the adequacy of our allowance  our portfolio is segmented into as many components as practical 
although the evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance focuses on loans and leases and pools of similar loans and leases  no part of our allowance is segregated for  or allocated to  any particular asset or group of assets 
our allowance is available to absorb all credit losses inherent in our portfolio 
each component would normally have similar characteristics  such as classification  type of loan or lease  industry or collateral 
as needed  we separately analyze the following components of our portfolio and provide for them in our allowance credit quality  sufficiency of credit and collateral documentation  proper lien perfection  appropriate approval by the loan officer and the loan committees  adherence to any loan agreement covenants  and compliance with internal policies and procedures and laws and regulations 
the general portion of our allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to all categories of loans and leases outstanding in our portfolio 
we use historic loss rates determined over a period of years 
the resulting loss factors are then multiplied against the current period s balance of loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
we adjust the historical loss percentage for each pool of loans to reflect any current conditions that are expected to result in loss recognition 
factors that we consider include  but are not limited to effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures  including those for underwriting  collection  charge offs  and recoveries  changes in the experience  ability and depth of our lending management and staff  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio  levels of  and trends in  delinquencies  net charge offs and nonaccruals  and national and local economic business trends and conditions 
historical loss rates are reviewed and adjusted for the above factors on a pool by pool basis 
rates for each pool are based on those factors management believes are applicable to that pool 
when applied to a pool of loans or leases  the adjusted historical loss rate is a measure of the total inherent losses in the portfolio that would have been estimated if each individual loan or lease had been reviewed 
in addition to our general portfolio allowances  specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a credit that management believes indicate a high probability that a loss will be incurred 
this amount may be determined either by a method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  or by a method that identifies certain qualitative factors 
through periodic management review at branch and executive level and utilization of internal delinquency processes  both portfolios and individual loans and leases are monitored on an ongoing basis 
when considered appropriate  a specific allowance will be considered on individual loan or lease accounts 
a review is generally conducted of all the conditions surrounding any particular account such as the borrower s character  existing and potential financial condition  realizable value of collateral  prospects for additional collateral and payment record 
as a result  the loss potential is determined and specific allowances may be established 
the level of allowance will vary depending on the analysis but we utilize the same classification categories as federal regulators  which result in varying amounts of allowance depending on loss potential 
the unallocated portion of the allowance contains amounts that are based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the unallocated portion of the allowance include the following general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  then existing economic and business conditions of areas outside the lending areas  such as other sections of the united states and caribbean  credit quality trends  including trends in nonperforming loans and leases expected to result from existing conditions  loan and lease concentrations by collateral and by obligor  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  bank regulatory examination results and guidance  and findings of our internal and external loan review examiners 
our loan review officer reviews these conditions on an ongoing basis in discussion with our executive management  senior lenders and credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as a specific allowance  applicable to such loan or portfolio segment 
when any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem loan or portfolio segment  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to such conditions is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance 
as mentioned above  our methodology for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired loans is based on classifications of loans into various categories and loss percentages that are commonly used for regulatory purposes 
for non classified loans  the estimated allowance is based on historical loss experiences as adjusted for changes in trends and conditions on an annual basis 
these trends are monitored to prevent possible deviations from the loss factors used for the methodology 
in connection with our ongoing evaluation and testing activities under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related rules and regulations  we have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making our assessment of internal control over financial reporting  we are using the criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
based on the criteria established in coso  we concluded that certain conditions exist which constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  as part of our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over the allowance for loan and lease losses adequacy  we identified several deficiencies  which when evaluated in the aggregate  were considered a material weakness 
such deficiencies are related to controls over certain aspects of the monitoring and documentation of recent loss trends of portfolios  the segregation of portfolios for purposes of the calculations of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  and the documentation of the unallocated portion of the allowance 
as a result of the material weakness  we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december  notwithstanding the foregoing  the financial information that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k has been adjusted to properly account for recent loss trends and conditions 
an adjustment to the allowance for loan and lease losses in the amount of million million net of taxes was recorded prior to the issuance of the company s financial statements as of december  in addition  we have commenced a remediation process post year end and intend to improve and remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
for additional information concerning this material weakness  see the item a 
controls and procedures 
although our management believes that the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans and leases that may become uncollectible  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
the table below summarizes  for the periods indicated  loan and lease balances at the end of each period  the daily averages during the period  changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses arising from loans and leases charged off  recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off  and additions to the allowance  and certain ratios related to the allowance for loan and lease losses year ended december  dollars in thousands average total loans and leases outstanding during period total loans and leases outstanding at end of period  including loans held for sale allowance for loan and lease losses allowance at beginning of period charge offs real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer leases other loans total charge offs year ended december  dollars in thousands recoveries real estate secured commercial and industrial consumer leases other loans total recoveries net loan and lease charge offs provision for loan and lease losses allowance of acquired bank banktrust and banco financiero allowance at end of period ratios net loan and lease charge offs to average total loans allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans at end of period net loan and lease charge offs to allowance for loan losses at end of period net loan and lease charge offs to provision for loan and lease losses the rapid growth of our loan and lease portfolio in the past five years required an increased allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by  or  to million at december   as compared to million as of december   and increased by  or million  as compared to december  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases decreased to at the end of year from in  and increased from in in addition  loan portfolio growth during the year has been mostly concentrated in commercial loans secured by real estate  on which the loss risk is less than in the other loan categories 
the increase in was mainly related to our acquisition of banktrust and also reflects our decision to amend our credit policy to charge off a portion of our lease finance contracts that are over days past due and to fully charge off most of our lease contracts that are over days past due 
in connection with our banktrust acquisition  we acquired million of additional allowance for loan and lease losses 
we consider that the allowance for loan and lease losses  which is of total loans and leases at december   is adequate to absorb probable losses in the portfolio 
in march  we commenced the practice of effecting partial charge off on all lease finance contracts that were over days past due 
this is done based on our historical lease loss experience 
for  we used a historical loss ratio in lease finance contracts of approximately 
this partial charge off is made on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  all lease finance contracts that are over days past due at the end of the quarter are partially charged off 
as of december   million was charged off for this purpose 
in june  we commenced the practice of charging off most of our lease finance contracts that were over days past due 
this charge off is made on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  most of our lease finance contracts that are over days past due at the end of the quarter are fully charged off 
for the year december   million was charged off for this purpose 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was  and at the end of year  and  respectively 
the increase in this ratio for and was attributable to increased volumes in the loan and lease portfolio  in part due to our acquisition of banktrust in may  our decision to fully charge off our lease finance contracts that are over days past due  and the deterioration of our lease portfolio  mainly during the last quarter of net charge offs as a percentage of provision for loan and lease losses decreased to as of december   from in  and increased from in during  the decrease of this ratio was mainly as a direct result of the increase in our provision for loan and lease losses to account for the recent loss trends in the leasing portfolio as previously mentioned 
the increase in this ratio for was mainly attributable to our acquisition of banktrust and our decision to fully charge off most of our lease finance contracts that are over days past due 
net charge offs for the year ended december  were million  compared to million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net charge offs for the year ended december  from the year ended december  was distributed as follows i million increase in net charge offs from consumer loans  ii million increase in net charge offs from commercial and industrial loans  and iii million increase in net charge offs from our leasing portfolio mainly as a result of an increase in the repossessed vehicles inventory 
during  the increase in net charge offs from consumer loans and in the commercial and industrial loans portfolio included million and  related to marine and commercial loans acquired from banktrust  respectively  for which adequate allowances were previously established 
also  during  the commercial and industrial charge offs included the unsecured portions of a loan granted to a computer retailing company amounting to  and  related to a loan granted to a construction company  respectively 
during  the commercial and industrial charge offs included the unsecured portion of a loan granted to a construction company amounting to  net charge offs as a percentage of our year end portfolio balance  or net loss experience  has averaged for our commercial loan portfolio that is not secured by real estate over the past three years 
over the same period  we have experienced no net losses for our commercial loan portfolio secured by real estate 
however  because a significant portion of our business is focused on commercial lending  we have generally maintained a conservative allowance for our commercial loan portfolio 
for the portion of our commercial loan portfolio adequately secured with real estate collateral  we maintain an allowance equal to of the outstanding balance of such portfolio 
the allowance for commercial loans that are not secured by real estate is equal to of the outstanding portfolio balance 
our consumer installment closed end loan portfolio has averaged a net loss experience over the past five years 
this is partially attributable to the fact that  in connection with our acquisitions of other banks  additional charge offs have been recorded and additional allowances have been built into the transaction pricing to compensate for future losses 
for our consumer loan portfolio we maintain an allowance equal to of the outstanding balance of such portfolio 
our five year old construction loan portfolio has no loss experience 
nevertheless  we maintain an allowance for this portfolio equal to of the portfolio balance 
our leasing portfolio has a net loss experience over the last year 
we maintain an allowance equal to of the balance of this portfolio 
the mortgage portfolio has no loss experience 
the large majority of mortgage originations are sold to other financial institutions and the existing portfolio is generally of a mature nature 
nevertheless  we maintain an allowance equal to of the mortgage portfolio 
on may   eurobank acquired loan portfolios from banktrust totaling million with accompanying general  specific and unallocated allowances of million 
because a number of banktrust s problem loans were acquired by a special purpose vehicle immediately prior to closing  and as a result of a series of charge offs performed prior to the closing  except with regard to the acquired boat financing portfolio described below  we determined that the portfolios acquired from banktrust generally had a risk level comparable to our portfolio prior to the banktrust transaction 
consequently  we continued to apply the same allowance guidelines used to our portfolio 
the only major loan category acquired from banktrust not previously marketed by eurobank was banktrust s boat financing portfolio  which amounted to million as of december  as with all other banktrust consumer loans  the special purpose vehicle assumed all loans in the banktrust boat financing portfolio that were more than days delinquent 
in the six months prior to its acquisition  banktrust maintained a boat financing allowance between and of the outstanding portfolio 
we currently maintain a  allowance on the boat financing portfolio  or of the outstanding portfolio 
the table below presents an allocation for loan and lease losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans and leases in each category to gross loans or leases

the decrease in now and money market accounts  savings accounts  and other time deposits in denominations of less than  was mainly due to the fierce competition for core deposits on the island 
accordingly  in order to take advantage of historically low funding costs  we increased brokered deposits to million  million and million as of december   and  respectively

the federal reserve board indicated in supervisory letter sr the supervisory letter  dated july   that trust preferred securities will be treated as tier capital until notice is given of the contrary 
the supervisory letter also indicates that the federal reserve will review the regulatory implications of any accounting treatment changes and will provide further guidance if necessary or warranted 
on march  the federal reserve board adopted the final rule that allows the continued limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies bhcs 
under the final rule  trust preferred securities and other restricted core capital elements would be subject to stricter quantitative limits 
the federal reserve board s final rule limits restricted core capital elements to of all core capital elements  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
internationally active bhcs  defined as those with consolidated assets greater than billion or on balance sheet foreign exposure greater than billion  will be subject to a limit 
but they may include qualifying mandatory convertible preferred securities up to the generally applicable limit 
amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of these limits generally may be included in tier capital 
the final rule provides a five year transition period  ending march   for application of the quantitative limits 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and or future prospects 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital

as of december   we and eurobank both qualified as well capitalized institutions under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
for this purpose the bank choose to maintain a minimum target liquidity referred as core basis surplus and defined as the portion of the bank s funds maintained in short term investments and other marketable assets  less the liabilities portions secured by any of these assets to cover a portion of time deposits maturing in days and a portion of the non maturity deposits  expressed as a percentage of total assets 
this core basis surplus number generally should be positive  but it may vary as our asset and liability committee decides to maintain a relatively large or small liquidity coverage  depending on its estimates of the general business climate  its expectations regarding the future course of interest rates in the near term  and the bank s current financial position 
two additional factors that will impact the magnitude of the core basic surplus target are the available borrowing capacity at the federal home loan bank fhlb  as represented by qualifying loans on the balance sheet that are not part of the calculation  and unused brokered time deposits capacity relative to the bank s related policy limit on acceptable levels of these deposits 
for this reason  current fhlb advance and brokered time deposits availability are part of the bank s liquidity presentation 
our liquid assets at december   and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our core basis surplus liquidity level was  and as of the same periods  respectively 
as a secondary source of liquidity  we rely on advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by qualified residential and commercial mortgage loans  and investment securities 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
other funding alternatives available are local and united states conventional and brokered time deposits  unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks  borrowing lines with brokers and the federal reserve bank of new york 
in order to participate in the broker time deposits market  we must be categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action unless we obtain a waiver from the federal deposit insurance corporation 
restrictions on our ability to participate in this market could place limitations on our growth strategy or could result in our participation in other more expensive funding sources 
our expansion strategies will have to be reviewed to reflect the possible limitation to funding sources and changes in cost structures 
we do not foresee any changes in our capital ratios that would restrict our ability to participate in the brokered deposit market 
our target core basis surplus liquidity ratio established in our asset liability management policy is or a positive surplus 
our liquidity demands are not seasonal and all trends have been stable over the last three years 
we are not aware of any trends or demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially impair our liquidity 
generally  financial institutions determine their target liquidity ratios internally  based on the composition of their liquidity assets and their ability to participate in different funding markets that can provide the required liquidity 
in addition  the local market has characteristics  which make it impossible to compare our liquidity needs and sources to the liquidity needs and sources of our peers in the rest of the nation 
after careful analysis of the diversity of liquidity sources available to us  our asset quality and the historic stability of our core deposits  we have determined that our target liquidity ratio is adequate 
in addition to the normal influx of liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  we utilize brokered and out of market certificates of deposit  fhlb borrowings and broker dealer repurchase agreements to meet our liquidity needs 
the fhlb borrowings are collateralized by first mortgage residential loans  selected investment securities and fhlb stock 
pre approved repurchase agreement availability with major brokers and banks totaled million at december   subject to acceptable unpledged marketable securities available for sale 
in addition  eurobank is able to borrow from the federal reserve bank using securities as collateral 
eurobank also maintains pre approved overnight borrowing lines at various correspondent banks  which provided additional short term borrowing capacity of million at december  during  asset growth was funded primarily with growth in deposits

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessary move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services since such prices are affected by inflation 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by eurobank s board of directors and carried out by eurobank s asset liability management committee 
the asset liability management committee s objectives are to manage our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding  investment security purchase and sale strategies and mortgage loan sales  as well as derivative financial instruments 
eurobank may enter into interest rate swap agreements  in which it exchanges the periodic payments  based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and variable interest rates 
at december   the bank had interest rate swap agreements which converted million of fixed rate time deposits to variable rate time deposits of which million will mature between and and million between and but with semi annual call options which match call options on the swaps 
for more detail on derivative financial instruments please refer to note derivative financial instruments of the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  using the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of the bank s existing assets and liabilities  including off balance sheet financial instruments 
net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing and relationship between various interest rates 
at december   we modeled rising ramp and declining interest rate simulations in basis point increments over a month period 
the impact of imbedded options in such products as callable and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans and callable borrowings were considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
the asset liability management committee utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
in the december  simulation  our model indicated an exposure in the level of net interest income to rising rates for a month period 
the hypothetical rate scenarios consider a change of and basis points during a month period 
the decreasing rate scenarios have a floor of basis points 
this floor causes liabilities to have little cost reduction  while assets do have a decrease in yields 
as of december   our gap position is slightly liability sensitive  causing a small loss in increasing rate simulations of and basis points 
at december   the net interest income at risk for year one in the basis point falling rate scenario was calculated at  or higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario  and million  or  higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at the december  simulation with a basis point decrease 
these exposures are well within our policy guidelines of 
at december   the net interest income for year one in the basis point rising rate scenario was calculated to be  or  lower than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario  and  million  or  lower than the net interest income in the rate unchanged scenario at the december  simulation with a basis point increase 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan and security prepayments  deposit run offs and pricing and reinvestment strategies and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios as of december  change in future net interest income at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year basis points over one year basis points over one year we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing 
the following table sets forth  on a stand alone basis  eurobank s amounts of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and the nominal amount of interest rate swaps outstanding at december   which we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  we cannot assure you that assumed repricing rates will approximate our actual future deposit activity 
as of december  volumes subject to repricing within days days days years over years non interest sensitive total dollars in thousands assets short term investments and federal funds sold investment securities and fhlb federal reserve bank stock loans fixed and other assets total assets liabilities and stockholders equity interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts certificates of deposit borrowed funds other liabilities total swaps stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities n a certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the earnings at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor core funding utilization in each interest rate scenario as well as market value of equity 
these measures are used to evaluate long term interest rate risk beyond the two year planning horizon 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table represents our on and off balance sheet aggregate contractual obligations  other than deposit liabilities  to make future payments to third parties as of the date specified as of december  less than one year one year to three years over three years to five years over five years in thousands fhlb advances notes payable to statutory trusts operating leases total off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these commitments  which have a term of less than one year  represent a credit risk and are not represented in any form on our balance sheets 
as of december   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million and million  respectively 
these commitments included standby letters of credit of million  million and million for december   and  respectively  and commercial letters of credit of million  million and  for those same periods  respectively 
starting in the fiscal year  in accordance with fin  it is our policy to recognize the estimated fair value of our obligations under standby letters of credit issued  which are then reduced by credits to earnings as we are released from the stand ready risk 
however  at december   no obligation was recorded since the amounts were inconsequential 
the effect on our revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity of the unused portions of these commitments cannot reasonably be predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used

this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
this statement addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
sop does not apply to loans originated by the entity 
sop limits the yield that may be accreted accretable yield to the excess of the investor s estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected over the investor s initial investment in the loan 
sop requires that the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected nonaccretable difference not be recognized as an adjustment to yield  loss accrual  or valuation allowance 
sop prohibits investors from displaying accretable yield and nonaccretable difference in the balance sheet 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as impairment 
sop prohibits carrying over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of this statement 
the prohibition of the valuation allowance carryover applies to the purchase of an individual loan  a pool of loans  a group of loans  and loans acquired in a purchase business combination 
sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is encouraged 
the company elected to adopt sop for year ending december  the impact of the new accounting pronouncement cannot be reasonably estimated  as it is related to future loan acquisitions 
in march  the us securities and exchange commission released the staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments 
this bulletin informs registrants of the staff s view that the fair value of the recorded loan commitments should not consider the expected future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the future loan 
the provisions of sab no 
must be applied to loan commitments accounted for as derivatives that are entered into after march  the staff will not object to the application of existing accounting practices to loan commitments accounted for as derivatives that are entered into on or before march   with appropriate disclosures 
on april   the company adopted the provisions of sab no 
 which did not have an impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on the application on issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the eitf reached a consensus on the impairment model to be used to determine when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the impairment model also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
this impairment model is applicable for investments in debt and equity securities that are within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and equity securities that are not subject to the scope of sfas no 
and not accounted for under the equity method under apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  referred to in issue as the cost method investments 
the impairment model developed by the eitf to determine whether an investment is within the scope of issue involves a sequence of steps including the following step determine whether an investment is impaired 
if an impairment indicator is present  as determined in step  the investor should estimate the fair value of the investment 
if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost  proceed with step evaluate whether an impairment is other than temporary 
step if the impairment is other than temporary  recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
the impairment model described above used to determine other than temporary impairment was effective for reporting periods beginning after june  in september  the fasb delayed the requirements to record impairment losses under eitf until such time as new guidance is issued and comes into effect 
currently  the disclosure requirements originally prescribed by eitf will remain in effect 
on november   the fasb released fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the fsp addresses determining when an investment is considered impaired and whether that impairment is other than temporary  and measuring an impairment loss 
the fsp also addresses the accounting after an entity recognizes an other than temporary impairment  and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that the entity did not recognize as other than temporary impairments 
the fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  in december  the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  was revised 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this statement requires to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met  those conditions are much the same as the related conditions in sfas no 
an entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value 
under the sec s rule  approved on april  sfas no 
r will be effective  for public entities that do not file as small business issuers for annual  rather than interim periods that begin after june  the company expects to adopt this new implementation for the first quarter of this statement has an inconsequential impact on the company s financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  was issued in may this statement  which replaces accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  requires the retrospective application of a voluntary change in accounting principles or a change required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions  to prior period s financial statements  rather than recognizing the cumulative effect of the voluntary change in accounting principle in the net income of the period of the change 
the retrospective application is required unless it is impracticable to determine the specific period of the effect or the cumulative effect of the change 
under these instances  the new accounting principle should be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and the corresponding adjustments should be made to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position for that period 
furthermore  if it is also impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all periods  this statement establishes that the new accounting principle be applied as if it was adopted prospectively
