part i item business summary we are a global integrated healthcare company developing proprietary technologies in diagnostics and vaccinology 
we are dedicated to the commercialization of innovative products and services for healthcare providers  their patients and their communities 
on february   igen international  inc  which we refer to in this form k as igen  and roche consummated a merger and certain related transactions  which we refer to in this form k as the merger and related transactions  pursuant to which roche acquired igen and igen simultaneously distributed shares of our common stock to its stockholders 
the transaction occurred in the following steps igen restructured its operations so that we  a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of igen at the time  assumed igen s biodefense  life science and industrial product lines as well as igen s opportunities in the clinical diagnostics and healthcare fields and the ownership of igen s intellectual property  igen s equity interest in msd  cash and certain other rights and licenses currently held by igen  and a wholly owned subsidiary of roche merged with and into igen  as a result of which igen became a wholly owned subsidiary of roche and we became an independent  publicly traded company 
simultaneously with the completion of the merger  certain ongoing commercial agreements between certain affiliates of roche and us became effective 
diagnostics we develop  manufacture and market our m series r family of products  which can serve as a platform for diagnostic systems to be used for the detection and measurement of biological or chemical substances 
we incorporate our technologies into our instrument systems  tests and reagents  which are the biological and chemical components used to perform such tests 
using the m series platform  we intend to integrate technologies and products to develop small  expandable and modular systems that can perform a wide variety of tests for the following markets clinical diagnostics 
the clinical diagnostics market includes the testing of patient samples to measure the presence of disease and monitor medical conditions 
we are developing products to be used in the clinical diagnostics market and believe that our products will be ideally suited for the immunodiagnostic and nucleic acid testing market segments of the clinical testing market 
non clinical diagnostics for the biosecurity  life science and industrial markets 
the non clinical diagnostics market includes biosecurity products for the detection of bacteria  viruses and toxins that may pose a military or public health threat  life science testing for drug discovery and development that is performed by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and industrial testing for the detection of foodborne and waterborne disease causing pathogens 
we believe that the emergence of simple  more accurate and cost effective clinical diagnostic products is shifting the site of clinical diagnostic testing from clinical reference laboratories and central hospital laboratories to decentralized patient care centers  such as physicians offices  ambulatory clinics  hospital emergency rooms  surgical and intensive care units  hospital satellite laboratories and nurses stations  which are collectively referred to as clinical point of care sites 
our own product development efforts are focused on m series instruments and tests for the biosecurity market and for the clinical diagnostics market  particularly for point of care sites 
we are seeking to develop  market and sell products for the clinical point of care market segment through a combination of direct efforts and collaborative arrangements 
we also are pursuing opportunities in the clinical reference laboratory and central hospital laboratory market segments through collaborative arrangements 
the first clinical diagnostic system being developed by us is a clinical analyzer that builds on the m series instruments we sell in the biosecurity and life science markets 
we believe that the clinical analyzer will provide results to a physician rapidly with the same levels of sensitivity  accuracy or consistency as a large instrument in a clinical reference laboratory or in a central laboratory  thereby permitting the physician to make a more timely decision regarding the patient s course of treatment 
among the applications that we plan to develop is a proprietary approach for determining an individual s personal immune status through unique diagnostic panels 
we will seek approval from the fda for the clinical analyzer and other in vitro diagnostics products at the appropriate stage of their product development 
there can be no assurance that such approval will be obtained 
our m series instruments are used in biodefense programs for homeland security  including by the department of defense  or dod 
we believe there will be an increasing opportunity to sell our products as biosecurity tools for use by commercial  governmental and military organizations around the world  as well as in public health 
we are also selling two types of m series instruments for life science research to pharmaceutical and biotechnology researchers  as well as to scientists at academic and government research institutions 
immunogenicity testing is performed by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in order to characterize the ability of protein based therapeutics to stimulate an immune response 
antibodies that result from an immune response to a protein based drug can reduce its efficacy and cause significant side effects  such as allergic reactions 
because of serious side effects that have been reported over the last year  it has become increasingly necessary to determine if an immune response to protein based drugs develops in patients by screening for the presence of antibodies  confirming their specificity  characterizing the type of antibodies present and determining whether they interfere with binding events 
immunogenicity testing is done during pre clinical studies and may continue through the clinical trials required for regulatory approval 
in some cases  the fda requires additional testing after a drug has been approved 
we believe our m series product line for the life science market is ideally suited to perform immunogenicity testing by measuring low affinity antibodies with high sensitivity  all in the presence of the highly concentrated drug 
vaccines in fiscal  we expanded our business model to target the field of vaccines 
in connection with this effort  we have entered into the following license and option agreements an option agreement with children s hospital research center at oakland chrco for exclusive patent rights to a unique vaccine candidate for neisseria meningitidis serogroup b  which causes meningitis 
we believe that the availability of an effective vaccine that would prevent meningococcal serogroup b  for use by various population groups  could satisfy a significant unmet medical need 
an agreement with the national research council of canada nrc for a license to patent rights to candidates for a group b streptococcus gbs type ii and type v vaccine and a group b meningococcus gbm vaccine 
under the agreement with the nrc  we acquired worldwide  exclusive rights to commercialize products for possible use in the prevention  diagnosis and treatment of disease caused by gbs  a leading cause of sepsis  pneumonia  and meningitis among newborns 
we received similar worldwide rights  with the exclusion of canada  to nrc s gbm vaccine technologies for the prevention of meningococcal b meningitis and sepsis 
an agreement with the university of massachusetts at amherst uma for exclusive patent rights to a unique vaccine candidate for chlamydia  the most frequently reported infectious disease in the united states 
under the agreement with uma  we acquired exclusive rights to commercialize products for possible use in the prevention  diagnosis and treatment of all chlamydial infections  including the disease  chlamydia  caused by the bacterium  chlamydia trachomatis 
a technology license agreement with baxter healthcare corporation for exclusive patent rights to a broad portfolio of vaccine candidates 
vaccines covered by the agreement include those for the prevention of diseases caused by group a streptococci gas  gbs  pneumococci  gbm  anthrax bacilli and urinary tract infection uti associated with e coli 
under that agreement  we receive exclusive rights to patents or know how related to the manufacture  production  use and commercialization of the vaccine candidates 
a license agreement with the rockefeller university under which we receive an exclusive  worldwide license of patents and know how to manufacture  use and commercialize a unique vaccine candidate for gas  including pharmaceutical  therapeutic  diagnostic and vaccine applications thereof 
gas  also known as streptococcus pyogenes  causes a range of mild to severe diseases in both children and adults and there is currently no vaccine for this disease 
the technology from rockefeller university is based on the use of bacterial polysaccharide in a new vaccine to elicit protective antibodies  which we believe will complement our existing carbohydrate conjugate vaccine platform 
an agreement with theracarb  inc of edmonton  alberta for exclusive patent rights to a vaccine candidate for candida albicans  the most common fungal pathogen affecting humans 
under the agreement with theracarb  we acquired a first option for exclusive rights to commercialize products for possible use in the prevention  diagnosis and treatment of candida albicans infections 
candida albicans is the most common of the candida species  which are ubiquitous  opportunistic pathogens that colonize more than half of all healthy individuals in the us  causing systemic disease in nearly of those who are immunocompromised 
under these license and option agreements  the company paid certain upfront fees and may also make additional future payments for patent costs  milestone fees  including for initiating and completing human clinical trials and receiving regulatory approvals  and royalties on future sales 
in connection with our efforts to determine an individual s personal immune status through unique diagnostic test panels  we entered into a license and research agreement with jewish general hospital jgh in montreal under which we received an exclusive  worldwide license to the use of a jgh database that contains demographic data and the serologic status of an immigrant population linked to numerous infectious diseases

our strategy our strategy is based on the direct development and sale of products utilizing our technologies  while at the same time entering into collaborations with third parties that can assist us in product development  manufacturing and marketing efforts 
key elements of our strategy are to pursue collaborative relationships to accelerate new product development and enhance global manufacturing and marketing capabilities  establish leadership positions in emerging markets  develop and market product line extensions and an expanded menu of assays  and maximize high value added opportunities in vaccines 
our technology our m series family of products incorporate a number of technologies  including ecl technology developed and owned by us  various improvements to ecl technology developed by roche and licensed to us  polymerase chain reaction technology developed by roche and licensed to us for use in several specified markets  including the human and animal in vitro diagnostics markets  which we refer to in this form k as pcr technology  and in addition  we have rights to a portfolio of unique vaccine candidates 
ecl technology ecl technology is based on electrochemiluminescence that is protected by patents in the united states and internationally 
ecl technology permits the detection and measurement of a biological or chemical substance within a given sample 
it works by labeling the targeted substance within a sample using a compound and binding the newly labeled substance to magnetizable beads 
the beads can then be separated from the rest of the sample using a magnet 
when this newly labeled substance is stimulated  the label emits light at a particular wavelength 
the light emitted by the label can be measured with a high degree of accuracy 
the level of intensity of the light emitted by the label is determined by the amount of the targeted biological substance present in the sample for the label to attach itself to 
thus  the light emissions permit the accurate detection and measurement of the targeted biological or chemical substance 
ecl technology provides a uniform format that can be used to conduct a multitude of tests  including immunodiagnostic tests and nucleic acid tests 
the essential component of an ecl technology based system is the flow cell  which contains a magnet to separate the labeled substance from the sample being tested and a light detector to measure the electrochemiluminescence 
the flow cell has been designed so that it can be incorporated into a variety of instruments  ranging from large central laboratory random access systems to small batch systems 
we believe that the major features and benefits of ecl technology based systems are simplicity uniform testing format reduces time and labor in performing a test or series of tests and permits complete automation of the testing process 
flexibility enables a single instrument to perform immunodiagnostic tests on large and small molecules and to perform nucleic acid tests  including in the form of dna and rna tests 
cost reduces the cost per test by minimizing the amount of expensive reagents needed and the number of steps required to prepare a sample for testing 
speed reduces time from test set up to detection  producing rapid results and enabling high sample throughput 
sensitivity allows detection of targeted biological substances at very low concentrations 
consistency provides highly reproducible measurements 
accuracy provides results that are identical or close to the standard reference measurement 
stability extends the shelf life of the reagent that contains the label used in testing and improves measurement accuracy 
we believe that ecl technology is well suited for the continued development and sale of the m series family of instruments that can be used in all of our target diagnostic markets 
we believe the technology will permit immunodiagnostic and nucleic acid tests to be performed using the same detection method 
ecl technology is well established in the market  evidenced by the fact that our licensees have developed multiple product lines based on ecl technology 
there can be no assurance that we will succeed in profitably developing  marketing and selling products based on ecl technology 
improvements from roche as part of the merger and related transactions  we acquired from roche diagnostics and its affiliates an irrevocable  worldwide  non exclusive  fully paid  royalty free  perpetual license under certain patents covering technologies based on roche diagnostics ecl instruments and all aspects of ecl assays developed prior to the completion of the merger between roche and igen  certain pcr technology  and certain aspects of ecl technology and robotics used or developed prior to the completion of the merger between roche and igen 
the license  which we refer to in this form k as the improvements license agreement  may be used without a field restriction except as set forth in the next sentence to develop  make  reproduce  modify  use  sell and otherwise commercially exploit any product or service based on ecl technology 
in addition  we are licensed to use certain intellectual property rights of hitachi high technology corporation and its affiliates only outside the field defined in the improvements license agreement to develop  make  reproduce  modify  use  sell and otherwise commercially exploit any product or services based on ecl technology 
subject to an exception  the field in the improvements license agreement is the same as the field in the license agreement 
we may sublicense rights under both of these licenses to affiliates and third parties 
the improvements license agreement restricts our right to use such improvements in certain types of ecl products 
in addition  the license does not permit us to develop  use  manufacture or sell ecl assays that contain labeling that make them useable on ecl instruments manufactured  sold or placed by roche diagnostics or its licenses or resellers  in the field 
pcr technology pcr technology includes the amplification of specific nucleic acid sequences to a sufficient quantity of the nucleic acid sequence to permit detection and quantification 
the process of nucleic acid amplification is commonly used for diagnostic procedures involving infectious agents  such as the aids virus  because of the need to detect the smallest amount of virus possible in the blood or other clinical samples 
the pcr license agreements obtained by us from roche and its affiliates will allow us to develop nucleic acid tests for several specified markets  including the human and animal in vitro diagnostics markets 
we believe that nucleic acid tests are currently one of the fastest growing segments of the clinical diagnostics market and would complement our immunodiagnostic product line 
we do not currently sell any product based on the pcr technology licensed from roche
