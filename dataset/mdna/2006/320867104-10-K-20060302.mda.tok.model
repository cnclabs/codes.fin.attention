table of contents critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results of operations  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that its accounting policies with respect to the reserve for loan losses and income taxes are the accounting areas requiring subjective or complex judgments that are most important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies  as discussed below 
reserve for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of reserve for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s reserve for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses as well as its assessment of the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the reserve is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
income taxes the company accounts for income tax expense by applying an estimated effective tax rate to its pre tax income 
the effective tax rate is based on management s judgments and estimates regarding permanent differences in the treatment of specific items of income and expense for financial statement and income tax purposes 
in addition  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities  recorded in the consolidated statements of condition  based on management s judgments and estimates regarding temporary differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial statement and income tax purposes 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction or refund of taxes in future periods and establish a valuation allowance for those assets for which recovery is unlikely 
in making this assessment  management must make judgments and estimates regarding the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and the possible application of future tax planning strategies 
although the company has determined a valuation allowance is not required for any deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that these assets are recognizable

performance overview general overview compared with the company  through its banking network  provides a full range of both business and retail banking and trust and investment management services through banking offices  primarily in suburban metropolitan chicago 
the primary source of the company s revenue is net interest income  which represents the difference between interest and fees earned on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  and fees from financial services provided to customers 
business volumes tend to be influenced by overall economic factors including market interest rates  business spending  and consumer confidence  as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace 
the company s net income for increased on a per diluted share basis to million  or per diluted share  from net income of million  or per diluted share  in in  the company s return on average assets was as compared to in and its return on average equity was as compared to in the company s performance reflects continuing solid levels of profitability and credit quality as well as the benefits of growth in corporate lending and fee based business lines 
in comparison to  the company s net income benefited from growth in interest earning asset levels of million  which generated higher tax equivalent net interest income of million  lower provisions for loan losses of million  and increased fee based revenue of million 
partially offsetting these benefits were million in security losses  million in higher noninterest expense  lower income generated from the disposition of assets  and a higher effective tax rate 
the company s overall profitability continues to benefit from strong earnings  reflecting improving net interest income and noninterest income  solid credit quality  cost control  and efficient use of capital 
the company s total loans as of december  increased to billion  an increase of million as compared to december   as growth in corporate and real estate family lending offset declines in consumer lending 
corporate lending  representing commercial and industrial  real estate commercial  real estate construction  and agricultural lending categories  increased from december  total average deposits for were billion  an increase of as compared to  largely as the result of a increase in average time deposits 
average time deposits for in comparison to reflect the combined impact of targeted sales promotion and higher levels of brokered deposits 
the increase in time deposit balances was partially offset by decreases in savings  now  and money market balances as consumer preferences changed in response to the higher level of interest rates and time deposit promotion 
nonperforming assets as of december  totaled million  down from million as of december  as of december   nonperforming assets  including foreclosed real estate  represented of loans plus foreclosed real estate as compared to as of december  and near the company s historical low of as of june  loans past due days and still accruing totaled million as of december   down from million as of september  and up from million as of december  the increase in loans past due days primarily resulted from the transfer of a million loan in the process of collection to accruing status and a single million past due loan  which is fully secured by cash 
net charge offs for totaled million  or of average loans 
in comparison to full year  net charge offs declined by million  or 
as of december   the reserve for loan losses stood at of total loans as compared to as of december  
table of contents net losses realized from the company s securities portfolio totaled million in during the first quarter of  the company responded to changing market conditions and its continued expectation for higher interest rates by selling million in municipal securities and million in collateralized mortgage obligations  resulting in a gain of million 
security proceeds were reinvested in shorter term mortgage backed securities 
in december  the company announced its intent to sell approximately million of under performing mortgage backed securities  representing of the company s total securities portfolio 
as a result of this action  the company realized approximately million of pre tax security losses in fourth quarter as of december   of the projected sales of securities had been completed  and the proceeds were reinvested in longer term municipal securities 
the remaining million of targeted sales were completed in january with the proceeds used to temporarily reduce short term borrowings 
 in security gains was recognized in january relating to these sales 
the proceeds may subsequently be used to acquire higher interest yielding assets as market conditions warrant 
compared with the company s net income for increased on a per diluted share basis to million  or per diluted share  from net income of million  or per diluted share  in in  the company s return on average assets was as compared to in and its return on average equity was as compared to in in comparison to  the company s net income benefited from million higher interest earning asset levels  which generated higher tax equivalent net interest income of million  million higher net realized security gains  million lower losses resulting from extinguishment of debt  and improved fee revenue 
partially offsetting these benefits were million in higher provisions for loan losses  million in higher noninterest expense  and lower income generated from the disposition of assets 
the company s total loans of billion at december  increased from december  growth was influenced by two separate asset deployment decisions 
during the fourth quarter  the company converted million of its family residential mortgages into an investment security 
during  indirect consumer loans declined million  reflecting the company s decision in to cease the origination of new volumes from this marginally profitable business line 
excluding both family residential loans and indirect consumer loans  the company s total loans would have increased as commercial  agricultural  real estate commercial  and home equity consumer loan categories all grew 
commercial loans outstanding as of december  increased by compared to december  consumer home equity loans increased from december   reflecting sales success and targeted promotion 
total deposits as of december  totaled billion  up from december  demand and time deposit balances outstanding as of december  increased and  respectively  in comparison to  largely due to targeted sales efforts and consumer preferences 
the company s credit quality improved during nonperforming assets totaled million as of december   down from million as of december  as of december   the ratio of nonperforming assets plus days past due loans to total loans plus foreclosed real estate was  improving from as of december  during  the company completed the successful integration of covest bancshares  inc  a bank holding company in northwestern suburban cook county that the company acquired on december  the covest acquisition 
as a result  the company s average assets increased in by million over  while requiring only a minimal increase in back office support 
business outlook the synergies created by the company s activities put the company in a strong position to continue its forward momentum in the company s efforts in fourth quarter to modestly restructure the securities portfolio  tightly manage credit risk  and rationalize staffing costs  combined with favorable trends in deposit  corporate loans  and fee based business lines  should benefit performance 
in  the company will work to balance these benefits with the challenges of a flat interest rate yield curve that offers little prospect of reversing in the near term and a competitive response in the marketplace that remains vigorous 

table of contents performance will be impacted by the expensing of stock options and the anticipated acquisition of bank calumet early in the second quarter of the company is especially encouraged by the values inherent in the bank calumet franchise represented by a strong depository base coupled with a marketplace that has strong loan expansion potential 
the company expects earnings to be in the range of to per diluted share  including the estimated impact of the acquisition of bank calumet 
the company feels that it is well positioned for continued performance improvement because it operates in strong markets with favorable business fundamentals 
the company expects continued expansion in the markets it serves  which should generate a greater demand for the company s products and services 
the competition for bank products and services continues to intensify in the chicago metropolitan area as banks headquartered both within and outside of chicago have announced aggressive expansion plans 
the company continues to believe it can compete successfully because of the high quality of its products and services  its unique relationship based approach to banking  and its knowledge of and connections to the communities it serves 
overall performance is expected to benefit from increased net interest income due to higher interest earning asset levels funded by deposit acquisition and increased fee based revenue 
interest earning asset improvement should result from improved loan demand due to favorable trends in corporate lending and targeted pricing and promotion of home equity lending 
these benefits are likely to be offset by expected increases in noninterest expense 
net interest margin is anticipated to remain under short term pressure given the prolonged  flattened interest rate yield curve and the company s expectation of increasing interest rates 
in this environment  net interest margin pressure would result from a narrowing spread between repricing asset yields and deposit and borrowing costs 
the company s actual net interest margin performance will depend upon a number of factors  such as the growth in interest earning assets  the company s mix of assets and liabilities  the pace and timing of changes in interest rates  and the shape of the yield curve 
earnings performance net interest income net interest income represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of total interest earning assets 
the accounting policies underlying the recognition of interest income on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets are presented in notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
for purposes of this discussion  both net interest income and net interest margin have been adjusted to a fully tax equivalent basis to more appropriately compare the returns on certain tax exempt loans and securities to those on taxable interest earning assets 
the effect of such adjustment is presented in the following table table effect of tax equivalent adjustment dollar amounts in thousands change net interest income tax equivalent adjustment tax equivalent net interest income tax equivalent net interest income in increased in comparison to primarily due to growth in interest earning assets 
the benefits of this growth were partially offset by a lower net interest margin  which fell basis points from in to in the decrease in net interest margin reflects the combined impact of the flat interest rate curve on interest earning asset yields and increasing liability costs as the deposit mix shifted in response to higher interest rates and competitive pricing 
tax equivalent net interest income in increased from primarily as a result of growth in interest earning assets acquired as part of the covest acquisition 
this increase was partially offset by lower net interest margins 
margin contraction of basis points in resulted primarily from the repricing of earning assets in the low interest rate environment and the acceleration of cash flows due to refinance related prepayments on mortgage backed securities

the company s tax equivalent net interest margin was in as compared to in and in the decrease reflected the impact of the flattening interest rate yield curve on longer term asset yields as well as the shift of customer balances from lower costing transaction accounts to higher costing time deposits  as consumer preferences adjusted to the increasing level of shorter term interest rates and competitive pricing over this period 
this impact was partially offset by a million contribution to net interest income and to net interest margin resulting from the return to accruing status of a million nonperforming real estate construction loan during the second half of this loan returned to accruing status as the company expects ongoing remediation efforts to result in recoveries in excess of recorded principal by the end of first quarter  with the amount of such excess recoveries recorded as interest income

table of contents reflect the combined impact of the flat interest rate curve on interest earning asset yields and increasing liability costs as the deposit mix shifted in response to higher interest rates and competitive pricing 
net interest margin for second quarter increased basis points from for first quarter this increase reflected the positive impact of comparatively higher shorter term interest rates on loan yields and the lagging effects on repricing deposit costs  both of which were offset  in part  by the impact of a flattening yield curve on longer term asset yields 
net interest margin in decreased as interest earning assets repriced more quickly than interest bearing liabilities during the continued low interest rate environment 
the average yield earned on interest earning assets decreased by basis points in  while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased by basis points 
net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  an improvement from third quarter s and second quarter s 
this linked quarter margin improvement reflects the benefit of rising short term interest rates  which increased basis points from june  to december  in addition  linked quarter performance benefited from higher security yields as mortgage related prepayment speeds slowed 
net interest margin declined during the first half of as a greater volume of interest earning assets began to reprice during that period of continued low interest rates 
in part  the speed of this decline was accelerated as a result of the impact of refinance related prepayments on mortgage backed securities and certain measures taken by management to better insulate net interest income and margin from the potential of future rising interest rates

this measure is used as a gauge of the portfolio s price volatility at a single point in time and is not intended to be a precise predictor of future market values  as such values will be influenced by a number of factors 
average life is presented in years and represents the weighted average time to receive all future cash flows  using the dollar amount of principal pay downs as the weighting factor 
securities that the company believes could be sold prior to maturity in order to manage interest rate  prepayment  or liquidity risk are classified as securities available for sale and are carried at fair market value 
unrealized gains and losses on this portfolio segment are reported on an after tax basis as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income

at december   the available for sale securities portfolio totaled billion as compared with billion at december  the million increase in the portfolio from year end is primarily the result of security purchases  partially offset by a million decrease in the unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities 
in comparison to  the mix of securities held in the portfolio reflects more longer term municipal securities and less shorter term us agency securities 
in the uncertain and evolving interest rate environment  the company believes these municipal securities should help stabilize its net interest margin and limit future price volatility resulting from changing interest rates  as compared to alternative investment options 
the effective duration of the available for sale portfolio increased from as of december  to as of december   primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in longer term interest rates on mortgage backed securities  as well as the increase in longer term state and municipal securities 
the company adjusts the size and composition of its securities portfolio according to a number of factors  including expected loan growth  anticipated growth in collateralized public funds on account  and decisions regarding the level of family related asset exposure held on the balance sheet 
this exposure represents both direct loans to customers and mortgage backed securities

portfolio management and composition the company s portfolio is comprised of both corporate and consumer loans  with corporate loans representing approximately of total loans outstanding 
the corporate loan component represents commercial and industrial  agricultural  real estate commercial  and real estate construction lending categories 
the company seeks to balance its corporate loan portfolio among loan categories as well as by industry segment  subject to internal policy limits and as influenced by market and economic conditions 
the company seeks to maintain a diversified portfolio of both corporate and consumer loans to minimize its exposure to any particular industry or any segment of the economy 
the company concentrates its lending activities in the geographic areas it serves 
consistent with the company s emphasis on relationship banking  most of these credits represent core  multi relationship customers of the company 
the customers usually maintain deposit relationships and utilize other company banking services  such as cash management or trust services 
the company seeks to reduce its credit risk by limiting its exposure to any one borrower 
although the company s legal lending limit approximates million  the largest loan balance to a single borrower at year end was million  and only borrowers had aggregate loan balances outstanding in excess of million 
in terms of overall commitments to extend credit  the company s largest exposure to a single borrower as of december  was million and to a group of related companies comprising a single relationship was million

prior year end the company s total loans as of december  increased to billion  an increase of million as compared to billion as of december  as increases in corporate lending and real estate family loans offset declines in direct and indirect installment loans 
corporate loan balances as of december  increased as compared to december   primarily due to growth in commercial and real estate commercial lending resulting from continuing sales efforts producing growth in both loans to existing customers and new customer relationships 
the company s total loans at december  increased from december   as increases in corporate lending offset decreases in consumer loans 
corporate loan balances as of december  increased by from year end 
table of contents  primarily due to continued increases in commercial  agricultural  and real estate commercial lending 
the increase in commercial and real estate commercial loans reflects the impact of continuing sales efforts and customers drawing upon existing lines of credit  while real estate construction loans declined by as certain loans matured 
corporate loans as of december   corporate loans represented of total loans outstanding as compared to at december  and at december  in  the percentage of corporate loans to total loans grew as a result of strong real estate commercial lending activity  as well as declining indirect and direct consumer loan balances 
real estate commercial and construction lending has always been an area of focus for the company 
because of the strength of the suburban chicago real estate market over the past several years  real estate commercial and construction lending grew to a combined of the company s total loans as of december  the combination of seasoned  long time borrowers  experienced senior lending officers  management s focus on market fundamentals  and a rigorous underwriting process are believed to give the company a competitive market advantage 
the company believes these factors and a balanced exposure to any particular industry segment reduce the company s exposure to loss 
real estate commercial loans consist of residential development loans  multi unit residential mortgages  and real estate commercial mortgages 
lessors of commercial real estate comprise approximately of the company s real estate commercial loans 
these loans represent various types of commercial properties  including industrial buildings  office buildings  retail shopping centers  and other business related activities 
another of the company s real estate commercial loans represent multi family loans made to real estate companies and to individual investors to finance or refinance apartment buildings 
these apartment buildings are primarily concentrated in the metropolitan chicago area and typically range in size from five units up to twenty four units  although larger projects may range up to units or more 
the company believes that this type of lending helps diversify its already strong commercial and real estate development platform and represents an opportunity for growth 
real estate construction loans are primarily single family and multi family residential and non residential projects located in the company s primary markets 
real estate construction loans are a profitable line of lending for the company due to the higher level of interest rates and fees earned on such loans as compared to other loan categories and the company s favorable loss experience on these loans 
table specifies the company s corporate loan portfolio  including commercial and industrial loans  by industry segment and illustrates the diversity of its loan portfolio 
table summarizes the loan portfolio s maturities and interest rate sensitivity 
consumer loans as of december   consumer loans represented of total loans outstanding as compared to at december  and at december  the decline in consumer loans as a percentage of total loans is largely influenced by lower indirect consumer loans  reflecting the company s decision in to cease the origination of new volumes from this marginally profitable business line 
the home equity category represents the single largest portion of the consumer portfolio  consisting mainly of revolving lines of credit secured by junior liens on owner occupied real estate 
as a general rule  loan to collateral value ratios for these credits range from to  with of home equity loans having a loan to collateral value ratio of or less 
consumer loan balances as of december  decreased from december  following a decrease of during  primarily reflecting a decrease in indirect installment loans offset by an increase in real estate family lending 
indirect consumer lending declined by  as payments received on existing loans were not replaced with new volumes 
real estate family loans increased by million  or  from year end as the company elected to retain in its loan portfolio certain mortgage loans originated through established community reinvestment programs or loans that have met certain other lending criteria 
as previously discussed in the section titled investment portfolio management  the company also has exposure to family real estate embedded in its securities portfolio  as these assets tend to be longer in duration and have similar risk characteristics 
the decline in consumer loan balances in resulted from two asset redeployment decisions elected by management 
first  the company converted million of certain family residential mortgages into an investment security during the fourth quarter of second  the company exited its marginally profitable indirect consumer lending business  resulting in a year over year million reduction of loans outstanding from december  this decline was partially offset in by increased home equity line sales activity  resulting from pricing and promotional activities 

table of contents distribution of corporate loans by industry table summarizes the company s ten most significant industry segments for the corporate loan portfolio as of december    and these categories are based upon the nature of the borrower s ongoing business activity as opposed to the collateral underlying an individual loan 
to the extent that a borrower s underlying business activity changes  classification differences between periods will arise 
as a result  the company periodically reassesses and adjusts industry classifications 
the company believes its loan portfolio is diversified across industries and market segments

table of contents credit quality management and reserve for loan losses in addition to portfolio diversification  the company has established a system of internal controls to mitigate credit risk  including standard lending and credit policies  underwriting criteria and collateral safeguards 
the company monitors and implements its formal credit policies and procedures and regularly evaluates trends  collectibility  and collateral protection within the loan portfolio 
the company s policy and procedures are regularly reviewed and modified in order to manage risk as conditions change and new credit products are offered 
the company s credit administration policies include a comprehensive loan rating system 
the performance standard of the company s internal loan review staff is to annually review at least of the balance of all corporate loans and all new loans in excess of million 
account officers are responsible for monitoring their customer relationships and determining changes in the loan ratings on credits they monitor 
the company believes that any significant change in the overall quality of the loan portfolio will be reflected in the cumulative effect of changes to these loan ratings 
in addition  the company s senior managers actively review those loans that require some form of remediation 
these loans are reviewed quarterly  and action plans are developed to either remedy any emerging problem loans or to remove any such loans from the portfolio 
certain loans may also be reviewed by senior executive officers  including the chief executive officer and the chief credit officer 
during times of economic downturns  the company has increased the frequency of these reviews 
the company also maintains a reserve for loan losses to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the reserve for loan losses consists of three components i specific reserves established for expected losses resulting from analysis developed through specific credit allocations on individual loans for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the measured value of the loan  ii reserves based on historical loan loss experience for each loan category  and iii reserves based on general  current economic conditions as well as specific economic factors believed to be relevant to the markets in which the company operates 
management evaluates the sufficiency of the reserve for loan losses based upon the combined total of the specific  historical loss  and general components 
management believes that the reserve for loan losses of million is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at december  the accounting policies underlying the establishment and maintenance of the reserve for loan losses through provisions charged to operating expense are discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

table of contents gross charge offs decreased in to million from million in and million in  with decreases in all major loan categories except for home equity loans 
the decrease in gross charge offs from to resulted from the charge off in of certain loans acquired as part of the covest acquisition 
these covest loans charged off also drove the increase in gross charge offs from to the lower level of charge offs in primarily benefited from a tightening of the underwriting standards for the indirect lending portfolio initiated in as the economy weakened 
in addition  the level of corporate charge offs in and were elevated as the company recognized the weakening economy and adopted an aggressive problem loan identification and charge off strategy 
in  the company decreased the reserves allocated to the commercial and industrial  agricultural  and real estate commercial categories as a result of improved delinquency and charge off trends 
reserve allocations to the consumer loan portfolio also decreased in as compared to due to the decline in the total consumer loan portfolio 
the increase in the reserve for loan losses allocated to the real estate construction category in reflects the comparatively greater influence placed on the concentration of large loans in this category 
the company increased the reserve for loan losses allocated to the commercial and industrial and real estate commercial categories in from due to loan growth  as well as elevated losses attributed to loans acquired from and originated by covest 
reserve allocations to the consumer loan portfolio decreased in compared to as a result of improved delinquency and charge off trends as the portfolio mix shifted from higher risk  indirect lending to lower risk home equity lending 
in  allocation of the company s reserve to the commercial and industrial  real estate commercial  and real estate construction categories increased as compared to  due in large part to comparatively higher exposures to single borrowers and portfolio growth amid concerns relative to the continuing level of economic weakness 
the growth in the commercial reserve allocation was also caused by an increase in specific reserves relating to the higher level of impaired loans 
these category increases were partly offset by improved delinquency and charge off trends in all corporate lending areas 
reserve allocations to the consumer loan portfolio decreased in relation to due to improved delinquency and charge off trends 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued  loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest and principal due to a weakening of the borrower s financial condition  and real estate that has been acquired primarily through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition 
for a detailed discussion on the company s policy on accrual of interest on loans see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
loans past due days and still accruing interest are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they are adequately secured by collateral  in the process of collection  and reasonably expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status

nonaccrual loans at december  totaled million  compared with million at year end due to a decline in commercial and industrial  real estate commercial  and real estate construction nonaccrual loans 
nonaccrual commercial and industrial and real estate commercial loans declined  reflecting vigorous remediation efforts 
the decrease in nonaccrual real estate construction loans from december  to december  resulted from the transfer to accruing status of a million nonperforming loan acquired from covest banc in this loan returned to accruing status as the company expects ongoing remediation efforts to result in recoveries in excess of recorded principal by the end of first quarter  with the amount of such excess recoveries recorded as interest income 
the loan was included in loans past due days and still accruing interest as of december  loans past due days and still accruing interest totaled million as of december   up from million as of december  and million as of december  the increase of million in loans past due days primarily resulted from the previously discussed million loan acquired from covest banc and a single million past due commercial and industrial loan  which is fully secured by cash 

table of contents nonperforming asset levels improved in as compared to as two renegotiated credits totaling million returned to performing status in first quarter due to sustained borrower performance pursuant to the restructured terms and management s expectation of continuing performance 
these troubled credits were renegotiated pursuant to existing market terms during second quarter and were included in nonperforming assets as of december  these two loans  along with million in total nonaccruing loans acquired as part of the covest acquisition  drove the increase in nonperforming assets in as compared to nonaccrual loans increased million in from due to a million increase in commercial nonaccrual loans  primarily the result of three credits moved to nonaccrual status in the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in family real estate nonaccrual loans 
the million increase in total nonaccrual loans in reflected an increase of million in nonperforming commercial and industrial and real estate construction loans  partially offset by a decrease of million in real estate commercial loans 
s increase in nonperforming commercial and industrial and real estate construction loans was principally due to million of nonaccruing loans acquired from covest 
in addition to the loans summarized in table  on december   the company had million of loans that were currently performing  but for which the company had some concern with the ability of the borrower to comply with existing loan repayment terms 
this amount decreased from million at year end  following a decrease from million at year end these loans continue to perform under existing terms and accrue interest 
the company anticipates that the type of restructure  guarantee  additional collateral  or other planned action will result in the full repayment of debt 
the classification of these loans  however  does not imply that management expects losses on these loans but rather that a higher level of scrutiny is prudent under the circumstances 
the decrease in as compared to the prior year reflects the identification and subsequent improvement of two large credit relationships  which management believed warranted greater scrutiny at the end of given the state of the economy and the circumstances of the borrower 
both of these loans matured in and were fully repaid 
the company s disclosure with respect to impaired loans is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
funding and liquidity management the company s approach to liquidity management is to obtain funding sources at a minimum cost to meet fluctuating deposit  withdrawal  and loan demand needs 
the company s liquidity policy establishes parameters as to how liquidity should be managed to maintain flexibility in responding to changes in liquidity needs over a month forward period  including the requirement to formulate a quarterly liquidity compliance plan for review by the bank s board of directors 
the compliance plan includes an analysis that measures projected needs to purchase and sell funds 
the analysis incorporates a set of projected balance sheet assumptions that are updated quarterly 
based on these assumptions  the company determines its total cash liquidity on hand and excess collateral capacity from pledging  unused federal funds purchased lines  and other unused borrowing capacity such as federal home loan bank fhlb advances  resulting in a calculation of the company s total liquidity capacity 
the company s total policy directed liquidity requirement is of total sources demand deposits  interest bearing transactional deposits  retail time deposits  other borrowings  and other liabilities and equity less collateralized liabilities 
based upon the company s projections as of december   the company expects to have liquidity capacity in excess of policy guidelines for the forward twelve month period 
the liquidity needs of first midwest bancorp  inc on an unconsolidated basis parent company consist primarily of operating expenses and dividend payments to its stockholders 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from subsidiaries 
at december   the parent company had unused short term credit facilities available to fund cash flow needs totaling million 
as of december   the parent company also has the ability to enhance its liquidity position by raising capital or incurring debt 
the parent company had million in junior subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities outstanding but had no debt outstanding under its short term credit facility 
the parent company had cash and equivalent short term investments of million as of such date 
total deposits and borrowed funds as of december  are summarized in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
the following table provides a comparison of average funding sources over the last three years

average time deposit balances increased to billion in as compared to partly due to targeted pricing and promotional strategies designed to encourage longer term retail deposits 
in addition  average brokered deposits increased million  or  from to as the company shifted part of its funding mix into longer term deposits in anticipation of rising interest rates 
the increase in time deposit balances was partially offset by decreases in savings  now  and money market balances as consumer preferences changed in response to the comparatively higher level of interest rates and time deposit promotion 
the company s total average deposits for increased from  largely the result of its acquisition of million in deposits as part of the covest acquisition 
in and  the company focused its sales efforts on increasing core funding sources from transactional deposits  as these funding costs are generally less expensive and less price sensitive than wholesale borrowed funds 
in and  pricing strategies influenced by the overall low level of interest rates  combined with instability in the equity markets  created an incentive for customers seeking liquidity to retain balances in transactional accounts as opposed to shifting them to longer term time deposits 
public balances  denoting the funds held on account for municipalities and other public entities  are included as a part of the company s total funding sources 
public balances represent an important customer segment for the company  and reflects the community based roots of the company 
the company enters into specific agreements with public customers to pledge collateral  primarily securities  in support of the balances on account 
because the average customer tenure with the company is approximately years  they provide the company with a more reliable  lower cost  short term funding source for its securities portfolio than is available through other wholesale alternatives 
these relationships also provide numerous cross sell and business referral opportunities 
for  the company had average public funds on account totaling million  of which were collateralized with mortgage loans and securities 
of this total  million was held in deposit accounts  predominately now accounts  with the remainder representing securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
this contrasts to average balances maintained of million in and million in year to year changes in balances are influenced by the tax collection activities of the various municipalities as well as the general level of interest rates

under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  the company and the bank are subject to various capital requirements set and administered by the federal banking agencies 
these requirements specify minimum capital ratios  defined as tier and total capital as a percentage of assets and off balance sheet items that have been weighted according to broad risk categories  as well as a leverage ratio that compares tier capital to adjusted average assets 
the company and the bank have managed their capital ratios to consistently maintain such measurements in excess of the federal reserve board frb minimum levels considered to be well capitalized  which is the highest capital category established 
the following table presents the company s consolidated measures of capital as of the dates presented and the capital guidelines established by the frb to be categorized as well capitalized 
table capital measurements december  regulatory minimum for well capitalized regulatory capital ratios total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage to average assets tangible equity ratios tangible equity to tangible assets tangible equity to risk weighted assets ratio is not subject to formal frb regulatory guidance 
tangible equity equals total equity less goodwill and other intangibles  and tangible assets equals total assets less goodwill and other intangibles 
internal guidelines provide for a targeted ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets to be in the range of to 
as of december   the company s total risk based capital was  compared to as of december  as tier capital increased million during that period 
its tier risk based capital ratio was  compared to as of december  the company s tangible capital ratio  which represents the ratio of stockholders equity to total assets excluding intangible assets  stood at  down from as of december   primarily reflecting the impact of asset growth and a shift in accumulated other comprehensive income loss from an accumulated income level of million as of december  to an accumulated loss of million as of december  the company expects to remain well capitalized following the acquisition of bank calumet

stock repurchase programs the company continues to follow a policy of retaining sufficient capital to support growth in total assets and returning excess capital to stockholders in the form of dividends and through common stock repurchases 
the latter increases the percentage ownership of the company by existing stockholders 
on may   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the company s common stock  or of shares then outstanding  the board rescinded the former repurchase plan under which  shares authority remained 
the new plan is the tenth such program since the company s formation in and authorizes stock repurchases in both open market and privately negotiated transactions and has no execution time limit 
the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at a weighted average cost per share of during and  shares of its common stock at a weighted average cost per share of during at december   the company s authority to repurchase  shares remained under the current share repurchase authorization 
in  the company anticipates suspension of share repurchase activity as it looks to rebuild tangible capital given the expected cash acquisition of bank calumet in early second quarter 
table of contents shares repurchased are held as treasury stock and are available for issuances in conjunction with the company s dividend reinvestment plan  qualified and nonqualified retirement plans  and stock option plans as well as for other general corporate purposes 
the company reissued  treasury shares in and  treasury shares in to fund such plans 
dividends the company believes that it has a responsibility to reward its stockholders with a meaningful current return on their investment  and as part of the company s dividend policy  the company s board of directors periodically reviews its dividend payout ratio to ensure that it is consistent with internal capital guidelines  industry standards  and peer group practices 
as a result of improved performance from operations as well as the company s perceived future prospects  the company s board of directors increased the quarterly dividend twice in on may   the company increased its quarterly dividend by from to per share  and  on november   the company increased its quarterly dividend by an additional to per share

fourth quarter vs 
the company s net income for the quarter ended december  was million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  for fourth quarter  a decline of on a per diluted share basis 
the company s annualized return on average assets was for fourth quarter as compared to for fourth quarter its annualized return on average equity was for fourth quarter as compared to for fourth quarter 
table of contents fourth quarter results included million in security losses and  in employee severance costs  and fourth quarter results included million in security gains 
the company s net interest income grew by to million in fourth quarter as compared to million in s fourth quarter 
net interest margin for fourth quarter was  down from for fourth quarter and for third quarter the decrease from third quarter to fourth quarter reflects the combined impact of the flat interest rate curve on interest earning asset yields and increasing liability costs as the deposit mix shifted in response to higher interest rates and competitive pricing 
the company s total loans as of december  increased to billion  an increase of million as compared to december   as increases of million in corporate lending and million in real estate family loans offset declines in consumer lending of million 
corporate loans  representing the aggregate of commercial  real estate commercial  real estate construction  and agricultural lending categories  increased from december  as compared to september   total loans increased million  or  as growth in real estate commercial  agricultural  and family real estate lending offset declines in indirect consumer  commercial  and real estate construction loans outstanding 
total average deposits for fourth quarter were billion  an increase of as compared to fourth quarter  largely as the result of a increase in time deposits 
average time deposits for fourth quarter in comparison to fourth quarter reflect the combined impact of targeted sales promotions and higher levels of brokered deposits 
the increase in time deposit balances was partially offset by decreases in savings  now  and money market balances as consumer preferences changed in response to the higher level of interest rates and time deposit promotions 
noninterest income  including securities gains and losses  in fourth quarter was million  a decline of as compared to million in fourth quarter fourth quarter includes security losses of million  and fourth quarter includes million in gains from the sale of securities and million in gains from the sale of various assets 
excluding this activity from both periods  noninterest income would have totaled million for fourth quarter  an increase of as compared to million for fourth quarter  reflecting solid growth in fee based revenues

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
interest rate risk is the company s primary market risk and is the result of repricing  basis  and option risk 
repricing risk represents timing mismatches in the company s ability to alter contractual rates earned on financial assets or paid on liabilities in response to market interest rates 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of the spread earned on a loan or investment relative to its cost of funds 
option risk arises from the embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options or deposit early withdrawal options 
these provide customers opportunities to take advantage of directional changes in rates and could have an adverse impact on the company s margin performance 
the company seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and net income while managing volatility that arises from shifts in interest rates 
the bank s asset and liability management committee alco oversees financial risk 
table of contents management by developing programs to measure and manage interest rate risks within authorized limits set by the bank s board of directors 
alco also approves the bank s asset liability management policies  oversees the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings  and reviews the bank s interest rate sensitivity position 
management uses net interest income and economic value of equity simulation modeling tools to analyze and capture near term and longer term interest rate exposures 
net interest income sensitivity the analysis of net interest income sensitivities assesses the magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates over a month horizon using multiple rate scenarios 
these scenarios include  but are not limited to  a most likely forecast  a flat or unchanged rate environment  a gradual increase and decrease of basis points that occurs in equal steps over a six month time horizon  and immediate increases and decreases of and basis points 
this simulation analysis is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet and off balance sheet instruments and incorporates market based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities 
this simulation analysis includes management s projections for activity levels in each of the product lines offered by the company 
the analysis also incorporates assumptions based upon the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to interest rates 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the simulation analysis cannot definitively measure net interest income or predict the impact of the fluctuation in interest rates on net interest income 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the company monitors and manages interest rate risk within approved policy limits 
the company s current interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the change in net interest income over a month horizon assuming a basis point gradual increase and decrease in all interest rate limits 
current policy limits this exposure to plus or minus of the anticipated level of net interest income over the corresponding month horizon assuming no change in current interest rates 
given the low interest rate environment at december   the bank s board of directors temporarily authorized operation outside of existent policy limits under the gradual falling rate scenario discussed above 
as of december   the company was operating within the policy limits 
analysis of net interest income sensitivity dollar amounts in thousands gradual change in rates immediate change in rates december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change     n m  percent change n m reflects an assumed uniform change in interest rates across all terms that occurs in equal steps over a six month horizon 
n m due to the low level of interest rates as of year end  in management s judgment  an assumed basis point drop in interest rates was deemed not meaningful in the existent interest rate environment 
the projected sensitivity of the company s net interest income to rising interest rates moved from a position of positive exposure as of december  to one of negative exposure as of december  conversely  for these same periods  the company s net interest income sensitivity to falling rates reflected a less negative exposure 
the comparative change in projected net interest income sensitivity reflects the combined impact of differing interest rate environments as well as differences in actual and anticipated balance sheet mix and pricing 
economic value of equity in addition to the simulation analysis  management uses an economic value of equity sensitivity technique to understand the risk in both shorter and longer term positions and to study the impact of longer term cash flows on earnings and capital 
in determining the economic value of equity  the company discounts present values of expected cash flows on all assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash 
table of contents flows represents the company s economic value of equity 
economic value of equity does not represent the true fair value of asset  liability  or derivative positions because certain factors are not considered  such as credit risk  liquidity risk  and the impact of future changes to the balance sheet 
the company s policy guidelines call for preventative measures to be taken in the event that an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points is estimated to reduce the economic value of equity by more than 
analysis of economic value of equity dollar amounts in thousands immediate change in rates december  dollar change percent change december  dollar change percent change the estimated sensitivity of the company s economic value of equity to changes in interest rates increased in a rising interest rate scenario and decreased in a falling interest rate scenario in comparison to december  the comparative increase in sensitivity to rising interest rates primarily resulted from changes in the estimated average life of assets and liabilities 
the estimated average life of assets increased in  primarily due to changes in the duration of the security portfolio as influenced by the impact of higher longer term interest rates on mortgage backed securities and increased holdings of longer term state and municipal securities 
the estimated average life of liabilities shortened from  primarily due to the combined impact of swap derivative activity and fhlb advances and junior subordinated debentures moving closer to maturity 
interest rate derivatives as part of its approach to controlling the interest rate risk within its balance sheet  the company has used derivative instruments specifically interest rate swaps with third parties in order to limit volatility in net interest income 
the advantages of using such interest rate derivatives include minimization of balance sheet leverage resulting in lower capital requirements as compared to cash instruments  the ability to maintain or increase liquidity  and the opportunity to customize the interest rate swap to meet desired risk parameters 
the accounting policies underlying the treatment of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated statements of condition and income of the company are described in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
interest rate swap transactions involve exchanges of fixed and floating rate interest payments without the exchange of the underlying notional ie  principal amount on which the interest payments are calculated 
when the interest rate swap has been appropriately designated as a hedge  the net cash flow paid or received by the company on these transactions is treated as an adjustment to interest income and expense on the underlying earning asset or funding source to which the swap relates 
a risk associated with interest rate swap transactions is credit risk  defined as the ability of the swap counterparty to perform its interest payment obligation under the terms of the agreement 
credit risk on interest rate swap transactions consists of the aggregate net interest payable to the company by the counterparty in addition to the aggregate unrealized gain on the swap position 
the company controls this credit risk by reviewing each counterparty for creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and quarterly thereafter and maintaining a policy limiting credit exposure to any one counterparty to not more than of consolidated stockholders equity 
in addition  the company s interest rate swap transactions require the establishment of a mutual mark to market arrangement whereby cash collateral is required to be on deposit with the company and or the counterparty  depending upon the existing net settlement position 
the company does not currently act as an intermediary in arranging interest rate swaps for customers 
the company had total interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  and million at december   hedging various balance sheet categories 
the specific terms of the interest rate swaps outstanding as of december  and are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k
