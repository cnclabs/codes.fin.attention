our businesses are organized into three reportable segments 
us retail reflects business with a wide variety of grocery stores  mass merchandisers  club stores  specialty stores and drug  dollar and discount chains operating throughout the united states 
our major product categories in this business segment are ready to eat cereals  meals  refrigerated and frozen dough products  baking products  snacks  yogurt and organic foods 
our international segment is made up of retail businesses outside of the united states  including a retail business in canada that largely mirrors our us retail product mix  and foodservice businesses outside of the united states and canada 
our bakeries and foodservice segment consists of products marketed throughout the united states and canada to retail and wholesale bakeries  commercial and noncommercial foodservice distributors and operators  restaurants  and convenience stores 
our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term 
in the most recent fiscal year  our total return to stockholders  including stock price appreciation and dividends  was percent  while the s p index returned percent  from fiscal to  our total return to stockholders averaged percent per year while the s p index posted a percent average annual return over the same period 
our long term growth objectives are low single digit average annual growth in net sales  mid single digit average annual growth in total segment operating profit see page for our discussion of this measure not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and high single digit average annual growth in earnings per share eps 

table of contents these measures  combined with an attractive dividend yield and improvement in return on capital  drive the management of our business 
for the fiscal year ended may   our net sales grew percent and total segment operating profit grew percent  in line with our long term goals 
diluted eps decreased percent in fiscal  however  excluding the eps effects of our convertible debentures in both fiscal years and the fiscal net benefit of gains on divestitures and debt repurchase costs  our diluted eps grew percent  in line with our long term goal see page for our discussion of this measure not defined by gaap 
our net cash provided by operations increased to nearly billion in  enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments by percent from fiscal  continue to return cash to stockholders via share repurchases  which totaled million in fiscal  and repay million of debt

finally  we plan to expand our margins by focusing on realizing price increases  managing our input costs  and achieving productivity through supply chain and administrative cost saving efforts 
we expect our fiscal interest expense to be million higher than in fiscal  primarily due to higher interest rates

we believe that two important measures of financial strength are the ratio of fixed charge coverage and the ratio of operating cash flow defined as net cash provided by operating activities to debt defined as notes payable plus long term debt  including current portion 
our fixed charge coverage in fiscal was compared to in fiscal fiscal was favorably impacted by the gain on our disposition of our percent equity interest in sve 
our operating cash flow to debt ratio increased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal currently  standard and poor s corporation has ratings of bbb on our publicly held long term debt and a on our commercial paper 
moody s investors services  inc has ratings of baa for our long term debt and p for our commercial paper 
fitch ratings  inc rates our long term debt bbb and our commercial paper f dominion bond rating service in canada currently rates general mills as a low 
these ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
we also believe that growth in return on average capital is a key measure  and it is used for management performance ratings 
return on average capital increased from percent in to percent in due to earnings growth and disciplined use of cash 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor is it our policy to issue

our maximum exposure to loss from these vies is limited to the million minority interest in gm capital  the contract manufacturer s debt and our million of equity investments in the two remaining vies 
the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations  including payments due by period 
the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer directed marketing commitments that support our brands 
the net fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps was million at may   based on market values as of that date 
future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future 
other long term obligations primarily consist of income taxes  accrued compensation and benefits  and miscellaneous liabilities 
we are unable to estimate the timing of the payments for these items 
we do not have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our defined benefit retirement and other postretirement benefit plans

our significant accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies include our accounting for trade and consumer promotion activities  goodwill and other intangible asset impairments  income taxes  and pension and other postretirement benefits 
trade and consumer promotion activities we report sales net of certain coupon and trade promotion costs 
the consumer coupon costs recorded as a reduction of sales are based on the estimated redemption value of those coupons  as determined by historical patterns of coupon redemption and consideration of current market conditions such as competitive activity in those product categories 
the trade promotion costs include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf  such as advertising or in store displays  discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices  and payments to gain distribution of new products 
the cost of these activities is recognized as the related revenue is recorded  which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels 
these estimates are made based on the quantity of customer sales  the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities  and other factors 
differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
our accrued trade and consumer promotion liability was million as of may   and million as of may  our unit volume in the last week of each quarter is consistently higher than the average for the preceding weeks of the quarter 
in comparison to the average daily shipments in the first weeks of a quarter  the final week of each quarter has approximately two to four days worth of incremental shipments based on a five day week  reflecting increased promotional activity at the end of the quarter 
this increased activity includes promotions to assure that our customers have sufficient inventory on hand to support major marketing events or increased seasonal demand early in the next quarter  as well as promotions intended to help achieve interim unit volume targets 
if  due to quarter end promotions or other reasons  our customers purchase more product in any reporting period than end consumer demand will require in future periods  our sales level in future reporting periods could be adversely affected 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible asset impairments goodwill represents the difference between the purchase prices of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units 
we compare the carrying amount of goodwill for a reporting unit with its fair value and if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment has occurred 
finite and indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily brands  are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when fair value is less than the carrying amount of the intangible 
our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs from our annual long range planning process 
we also make estimates of discount rates  perpetuity growth assumptions and other factors 
we have completed our annual impairment testing and determined none of our goodwill or other intangible assets was impaired 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate is influenced by tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and involves management judgment as to the ultimate resolution of any tax issues 
we accrue liabilities in current income taxes payable for potential assessments related to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions 
historically  our assessments of the ultimate resolution of tax issues have been reasonably accurate 
the current open tax issues are not dissimilar in size or substance from historical items  except for the accounting for losses recorded as part of the pillsbury transaction 
management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters  including the accounting for losses recorded as part of the pillsbury transaction  will not have a material effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
pension and other postretirement benefits we have defined benefit retirement plans covering most us  canadian and united kingdom employees 
benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation 
the hourly plans include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service 
our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws 
our principal retirement plan covering domestic salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest in plan participants if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control 
we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our us and canadian retirees 
the salaried health care benefit plan is contributory  with retiree contributions based on years of service 
we fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis and made million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal actuarial assumptions we recognize benefits provided during retirement over the plan participants active working life 
accordingly  we must use various actuarial assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations 
actuarial assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans  how we derive the market related values of assets and the health care cost trend rates 
expected rate of return on plan assets our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation  our historical long term investment performance  our estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from our actuaries  investment services and investment managers  and long term inflation assumptions 
the investment objective for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us 
the goal is to optimize the long term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk 
the pension and postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes 
within asset classes  the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations 
for the pension and other postretirement plans  the long term investment policy allocations are percent to us equities  percent to international equities  percent to private equities  percent to fixed income  and percent to real assets real estate  energy and timber 
the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long term policy allocations based on relative market valuations 
our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates were percent  percent  percent  percent and percent for the    and year periods ended may  for fiscal  and  we assumed a rate of return of percent on our pension plan assets and our other postretirement plan assets 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal by approximately million 

table of contents discount rates our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for our pension and other postretirement obligations 
those same discount rates also are used to determine pension and other postretirement income and expense for the following fiscal year 
we work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and  using high quality corporate bond yields  to develop a forward interest rate curve  including a margin to that index based on our credit risk 
this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 
the discount rates used in our pension and other postretirement assumptions were percent and percent  respectively  for the obligations as of may   and for our fiscal income and expense  and percent for the obligations as of may   and for our fiscal income and expense 
lowering the discount rate by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense for fiscal by approximately million 
market related value we base our determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of assets which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
health care cost trend rates we review our health care trend rates annually 
our review is based on data and information we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries 
this information includes recent plan experience  plan design  overall industry experience and projections  and assumptions used by other similar organizations 
our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review  recent experiences  and short term expectations 
our current health care cost trend rate assumption is percent for retirees age and over and percent for retirees under age these rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of percent is reached in for retirees over age and for retirees under age the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement benefit plans 
if the health care cost trend rate increased by percentage point in each future year  the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of postretirement expense for fiscal would increase by million  and the postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of may   would increase by million 
financial statement impact in fiscal  we recorded net pension and postretirement expense of million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of may   we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of million on our pension plans and million on our postretirement plans  primarily as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions 
these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 
for our fiscal pension and other postretirement income and expense estimate  we have increased the discount rate to percent for our pension liabilities and percent for our other postretirement liabilities  based on interest rates and our credit spread as of may  the expected rate of return on plan assets remains percent 
actual future net pension and postretirement income or expense will depend on investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension and postretirement plans 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which generally requires public companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the standard is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after june   with several transition options regarding prospective versus retrospective application 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal  using the modified prospective method 
accordingly  prior year results will not be restated  but fiscal results will be presented as if we had applied the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation from the beginning of fiscal we currently expect the impact of adopting the fair value method of valuing stock awards to be approximately to per diluted share for fiscal however  the actual impact on fiscal will be largely dependent 
table of contents on the particular structure of stock based awards granted during fiscal and various market factors that affect the fair value of awards 
we are evaluating whether to allocate these costs to our operating segments 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required  thereby reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods following adoption 
while those amounts cannot be estimated for future periods  the amount of operating cash flows generated in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal see note one to the consolidated financial statements on pages through in item eight of this report

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions  authorized under our policies that place clear controls on these activities 
the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions 
we establish credit limits for each counterparty 
our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments 
interest rates we manage our debt structure and our interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and derivatives 
we use interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce volatility of our financing costs 
generally under these swaps  we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount 
our primary exposure is to us interest rates 
as of may   we had billion of aggregate notional principal amount the principal amount on which the fixed or floating interest rate is calculated outstanding 
this includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps 
see note six to the consolidated financial statements on pages through in item eight of this report 
foreign currency rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
we primarily use foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts to selectively hedge our cash flow exposure to changes in exchange rates 
these contracts function as hedges  since they change in value inversely to the change created in the underlying exposure as foreign exchange rates fluctuate 
our primary us dollar exchange rate exposures are with the canadian dollar  the euro  the australian dollar  the mexican peso and the british pound 
commodities many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks 
we manage this market risk through an integrated set of financial instruments  including purchase orders  noncancelable contracts  futures contracts  options and swaps 
our primary commodity price exposures are to cereal grains  sugar  dairy products  vegetables  fruits  meats  vegetable oils  and other agricultural products  as well as paper and plastic packaging materials  operating supplies and energy 
equity instruments equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments owned by our employees are revalued 
we use equity swaps to manage this market risk 
value at risk these estimates are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity prices under normal market conditions 
a monte carlo var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures 
the models assumed normal market conditions and used a percent confidence level 
the var calculation used historical interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity and equity prices from the past year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future 
the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
the positions included in the calculations were debt  investments  interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forwards  commodity swaps  futures and options  and equity instruments 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities related positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments 
the table below presents the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value for our interest rate  foreign currency  commodity and equity market risk sensitive instruments outstanding on may  and may   and the average amount outstanding during the year ended may  the amounts were calculated using the var methodology described above
