we also discuss those items affecting our results that were not considered in senior management s assessment of the operating performance of our business segments 
we separately disclose these items to assist in your evaluation of our overall operating performance and financial condition of the consolidated company 
we would like to draw your attention to the following items disclosed in this financial section and where you will find them topic location s critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition postretirement benefit plans environmental matters discussion of business segments page and page page and page page  page and page page and page liquidity and cash flows page and page capital structure and resources page  page  page and page legal proceedings  commitments and contingencies page and page stock based compensation page  page and page industry considerations department of defense business customer requirements for defense and related advanced technology systems for and beyond will continue to be affected by the global war on terrorism through the continued need for military missions and reconstruction efforts in iraq and afghanistan and the related fiscal consequences of war 
the war on terrorism has focused greater attention on the security of our 
table of contents homeland and better communication and interoperability between law enforcement  civil government agencies  intelligence agencies and our military services 
at the same time  our nation s overall defense posture continues to move toward a more joint capabilities based structure  which creates the ability for a more flexible response with greater force mobility  stronger space capabilities  enhanced missile defense and improved information systems capabilities and security 
the us department of defense dod recently completed the congressionally mandated quadrennial defense review qdr 
the qdr continues and accelerates the dod s prior commitment to a transformation of the military to focus more on the needs of its combatant commanders and to develop portfolios of joint capabilities rather than stove piped programs 
this movement towards horizontally integrated structures is expected to become an organizing principle for the dod in making investment decisions for future systems 
we formed the integrated systems solutions business segment in to help us better focus our integrated solutions capabilities across the corporation and enhance our ability to serve as a lead partner with the dod 
in  we opened our center for innovation  a state of the art facility for modeling and simulating our net centric solutions for our customers 
the president s budget proposal for fiscal year and beyond presents a framework to reduce the federal budget deficit while prosecuting the global war on terrorism 
the dod budget is growing  but at lower levels than in the past few years  in order to continue the modernization and recapitalization that began earlier this decade 
the budget for the department of homeland security is increasing  while spending across other non defense federal agencies is anticipated to decline through these changes in the president s budget plan reflect a commitment to a reduction in the federal budget deficit by  and the sentiment expressed by the federal reserve that sustained federal deficits could hamper economic growth 
the president s budget proposal includes billion for the dod  including billion for procurement of systems and billion for research and development 
transformation of the dod enterprise and accompanying budget pressures also may create additional opportunities for supply chain logistics  business process management and outsourcing of service functions by the military services  expanding the scope of private sector contracting opportunities at the dod 
the fiscal year future years defense plan fydp projects sustained growth in the dod s top line budget  rising from billion in to billion in these estimates do not include any allowance to fund ongoing military operations in iraq  afghanistan and the global war on terrorism  which are expected to be addressed through annual supplemental appropriations as required 
the dod s continued emphasis on systems modernization is reflected in the proposed growth in the fydp for procurement  which is estimated to increase from billion in to billion in research  development  test and engineering rdt e spending will remain roughly the same during this period  ranging from billion in to billion in  declining then to billion in while subject to change in future specific budget submissions and annual appropriation by congress  these estimates continue the administration s long stated intent to modernize the armed forces while prosecuting the war on terrorism 
the differing trends in procurement and rdt e budgets reflect the maturation of programs emerging from rdt e funding into procurement  such as the f program 

table of contents in the past two years  congress provided for supplemental appropriations to defray costs for operation iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom in afghanistan 
approximately billion has already been provided relative to and another billion has been requested 
these supplemental appropriations have enabled the dod to proceed on critical modernization and acquisition programs  versus using amounts available for those programs to pay for the iraq and afghanistan missions 
while there is no assurance that additional supplemental appropriations will be approved by congress  we do not believe that sustained operations in iraq and afghanistan will materially impact the procurement and research and development budget in the near term 
we believe that our broad mix of programs and capabilities positions us favorably to support the future needs of the various agencies of the us government in defense and information technology 
our major programs and capabilities include missile defense  space intelligence  command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr  air mobility aircraft  and air power projection precision strike capability 
in terms of size and long term potential impact  two of our more significant programs are the f raptor and the f joint strike fighter 
the air force approved the f for full rate production  declared initial operational capability and rated the f mission capable based on successful completion of operational testing 
the dod plans to continue production of the f through to coincide with the anticipated production of the f to avoid a gap in th generation fighter stealth and advanced avionics capabilities 
while the ultimate number of f s to be produced will continue to be subject to debate  the qdr and budget indicate support for the program 
we are also represented in almost every aspect of land  sea  air and space based missile defense  including the aegis weapon system program  the medium extended air defense system meads  the patriot advanced capability pac missile program  the terminal high altitude area defense thaad system  and the multiple kill vehicle program 
in the areas of space intelligence and information superiority  we have leadership positions on programs such as the tsat mission operations system tmos  mobile user objective system muos  the advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  and the space based infrared system high sbirs h  and in classified programs and battle management command and control capabilities 
in airlift  we have the c j program and are under contract to upgrade the c strategic airlift aircraft 
many of the aforementioned programs require funding over several budget cycles 
there is always an inherent risk that these and other large  highly visible programs which are subject to annual appropriation by congress could become potential targets for future reductions or elimination of funding to pay for other programs 
we continually explore opportunities to expand into adjacent product lines utilizing our existing advanced technology products and services  and have been successful in doing so through such programs as the littoral combat ship and marine one us presidential helicopter programs 
we also are continuing to pursue opportunities to expand our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity of the systems procured by our customers 
in addition  we have focused our efforts on select acquisitions  cost savings and improving efficiency 
through these activities  we have been able to pass along savings to our customers  mainly the us government 

table of contents non department of defense business we provide products and services to a number of government agencies other than the dod  including the departments of homeland security  justice  commerce  health and human services and energy  the us postal service  the social security administration  the federal aviation administration  the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  the environmental protection agency epa and the library of congress 
although our lines of business addressing civil government needs are not dependent on defense budgets  they share many of the same risks as our defense businesses  as well as other risks unique to the particular programs 
for example  although indemnification by the us government to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed and deployed may be available in some instances for our defense businesses  us government indemnification may not be available for homeland security purposes 
while we maintain insurance for some business risks  it is not possible to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities 
we do plan to seek  and in certain cases have obtained  limitation of such potential liabilities related to the sale and use of our homeland security products and services through qualification by the department of homeland security under the safety act provisions of the homeland security act of in the event we were to provide homeland security related products and services to a customer without such qualification  we would not be afforded the benefit of the safety act s cap on tort liability or us government indemnification 
in addition  our information technology products and services related to homeland security may raise potential liabilities associated with privacy issues for which neither indemnification nor safety act coverage is available 
other risks unique to civil government programs may include development of competing products  technological feasibility and product obsolescence 
we have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence  knowledge management and e government solutions for our customers  including the social security administration and the epa  as well for the dod 
we also provide program management  business strategy and consulting  complex systems development and maintenance  complete life cycle software support  information assurance and enterprise solutions 
consistent with the president s agenda  the expected growth in business process outsourcing has been enabled by rule changes for public private competitions 
such a competition led to the selection in of lockheed martin to operate the federal aviation administration s automated flight services station network 
in addition  recent trends continue to indicate an increase in demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions 
as a result  we continue to focus our resources in support of infrastructure modernization that allows for interoperability and communication across agencies 
in addition  the increase in emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management  ports and waterways security  biohazard detection systems for postal equipment  information systems security and other global security systems solutions 
we provide products and services to nasa  including the space shuttle program  mainly through our space systems and information technology services business segments 
we also have a equity interest in united space alliance  llc which provides ground processing and 
table of contents other operational services to the space shuttle program 
we expect to compete for nasa programs related to the next generation manned space exploration program 
non us defense budgets have generally been flat or declining over the past decade 
as a result  consolidation has been occurring in the european aerospace industry  resulting in fewer but larger and more capable competitors 
space business sales of commercial launch vehicles and satellites continues to be very competitive due mainly to low demand for new satellites as a result of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry 
the reduction in demand has resulted in pricing pressures for both launch vehicles and satellites 
despite this environment  we did receive new orders for commercial satellites and launch vehicles in both and for a discussion of the results of operations of our space systems segment  see the discussion of business segments section 
the above factors have impacted orders for the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv or atlas v  our next generation launch vehicle program in which we have made significant investments over the past few years 
the atlas v is available for both commercial and us government use 
this program has required investment of funds for research and development  start up and other nonrecurring costs  and launch facilities 
some of these expenditures have been funded under an agreement with the us government 
we have received a total of launch assignments from the us government  nine of which are under contract and in backlog 
the launch assignments include seven that were reassigned in from the original eelv competition referred to as buy as a result of our competitor s violation of the procurement integrity act 
two of the seven launch reassignments were for west coast launches and  since then  the air force has assigned us four additional west coast launches 
to prepare for these  we upgraded our west coast launch facilities  which required further investment in the eelv program see note to the financial statements 
we expect to recover the investment through the pricing of the west coast launches 
the us government has been awarding launch missions incrementally as it continues to develop its acquisition strategy for future national missions 
the us government plans to maintain assured access to space to the maximum extent possible and has recognized the need to fund additional eelv infrastructure costs created by the weaker than originally anticipated commercial demand for launch services 
we had three atlas launches in  including our fifth atlas v commercial launch 
as of year end  the atlas family of launch vehicles had a record of consecutive successful launches 
commercial orders and prices for the atlas v launch vehicle to date have been lower than we originally expected during the development phase of the vehicle 
in  we entered into an agreement with boeing to create a joint venture that would combine the production  engineering  test and launch operations associated with us government launches of our atlas launch vehicles and boeing s delta launch vehicles 
the joint venture  named united launch alliance  llc ula  is structured as a joint venture and would be accounted for as an equity investment 
under the terms of the joint venture  atlas and delta expendable launch vehicles would continue to be available as alternatives on 
table of contents individual launch missions 
the agreement also stipulates that  upon closing of the transaction  lockheed martin and boeing will dismiss all claims against each other in the pending civil litigation related to a previous competition for launches under the air force eelv program see note for a discussion of that litigation 
the closing of the ula transaction is subject to conditions to closing  including government and regulatory approvals and agreements in the united states and internationally 
on august   the european commission determined that ula was compatible with european union merger control regulation 
on october   the federal trade commission ftc requested additional information from lockheed martin and boeing related to ula in response to the pre merger notice under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of hsr submitted by the parties 
the ftc s second request extends the period that the ftc is permitted to review the transaction under the hsr act 
we currently plan to close the ula transaction as soon as practicable following satisfaction of all the closing conditions 
we do not expect that its formation will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position for if the conditions to closing are not satisfied and the ula transaction is not consummated by march   either boeing or lockheed martin may terminate the joint venture agreement 
lockheed khrunichev energia international  inc lkei  a joint venture we have with two russian government owned space firms  has exclusive rights to market launches of commercial  non russian origin space payloads on the proton family of rockets from a launch site in kazakhstan 
one of the joint venture partners  khrunichev state research and production space center khrunichev  is the manufacturer of the proton launch vehicle and provider of the related launch services in russia 
commercial atlas and proton launch services are marketed around the world through international launch services ils  a joint venture between lockheed martin and lkei 
we consolidate the results of operations of lkei and ils into our financial statements based on our controlling financial interest 
we received four new awards for launches on proton vehicles in contracts for launch services usually require substantial advances from the customer prior to launch 
at the end of  million of advances received from customers for proton launch services not yet provided was included as a liability in our balance sheet in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred 
a sizeable percentage of the advances we receive from customers for proton launch services are sent to khrunichev 
if a contracted launch service is not provided  a sizeable percentage of the related advance would have to be refunded to our customer 
at year end  payments to khrunichev included in inventories for launches under contract totaled million 
our ability to recover these advances may be affected by khrunichev s ability to provide the launch services  as well as economic conditions and the political environment in russia 
through the end of  launch services through lkei and ils have been provided according to contract terms 
the corporation has entered into an agreement with rd amross  a joint venture of the pratt whitney division of united technologies corporation and the russian firm npo energomash  for the purchase  subject to certain conditions  of rd booster engines for use in the corporation s atlas launch vehicles 
terms of the agreement call for payments to be made to rd amross upon the achievement of certain milestones in the manufacturing process 
payments of million made under this agreement for engines not yet delivered were included in the corporation s inventories at december  
table of contents as discussed above  commercial satellite sales have continued to experience pricing pressures due to excess capacity 
however  in the past two years  we have received six commercial satellite orders and are in active discussions for additional satellite orders 
in addition to commercial activity  we also received new orders for government satellites in and  including those under the muos program and certain classified activities 
other business considerations as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  an indictment of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
a conviction could result in debarment for a specific period of time 
similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business 
although we cannot predict the outcome of these types of investigations and inquiries with certainty  based on current facts  we do not believe that any of the claims  audits or investigations pending against us are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we are exposed to risks associated with us government contracting  including technological uncertainties  dependence on fewer manufacturing suppliers and obsolescence  as well as congressional appropriation and allotment of funds each year 
many of our programs involve the development and application of state of the art technologies aimed at achieving challenging goals 
as a result  setbacks  delays  cost growth and product failures can occur 
we have entered into various joint venture  teaming and other business arrangements to help support our portfolio of products and services in many of our lines of business 
some of these business arrangements include foreign partners 
the conduct of international business introduces other risks into our operations  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign countries and the potential for unanticipated cost increases resulting from the possible deterioration of political relations 
the nature of our international business also makes us subject to the export control regulations of the us department of state and the department of commerce 
if these regulations are violated  it could result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges 
we are currently unaware of any violations of export control regulations which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
critical accounting policies contract accounting revenue recognition a large part of our business is derived from long term contracts for design  development and production activities which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government 
table of contents contractors  and the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we also enter into contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design  development or production activities 
we account for those contracts in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting method for a particular contract 
accounting for design  development and production contracts generally  we record long term  fixed price design  development and production contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
for example  we use this method of revenue recognition on our c j tactical transport aircraft program  atlas and proton launch vehicle programs  and multiple launch rocket system program 
for certain other long term  fixed price development and production contracts that  along with other factors  require us to deliver minimal quantities over a longer period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract  sales are recorded when we achieve performance milestones or using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize sales based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
as examples  we use this methodology for our f raptor program and the aegis weapon system program 
in some instances  long term production programs may require a significant level of development and or a low level of initial production units in their early phases  but will ultimately require delivery of increased quantities in later  full rate production stages 
in those cases  the revenue recognition methodology may change from the cost to cost method to the units of delivery method after considering  among other factors  program and production stability 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record sales 
cost reimbursement type contracts include time and materials and other level of effort type contracts 
examples of this type of revenue recognition include the f joint strike fighter system development and demonstration sdd program and the thaad missile defense program 
most of our long term contracts are denominated in us dollars  including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the us government us  foreign military sales 
as a general rule  we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
incentives and award fees related to performance on design  development and production contracts  which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates 
estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance 
incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not 
table of contents recognized until the event occurs 
such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
accounting for design  development and production contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials  and the availability and timing of funding from the customer 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 
products and services provided under long term design  development and production contracts make up the majority of our business 
therefore  the amounts we record in our financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
for example  if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit at completion for all design  development and production contracts was higher or lower by  our net earnings would increase or decrease by approximately million 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the current period 
accounting for other services contracts revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design  development or production activities is generally recognized either as services are performed or when earned  depending on the contract 
this methodology is mainly used by our information technology services segment 
services contracts primarily include operations and maintenance contracts  and outsourcing type arrangements 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred  except that initial set up costs are capitalized and recognized over the life of the agreement 
operating profit related to such services contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
incentives and award fees related to performance on services contracts are recognized when they are fixed and determinable  generally at the date of award 
other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulations far 
the far provides guidance on the types of 
table of contents costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  advertising  interest expense  and public relations are unallowable  and therefore not recoverable through sales 
in addition  we may enter into agreements with the us government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters 
for example  most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to discontinued operations and sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under agreements reached with the us government 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel assess the status of contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
for other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see our discussion under sales and earnings in note to the financial statements 
postretirement benefit plans most employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans pension plans  and we provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees 
our earnings may be negatively or positively impacted by the amount of expense or income we record for our employee benefit plans 
this is particularly true with expense or income for pension plans because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics 
effective january   new non union represented employees that we hire are not being covered by defined benefit pension plans  but are eligible to participate in defined contribution plans 
we currently plan to offer those employees the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans  but will not subsidize the cost of their participation effective january  we account for our pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards fas  employers accounting for pensions 
those rules require that the amounts we record  including the expense or income for the plans  be computed using actuarial valuations 
these valuations include many assumptions  including assumptions we make relating to financial market and other economic conditions 
changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions we use 
the key year end assumptions used to estimate pension expense or income for the following calendar year are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in future compensation levels 
we use judgment in reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider current market conditions and  in the case of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  past investment experience  judgments about future market trends  changes in interest rates and equity market performance 
we also have to consider factors like the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
an example of how changes in these assumptions can affect our financial statements occurred in we reassess our pension plan assumptions each year 
based on our review of 
table of contents interest rates at the end of the year  we lowered our discount rate assumption to at december   compared to used at the end of before the end of  we also performed a study of the rates of increase in future compensation levels 
the results of that study indicated that it would be appropriate to reduce that rate from to at the end of these changes  together with other factors such as the effects of the actual return on plan assets over the past few years  resulted in our projecting that the amount of pension expense for will decrease by approximately to as compared to expense 
the primary drivers of this projected decrease were the change in the rate of future compensation increases as well as the growth in plan assets over the past year  including contributions we made to the pension trust 
the decrease of basis points in the compensation rate decreased the estimated expense by approximately million 
in addition  the higher asset base at the beginning of drove a higher expected return on assets for  which was the main component of the remaining decrease in the expense 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in the estimated pension expense  resulting from the basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption 
the annual review of our pension plan assumptions also affects the pension liability recorded in our balance sheet 
at the end of each of the last few years  we have recorded noncash after tax adjustments in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet to reflect a minimum pension liability for many of our pension plans 
these adjustments were calculated on a plan by plan basis  and were determined by comparing the accumulated benefit obligation abo for each plan to the fair value of that plan s assets 
the amount by which the abo exceeds the fair value of the plan assets  after adjusting for previously recorded accrued or prepaid pension cost for the plan  must be recorded as a minimum pension liability  with a corresponding increase in an intangible asset  if appropriate  and a reduction to stockholders equity 
in  the minimum pension liability adjustment we recorded reduced stockholders equity by million primarily due to minimum pension liabilities associated with nonqualified benefit plans and the changes in assumptions 
at the end of  the adjustment reduced stockholders equity by million  mainly driven by the change in the discount rate 
these adjustments did not impact earnings 
the accumulated minimum pension liability balances in stockholders equity at the end of and were  million and  million  respectively 
the amount of the minimum pension liability is computed at each year end and could decrease or increase depending on changes in interest rates and other factors 
us government cost accounting standards cas are a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the us government 
funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore are recognized in our net sales 
the total funding requirement for pension plans under cas in was million 
for  we expect our funding requirements under cas to increase 
also in  funding in addition to the amount calculated under cas will likely be required under internal revenue code rules 
any additional amounts computed under those rules are considered to be prepayments under the cas rules  and are recorded on our balance sheet and recovered in future periods 
in and  we made discretionary prepayments of million and million  respectively  to the pension trust 
prepayments reduce the amount of future cash funding that will be required 
accordingly  although our cas funding requirements are expected to increase over the million required in  we expect our cash contributions to the pension plans to be million to million  primarily reflecting the additional funding required under internal revenue code rules 

table of contents the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with fas and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas 
since the cas expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore recognized in a particular segment s net sales  the results of operations of our segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with cas rules 
accordingly  the fas cas adjustment is an amount included in the reconciliation of total segment operating profit to consolidated operating profit under gaap 
see the discussion of net unallocated corporate expense income under discussion of business segments 
in response to the public s concern over the adequacy of pension plan funding  congress has been drafting legislation to address the amount of annual contributions that companies are required to pay into their pension funds 
both the senate and the house of representatives have passed their own versions of a pension funding bill and those bills are expected to go to conference during the latter part of the first quarter of it is expected that the conference process will produce compromises and changes in the senate and house bills  and ultimate passage of a bill is uncertain 
this uncertainty makes it difficult to quantify the potential impact to our pension funding 
generally  the senate and house bills  as drafted  would accelerate the required amount of our annual pension plan contributions  which may have a material impact on our cash flows for a few years beginning in absent other changes  the subsequent annual funding requirements would be expected to decline in recognition of the accelerated contributions 
environmental matters we are a party to various agreements  proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues  including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the epa or by a state agency 
we record financial statement accruals for environmental matters in the period that it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matters in note to the financial statements 
judgment is required when we develop assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to  along with other factors  difficulties in assessing the extent of environmental remediation to be performed  complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies  cost allowability issues and agreements between prps to share in the cost of remediation as discussed below 
we enter into agreements eg  administrative orders  consent decrees which document the extent and timing of our obligation 
we are also involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements exist but do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation 
environmental cleanup activities usually cover several years  which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to  for example  changing remediation technologies 
to determine the costs related to cleanup sites  we have to assess the extent of contamination  the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and continually evolving regulatory environmental standards 
we consider these factors in our estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions 
in cases where a date to complete activities at a particular environmental site cannot be estimated by reference to agreements or otherwise  we project costs over an appropriate time frame not to exceed years 

table of contents given the level of judgment and estimation which has to occur  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards 
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp  we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials 
under existing environmental laws  responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other prps 
the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps  which we are required to pursue by agreement and us government regulation 
under agreements reached with the us government  some of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs 
under existing government regulations  these and other environmental expenditures relating to our us government business  after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services 
as a result  a substantial amount of the expenditures we incur are being included in our sales and cost of sales according to us government agreement or regulation 
at the end of  the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was million 
about of the liability relates to sites in redlands  burbank and glendale  california  and in great neck  new york  mainly for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
the remainder of the liability relates to other properties including current operating facilities and certain facilities operated in prior years for which our obligation is probable and the financial exposure can be estimated 
we have recorded assets totaling million at december  for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for us government businesses 
the amount that is expected to be allocated to our commercial businesses has been expensed through cost of sales 
any recoveries we receive from other prps or insurance would reduce the allocated amounts included in our future us government sales and cost of sales 
acquisition and divestiture activities we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers 
we accomplish this not only internally  through our independent research and development activities  but also through acquisitions 
we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow expansion into adjacent product lines or access to new technologies 
we have made a number of such niche acquisitions of businesses during the past several years 
over the last five years  we have completed such acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion 
conversely  we may also explore the sale of businesses  investments and surplus real estate 
if we were to decide to sell any such businesses or real estate  the resulting gains  if any  would be recorded when the transactions are consummated and losses  if any  would be recorded when the value of the related asset is determined to be impaired 

table of contents acquisitions in  we completed the purchase of the sytex group  inc sytex 
the total purchase price  including transaction related costs  was approximately million 
approximately million of the purchase price was paid in cash at closing  with most of the remainder payable in the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
purchase accounting adjustments were recorded by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  and included recording goodwill of million  of which million will be amortized for tax purposes 
the acquisition expands the corporation s information technology solutions and technical support services businesses with the dod and other federal agencies 
the operations of sytex are included in the information technology services business segment 
in  we also completed the acquisitions of stasys limited  a uk based technology and consulting firm specializing in network communications and defense interoperability  insys group limited  a uk based diversified supplier of military communications systems  weapons systems and advanced analysis services  and coherent technologies  inc  a us based supplier of high performance  laser based remote sensing systems 
the aggregate cash purchase price for these three acquisitions was million 
purchase accounting adjustments included recording combined goodwill of million 
these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated results of operations for in january  we acquired aspen systems corporation  a us based company that provides a range of business process and technology solutions primarily to civil agencies of the us government 
this acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
divestitures during and  we continued to execute the strategy to monetize certain of our equity investments  as follows in january  we completed the sale of our interest in intelsat  ltd 
to a private equity firm for per share  or million in total proceeds 
the transaction resulted in the recording of a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income and expenses  and an increase in net earnings of million per share 
in june  inmarsat plc inmarsat  a company in which we held a interest  completed an initial public offering ipo of million of its ordinary shares on the london stock exchange 
the ipo had the effect of diluting our ownership to and was the primary driver for our recognition of a million deferred gain that was recorded in related to this investment 
in october  we sold approximately million of our inmarsat shares for million  further reducing our ownership percentage to 
these transactions resulted in the recording of gains  net of state income taxes  totaling million in other income and expenses  and an increase in net earnings of million per share 
at december   we held million shares of inmarsat with a total market value of million 
in january  we sold an additional million shares of inmarsat for million 
the gain is expected to increase net earnings by million per share 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our interest in neustar  inc the transaction resulted in the recording of a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income and expenses  and an increase in net earnings of million per share 
in november  a private equity firm purchased the outstanding shares of new skies satellites  nv new skies

the transaction resulted in the recording of a gain  net of state income taxes  of million in other income and expenses  and an increase in net earnings of million per share 
the carrying value of our investment in new skies was marked to market through other comprehensive income prior to the sale 
results of operations since our operating cycle is long term and involves many types of development and production contracts with varying production delivery schedules  the results of operations of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
all per share amounts cited in this discussion are presented on a per diluted share basis 
net sales in billions logo the following discussion of net sales and operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements set forth in our statement of earnings 
the discussion of business segments which follows  describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated sales and operating profit for  and we follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our businesses and generally focus the discussion of our results of operations around major lines of business  versus distinguishing between products and services 
as mentioned previously  most of our services revenues are generated in our information technology services segment 
for  net sales were billion  a increase over sales 
sales for were billion  an increase of compared to sales  as compared to the prior year  increased in all segments except aeronautics in  where there was a slight decline due to an anticipated reduction in combat aircraft deliveries 
the us government is our largest customer  accounting for about of our sales for  compared to in and in other income and expense  net was million for compared to million in this was due to an increase in investment income  gains from the sale of investments primarily intelsat and inmarsat and charges in for the early retirement of debt 
other income and expenses  net increased million from to due to gains from the sale of the comsat general business and the investment in new skies 

table of contents our operating profit for was billion  an increase of compared to our operating profit for was billion  an increase of compared to interest expense for was million  million lower than in interest expense for was million  million lower than the amount for the decrease in interest expense was due to reductions in our debt outstanding 
our effective tax rates were for  for  and for for each of the three years  our tax rate was reduced from the statutory rate by the tax benefits related to export sales and tax deductible dividends 
for  our tax rate was reduced by the new tax deduction for sales of products manufactured in the us for  our tax rate reflected a million reduction in our income tax expense primarily resulting from the closure of an internal revenue service irs examination 
net earnings increased as compared to the prior year for the fourth straight year 
we reported net earnings of billion per share in  compared to net earnings of billion per share in and earnings of billion per share in discussion of business segments we operate in five business segments aeronautics  electronic systems  space systems  integrated systems solutions is s  and information technology services i ts 
in the aeronautics business segment  sales have leveled compared to the growth that had been experienced the last few years 
this is largely due to lower sales on combat aircraft programs driven by declines in f volume  completion of initial ramp up activities associated with f development and f production  and the completion of the f engineering and manufacturing development emd phase of the program 
the number of f deliveries is expected to continue to decline over the next few years  however  with the greek government s contract authorization for aircraft  firm production is currently planned through during  f s were delivered and the program achieved initial operational capability  indicating its readiness for service 
the lot contract for the production of aircraft is expected to continue production of the f into  and we received advanced procurement contracts for production of lots and associated with long lead activities 
the initial f test aircraft is being readied for its first flight and significant progress is being made on the carrier based and short takeoff variants as well 
activity on the c j program included aircraft deliveries in through  we have delivered of the aircraft under the multi year award  and production and delivery of the remaining multi year aircraft are expected to continue into the electronic systems business segment has a broad portfolio of products and services 
many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules 
this business segment has continued to expand its core competencies as a leading systems integrator  as demonstrated with its role as the prime contractor on the presidential helicopter and littoral combat ship programs 
the space systems business segment is a key supplier of space solutions  primarily to our us government customers 
growth will depend on our government satellite business and our ability to capture market share 
the commercial satellite and launch vehicle industries continue 
table of contents to be very competitive  with resulting pricing pressures 
during  the final titan iv was launched and we now plan to continue to provide launch services to our us government customers with our atlas v vehicle through the eelv program 
the is s and i ts business segments continue to focus their capabilities in providing information technology services to defense  intelligence and other government customers 
we expect continued strong growth in providing information technology solutions to government agencies 
in the following table of financial data  total operating profit of the business segments is reconciled to the corresponding consolidated amount 
the reconciling item net unallocated corporate expense includes the fas cas pension adjustment see discussion below  earnings and losses from equity investments  interest income  costs for certain stock based compensation programs  the effects of items not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance  and corporate costs not allocated to the operating segments  as well as other miscellaneous corporate activities 
the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense or income calculated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with fas  and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with us government cas  which are reflected in the business segment results 
cas is a major factor in determining our pension funding requirements  and governs the extent of allocability and recoverability of pension costs on government contracts 
the cas expense is recovered through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and therefore recognized in segment net sales 
the results of operations of the segments only include pension expense as determined and funded in accordance with cas rules

table of contents the following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment 
total negotiated backlog was approximately billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
this amount included both funded backlog unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not yet been appropriated 
negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
funded backlog was approximately billion at december  the aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments 
therefore  due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments  the discussions of the results of operations of these business segments generally focus on lines of business within the segments rather than on specific programs 
the following tables of financial information and related discussions of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in note to the financial statements 
segment operating profit in millions logo aeronautics aeronautics operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for aeronautics decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease was mainly due to anticipated declines in combat aircraft  which were partially offset by growth in air mobility 
combat aircraft sales decreased by million for the year primarily due to declines in f volume  which more than offset higher f and f volume 
the sales growth in air mobility was due to additional c j deliveries in compared to in and higher volume on other air mobility programs

space systems space systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit backlog at year end net sales for space systems increased by in compared to during the year  sales growth in satellites and strategic defensive missile systems s dms offset declines in launch services 
the million increase in satellites sales was due to higher volume on government satellite programs that more than offset declines in commercial satellite activities 
there were no commercial satellite deliveries in  compared to four in increased sales of million in s dms were attributable to the fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs 
the million decrease in launch services sales was mainly due to having three atlas launches in compared to six in net sales for space systems increased by in compared to  as increases in satellites of million and s dms of million more than offset a million decrease in launch services 
the increase in satellites was due to increased volume on government satellite programs and one additional commercial satellite delivery in in s dms  the increase was primarily attributable to fleet ballistic missile programs

unallocated corporate expense income  net the following table shows the components of net unallocated corporate expense income 
in millions fas cas pension adjustment items not considered in segment operating performance other  net the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas and pension expense determined in accordance with fas that difference is not included in segment operating results and therefore is a reconciling item between operating profit from the business segments and consolidated operating profit 
the cas funding amount is allocated among the business segments and is included as an expense item in the segments cost of goods sold 
a majority of the cost is also passed along to our customers through contract pricing  and is consequently included in the segments sales 

table of contents the following table shows the cas funding that is included as expense in the segments operating results  the related fas expense income  and the resulting fas cas pension adjustment in millions fas expense less cas expense and funding fas cas pension adjustment expense as disclosed in note to the financial statements  fas expense increased primarily due to higher recognized net actuarial losses and higher service cost in  and due to a lower expected return on plan assets in addition to these other two factors in certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach promulgated by fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
for example  gains and losses related to the disposition of businesses or investments managed by corporate  as well as other corporate activities such as charges recorded related to the early repayment of debt  are not considered by management in evaluating the operating performance of business segments 
therefore  for purposes of segment reporting  the following items were included in unallocated corporate expense income  net for  and in millions  except per share data operating profit loss net earnings loss earnings loss per share year ended december  gains related to inmarsat transactions gain on sale of interest in intelsat gain on sale of interest in neustar impairment charge related to a satellite year ended december  charge for pit litigation charge for early retirement of debt gain on sale of interest in new skies gain on sale of comsat general business benefit from closure of an irs examination year ended december  charge for early retirement of debt charge related to exit from the commercial mail sorting business gain on partial reversal of space imaging charge gain on sale of the commercial it business 
table of contents the increase in the other  net component of unallocated corporate expense income  net of million from to was primarily due to higher interest income due to a larger invested cash balance and higher interest rates in the decrease of million from to was primarily due to lower earnings on our equity investments in liquidity and cash flows we have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance our businesses  increase shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise 
consistent with that strategy  we have invested in our business eg  capital expenditures  independent research and development  repurchased shares  increased our dividends  opportunistically reduced our debt and made select acquisitions of businesses 
the following provides an overview of our execution of this strategy 
net cash provided by operating activities in millions logo operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to billion in as compared to after having increased by billion to billion in as compared to in  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings of million as compared to  which more than offset a million reduction in working capital improvements between the years 
in  the increase was attributable to an increase in net earnings of million  and also to an increase in working capital improvements of million compared to the remaining increase in cash between the periods was due to the timing of income tax payments and various other operating activities 
the focus on improving our cash management processes continues to contribute to the aggregate reduction in operating working capital accounts receivables  inventories  accounts payable  and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  including an aggregate reduction of million in as compared to a reduction of million in although we will continue to focus on management of operating working capital accounts  we do not expect the rate of improvements we have experienced in prior periods to continue 
investing activities capital expenditures capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in  million in and million in we expect our capital expenditures to increase over the next two years consistent with the expected growth in our business and to support specific program requirements 

table of contents acquisitions  divestitures and other activities we have a process to selectively identify businesses for acquisition that meet our financial targets and disciplined growth strategy 
we have focused on government information technology providers  systems integrators and complementary technologies 
we paid million for four businesses in  million for two businesses in and million for two businesses in during  we received proceeds of million from the divestiture of non core equity investments 
the proceeds included million from the sale of our investment in intelsat  ltd  million from the sale of inmarsat shares and the redemption of certain inmarsat equity related investments  and million from the sale of our neustar investment 
during  new skies satellites  nv was sold to a private equity firm 
our portion of the proceeds was million  million of which was received in also during  we received cash from inmarsat group holdings  ltd 
amounting to million which reduced the amount of our investment 
in  inmarsat ventures  ltd 
was acquired by a consortium of private equity firms in a leveraged buyout transaction 
in exchange for our interest  we received cash of million and retained an ownership interest in the new inmarsat holding company  inmarsat group holdings  ltd  valued at million 
also in  we paid million related to our guarantee of space imaging  llc s borrowings under its credit facility 
financing activities issuance and repayment of long term debt cash provided from operations has been our principal source of funds to reduce our long term debt 
in  we used million of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long term debt 
in  we used billion of cash for the early retirement and scheduled repayment of long term debt 
of that amount  million related to the early retirement of debt through tender offers for which we incurred million of associated costs 
in  we issued billion of floating rate convertible senior debentures that bear interest at three month libor less basis points  reset quarterly 
we used the proceeds of that issuance  along with cash from operations  to repay billion of debt in advance of its maturity and retire other high cost debt 
we used million of cash for debt issuance and repayment costs to complete those transactions in share repurchases and dividends we also used cash in each of the last three years for common share repurchase activity as follows  million for million common shares in  of which  million for million of those common shares  as well as million for million common shares purchased in  was settled during the year  million for million common shares in  of which million for million common shares was settled during the year  and million in for million common shares 
these purchases were made under a share repurchase program in place for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock from time to time at management s discretion  including million shares that were authorized for repurchase under the program in september as of december   we had repurchased a total of million shares under the program  and there remained approximately million shares that may be repurchased in the future 
the payment of dividends on our common shares is one of the key components of our balanced cash deployment strategy 
shareholders were paid cash dividends of million in  million in and million in we have increased our quarterly 
table of contents dividend rate in each of the last three years 
we paid a quarterly dividend of per share during each of the first three quarters of and per share for the last quarter of we paid a quarterly dividend of per share during each of the first three quarters of and per share for the last quarter of in  we paid quarterly dividends of per share during each of the first three quarters of the year and per share for the last quarter of capital structure and resources at december  our total long term debt amounted to billion 
our long term debt is almost entirely in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures 
the majority of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates  however  billion of convertible debentures issued in have a floating interest rate based on libor 
in  we repaid million of long term debt  including scheduled and early debt repayments 
through our repayment activities  our long term debt balance has declined over the last five years from billion at december  we improved our debt to total capitalization ratio from at december  to at december  debt to total capital ratio logo our stockholders equity amounted to billion at december   an increase of million from december  the increase came from net earnings and stock plan activities partially offset by our share repurchases and payment of dividends 
return on invested capital roic improved by basis points during to 
we define roic as net income plus after tax interest expense divided by average invested capital stockholders equity plus debt  after adjusting stockholder s equity by adding back our minimum pension liability balance 
we believe that reporting roic provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively lockheed martin uses the capital invested in its operations 
we use roic to evaluate multi year investment decisions and as a long term performance measure 
we also use roic as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans 
the adjustment to add back the minimum pension liability is a revision to our calculation in which we believe more closely links roic to management performance 
roic is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the us  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
roic should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance 
see note f to the consolidated financial data five year summary on page of this form k for additional information concerning how we calculate roic 
that information reflects the revision to the calculation as discussed in the preceding paragraph for all periods presented 

table of contents revised return on invested capital ratio logo calculation was revised in see note f to the consolidated financial summary five year summary on page for additional information on the calculation 
at december   we had in place a billion revolving credit facility which expires in july there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility at december  borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based  at our option  on the eurodollar rate or a bank base rate as defined 
each bank s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to  among other things  our compliance with various representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets  and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
we cancelled our million day credit facility on june  we have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at december  if we were to issue commercial paper  the borrowings would be supported by the billion credit facility 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission to provide for the issuance of up to billion in debt securities 
if we were to issue debt under this shelf registration  we would expect to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
these purposes may include repayment of debt  working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and any other general corporate purpose 
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
our management continually reviews changes in financial  market and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts and maturities of our indebtedness 
we may at times refinance existing indebtedness  vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs 
cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash flow from operations and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  as well as acquisition and other discretionary investment needs  projected over the next three years 

table of contents contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had contractual commitments to repay debt  make payments under operating leases  settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services  and settle other long term liabilities 
capital lease obligations were negligible 
payments due under these long term obligations and commitments are as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt a operating lease obligations purchase obligations operating activities capital expenditures other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations a long term debt includes scheduled principal payments only 
generally  our long term debt obligations are subject to  along with other things  compliance with certain covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets 
purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages 
such agreements and contracts may  for example  be related to direct materials  obligations to sub contractors and outsourcing arrangements 
total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our us government customers 
however  the us government would generally be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts for convenience pursuant to far 
for example  if we had commitments to purchase goods and services that were entered into as a result of a specific contract we received from our us government customer and the customer terminated the contract for convenience  any amounts we would be required to pay to settle the related commitments  as well as amounts previously incurred  would generally be reimbursed by the customer 
this would also be true in cases where we perform sub contract work for a prime contractor under a us government contract 
the termination for convenience language may also be included in contracts with foreign  state and local governments 
in addition  we have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions  including contracts with commercial customers 
total purchase obligations in the preceding table related to capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment at various of our locations  related to customer contracts 

table of contents amounts related to other long term liabilities in the preceding table represent the contractual obligations for certain long term liabilities recorded as of december  such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans  non qualified pension plans and environmental liabilities 
obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of remediation payment obligations under government consent decrees and agreements  excluding amounts reimbursed by the us government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party under an agreement entered into in we also may enter into industrial participation agreements  sometimes referred to as offset agreements  as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries 
these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country 
offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transferring technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  and the purchase by third parties eg  our vendors of supplies from in country vendors 
these agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in country vendors  providing financial support for in country projects  and building or leasing facilities for in country operations 
we do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive 
offset programs generally extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements 
no such penalties have been incurred during the last five years 
the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and generally require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement 
at december   we had outstanding offset agreements totaling billion  primarily related to our aeronautics segment  that extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at december  that also satisfy offset agreements  those amounts are included in the preceding table 
we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers mainly relating to advances received from customers and or the guarantee of future performance on some of our contracts 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees  as follows commitment expiration by period in millions total commitment less than year a years a years after years standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total commitments a approximately  million and million of standby letters of credit in the less than year and year periods  respectively  and approximately million of surety bonds in the less than year period  are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation 
included in the table above is approximately million representing letter of credit and surety bond amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded in the balance sheet  either as reductions of inventories  as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs 
table of contents incurred  or as other liabilities 
approximately billion of the standby letters of credit in the table above were to secure advance payments received under an f contract from an international customer 
these letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance  and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms 
similar to the letters of credit for the f contract  other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance 
at december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as those arrangements are defined by the securities and exchange commission sec 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate and floating rate long term debt 
if interest rates were to change by plus or minus  interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million related to our floating rate debt 
the estimated fair values of the corporation s long term debt instruments at december  aggregated approximately billion  compared with a carrying amount of approximately billion 
the majority of our long term debt obligations are not callable until maturity 
we have used interest rate swaps in the past to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates  however  at year end  we had no such agreements in place 
we use forward foreign exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and do so in ways that qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
these exchange contracts hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies  or hedge the exposure to rate changes affecting foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities 
related gains and losses on these contracts  to the extent they are effective hedges  are recognized in income at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized or when the hedged asset or liability is adjusted 
to the extent the hedges are ineffective  gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in the current period 
at december   the fair value of forward exchange contracts outstanding  as well as the amounts of gains and losses recorded during the year then ended  were not material 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fas r  share based payments  which will impact our net earnings and earnings per share and change the classification of certain elements of the statement of cash flows 
fas r requires stock options and other share based payments made to employees to be accounted for as compensation expense and recorded at fair value  and to reflect the related excess tax benefit received upon exercise of the options  if any  in the statement of cash flows as a financing activity inflow rather than an adjustment of operating activity as currently presented 
we currently use the black scholes model to compute the fair value of our stock options in connection with our disclosure of the pro forma effects on net earnings and earnings per share as if compensation cost had been recognized for such options at the date of grant see note to the financial statements 

table of contents we adopted fas r  and related sec rules included in sab no 
 on a modified prospective basis effective january  we will continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted subsequent to the date of adoption 
the lockheed martin amended and restated incentive performance award plan provides for the grant of various types of stock based incentive awards  including options to purchase common stock  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock and stock units 
the types and mix of stock based incentive awards are evaluated on an ongoing basis and may vary based on management s overall strategy regarding compensation  including consideration of the impact of the expensing of stock option awards on our results of operations subsequent to the adoption of fas r 
based on current analyses and information  we expect that the combination of expensing stock options upon adoption of fas r in and grants of restricted stock units will result in additional expense  net of state income tax benefits  totaling approximately million or a reduction in net earnings per share of on a full year basis 
we also adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 in the fourth quarter of fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  and requires that a liability and a corresponding increase in the value of the underlying asset be recorded  and depreciation on the increased asset value be expensed  if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by fin are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  even though the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an example of a condition giving rise to an asset retirement obligation is the presence of embedded asbestos  radiation sources or other regulated materials in buildings or equipment 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
this is primarily due to the fact that the fair values of the majority of our asset retirement obligations could not be reasonably estimated because they had indeterminate settlement dates  since the range of time over which we may settle the obligations is unknown and could not be estimated 
consistent with the provisions of fin  each obligation will be recorded at the time the settlement date is no longer indeterminate and the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this fsp provides specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy to eligible sponsors of retiree health care benefits provided under this law 
using this guidance  we estimated a projected reduction in our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  of million from the effects of the new law 
this obligation will be recognized over the remaining service lives of the employees eligible for the benefit 
in january  the center for medicare and medicaid services released regulations governing the application of the law and continued to provide clarifying guidance during based on this guidance  the impact of adoption of the fsp was a reduction of the fas postretirement expense for the year ended december  of approximately million 
the postretirement expense computed under fas does not include the effects of us government cost accounting standards or income tax benefits 
the adoption of the fsp did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the year ended december  
table of contents controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic filings with the sec is reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly executed and recorded

in designing and evaluating such controls and procedures  we recognize that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and management necessarily is required to use its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 
also  we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities 
as we do not control or manage these entities  our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries 
we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency  while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment 
changes may include such activities as implementing new  more efficient systems  consolidating the activities of two or more business units  and migrating certain processes to our shared services centers 
in addition  when we acquire new businesses  we review the controls and procedures of the acquired business as part of our integration activities 
we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures  including internal control over financial reporting  as of december  the evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions  and under the supervision of the ceo and cfo 
based on our evaluation  we concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december  during  we also performed a separate evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  including performing self assessment and monitoring procedures 
based on those activities and other evaluation procedures  our management  including the ceo and cfo  concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  management s report on our financial statements and internal control over financial reporting appears on page in addition  both our assessment and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting were audited by our independent registered public accounting firm
