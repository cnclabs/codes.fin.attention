summary of products and segments we are a leading supplier of products that enable the research  development and manufacturing of nanoscale features by helping our customers understand their three dimensional structures 
we serve the semiconductor  data storage and industry and institute markets where decreasing feature sizes and the need for sub surface  structural information drive the need for our equipment and services 
our products and systems include hardware and software for focused ion beams  or fibs  scanning electron microscopes  or sems  transmission electron microscopes  or tems  and dualbeam systems  which combine a fib and sem on a single platform  as well as cad navigation and yield management software 
tems and sems comprise our electron optics segment products 
dualbeam systems  fibs and cad navigation and yield management software products collectively comprise our microelectronics segment products 
our dualbeam systems include models that have wafer handling capability that are purchased by semiconductor manufacturers wafer level dualbeam systems and models that have small stages and are sold to customers in several markets small stage dualbeam systems 
during  we introduced a new ultra high resolution scanning tem  or s tem  the titan 
overview our consolidated bookings and revenues declined in compared with the most significant weakness in customer demand in was in the semiconductor market  which experienced weakness throughout bookings from semiconductor customers decreased in compared to bookings from the industry and institute market increased in compared to  primarily as a result of successful new product introductions 
this market continued to be affected  however  by a slow down in growth in united states government funding of nanotechnology research 
bookings from the data storage market were relatively flat  with a decrease in compared to by product  bookings strength continued to come from our transmission electron microscopes 
shipments of our new titan s tem began in the third quarter of the strength in tem demand was offset by weakness in several other product areas  most notable in wafer level dualbeam systems and small stage dualbeam systems 
we experienced significant losses in this was primarily a result of the actions we took related to the weak performance of our semiconductor businesses and their related markets  which precipitated our decision to execute an extensive restructuring plan to consolidate operations  including the closure of our peabody  massachusetts plant 
we believe the actions taken are essentially complete with the exception of some additional costs to be incurred related to european sales office consolidation  which is expected to be completed in the first half of our financial results for reflected the following included in cost of sales were million of inventory write downs related to portions of our semiconductor businesses and to the closure of our peabody  massachusetts facility  which primarily manufactured and supported products sold to semiconductor markets  as well as capitalized software impairment charges related to certain semiconductor products  included as a separate component of operating expenses were million of asset impairments primarily related to semiconductor business and the write off of all costs related to our enterprise resource planning erp system as we discontinued its implementation  included as a separate component of operating expenses was million of restructuring charges  primarily for severance  lease terminations and relocation expenses for fei company and subsidiaries part ii item management s discussion and analysis continued the closure of our peabody facility and consolidation of certain of our european facilities  included as a component of other expense  net were charges totaling million for realized losses on our investments in privately held companies and the write down to fair value of certain of these investments for which we concluded an other than temporary impairment existed  and our tax expense primarily consisted of million in expense related to the establishment of valuation allowances against the united states deferred tax assets  which offset the benefit from united states net operating losses generated in additionally  we had approximately million of foreign tax expense  which was offset by a net current tax benefit of million primarily related to tax audit settlements in the united states 
combined  these charges totaled million in outlook for beginning in  we will report our revenue based on the market focused organization that we put into place in our semiconductor and data storage markets will be reported together as nanoelectronics and our industry and institute market will be broken into nanoresearch and industrial and nanobiology markets 
while was a difficult year for our semiconductor market products  our bookings in the fourth quarter of were up from the third quarter of and we built backlog in this market in the second half of accordingly  we expect an improvement in this market going into we also expect continued momentum for our data storage tools in the first half of as the technology transition from longitudinal recording devices to perpendicular recording devices accelerates 
lastly  we expect continued strength in all of our markets for our tem product line in we expect our gross margins to improve in compared to as a result of the conclusion to our restructuring efforts  including the closure of our peabody facility  increased sales volume and a more linear shipping schedule 
additionally  we do not anticipate inventory write down charges to the magnitude experienced in that negatively affected our gross margins 
our operating expenses are expected to decline due to reduced restructuring and related charges  but these decreases will be offset by increased stock based compensation costs in accordance with sfas r 
it is possible that our operating results in coming quarters could be affected somewhat by volatility in exchange rates 
however  with our hedging program  we are better able to match realized gains and losses pertaining to these derivative contracts with the actual economic gains and losses of the underlying hedge transaction in the appropriate line items of our statement of operations

net sales decreased million  or  to million  in compared to million in the decrease in net sales was driven primarily by the slow down in the semiconductor industry  which resulted in lower sales volumes in our semiconductor products within the microelectronics segment 
these sales declines were offset by higher service revenue in as described more fully below 
net sales increased million  or  to million  in compared to million in the increase in net sales was driven primarily by increased sales to the microelectronics segment  due to stronger semiconductor industry conditions in fei company and subsidiaries compared to  as well as increased electron optics segment sales from nanotechnology research  which are described more fully below 
net sales by segment net sales include sales in our microelectronics  electron optics  components and service segments 
net sales by segment in thousands and as a percentage of total sales were as follows year ended december  microelectronics   electron optics   service    components    microelectronics the million  or  decrease in microelectronics sales in compared to primarily was due to the weakness in the semiconductor equipment market in  as well as in the data storage market in the second half of  which resulted in fewer units sold in compared to  particularly our circuit edit and mask repair tools 
the weaknesses in the semiconductor and data storage markets were partially offset by strong semiconductor equipment sales from our backlog in the first quarter of  primarily of our wafer level dualbeam systems 
small stage dualbeam system sales in were slightly lower than in mainly due to product mix 
the million  or  increase in microelectronics sales in compared to primarily was due to increased capital spending by the semiconductor industry  which positively affected unit sales of our mm defect analysis tools and of our newer small stage dualbeam systems 
we also had improvements in sales of our circuit edit and mask repair tools in compared to in addition  we had million of software sales related to our knights technology software purchased as the egsoft division of electroglas in the third quarter of in  compared to million in electron optics the million  or  decrease in our electron optics segment in compared to primarily was due to our exit from the sims business line in the second quarter of  mostly offset by increased demand for our tem products and our environmental sem esem products  which were introduced in the first quarter of the esem products allow for a broader range of samples to be analyzed 
we also began shipping our titan s tem product in the third quarter of  which co ntributed to the offsetting factors 
the selling prices for our new s tem products are generally higher than the existing line of tem products 
the increase in selling prices was partially offset by an approximately decrease in tem unit sales 
the million  or  increase in our electron optics segment in compared to primarily was due to unit increases in sales of our sem products and increased sales of our higher end tem products  which were partially driven by increased spending in the research market and improved product positioning 
service the million  or  increase in our service segment revenue in compared to  as well as the million  or  increase in compared to  primarily were due to continued expansion of our installed base 
service sales are driven by the size of our installed base and the percentage of our installed base that is more than one year old  as our warranty period is typically one year 
customers usually enter into service contracts after the warranty expires 
components our component sales  which comprised less than of our net sales from to  tend to follow the cyclical pattern of the semiconductor equipment business 
certain of our component sales include equipment refurbishment 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to the slow down in the semiconductor equipment business and increased product reliability  which has caused refurbishment revenue to decline 
sales from our component segment were flat in compared to as improvements in the semiconductor equipment business  primarily in the first three quarters of  were offset by a longer product life for our products 
net sales by geographic region a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from customers outside of the united states  which we expect to continue 
the following table shows our net sales by geographic location dollars in thousands year ended december  north america    europe    asia pacific region   fei company and subsidiaries part ii item management s discussion and analysis continued north america sales in north america decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to softness in the semiconductor industry  a slow down in growth of united states government funding for nanotechnology research in the industry and institute market and inefficiencies in our sales force due to organizational changes 
these declines were partially offset by growth in our service revenues 
the million  or  increase in sales in north america in compared to primarily was due to the improvement in the semiconductor industry  which positively affected unit sales of our mm defect analysis tools and of our small stage dualbeam systems 
also  with the increase in our installed base  service revenues increased in compared to we also had increases in sales of our mask repair and circuit edit tools in compared to in addition  we had million of knights technology software sales in  compared to million in and  virtually all sales from our components segment are in the united states 
europe the million  or  increase in sales in europe in compared to was primarily due to sales of our titan s tem products  which began shipping in the third quarter of  sales of our esem products  which began shipping in the first quarter of  and increases in our other sem products 
increased service revenue also contributed to the growth 
there were no appreciable effects on revenue in europe from currency exchange rates 
the million  or  increase in sales in europe in compared to primarily was due to an increase in nanotechnology spending  better customer reception of our higher end tem products  increased service revenue  due to the increase in our installed base  and currency fluctuations 
these increases were partially offset by a large circuit edit sale in that did not repeat in the increase of the value of european currencies against the united states dollar increased sales by approximately million in asia pacific region sales in the asia pacific region decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to a decline in wafer level dualbeam system sales as a result of the weakness in the semiconductor industry during and our exit from the sims business in the second quarter of service revenue increases offset these declines in part 
the million  or  increase in sales in the asia pacific region in compared to primarily was due to increases in unit sales of our small stage dualbeam systems and our sem products 
during the second half of  sales to the south korean market increased significantly 
these increases were partially offset by a large data storage sale in that did not repeat in net sales by market net sales by market and as a percentage of total sales were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  industry and institute   semiconductor    data storage    industry and institute product sales to the industry and institute market primarily consist of sems  tems and small stage dualbeam systems 
customers in this market include universities  research institutes and corporate research and development labs 
in addition  this market serves life sciences customers who are utilizing pathology applications of our tems and sems 
within the industry and institute market  we see opportunity for increased sales related to applications in life sciences and nanotechnology 
also  since the introduction of our small stage dualbeam systems in mid  we penetrated some customers who were previously using sem tools 
these products  which provide a broader range of solutions for our customers  provide greater gross margins than our sem products 
sales in the industry and institute market increased million  or  in compared to due primarily to sales of our new titan s tem products and sales of our esem products  which have higher average selling prices than other products in this market 
in addition  there was a slight increase in the number of units sold in compared to these increases were partially offset by decreased demand due to a slow down in growth of united states government funding for nanotechnology research 
the million  or  increase in sales to the industry and institute market in compared to primarily was due to an increase in unit sales of our sem  tem and small dualbeam products  attributed to increased nanotechnology research spending by governments  universities and industry in both the united states and europe 
sales of our small stage dualbeam line of products  especially the nova nanolab  as well as our higher end tem products were especially strong 
semiconductor product sales to the semiconductor market includes both wafer level and small stage dualbeam systems  defect analysis tools  mask repair and circuit editing fib and dualbeam tools  as well as a number of component products 
sales in the semiconductor market decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to weakness in the global semiconductor markets  which resulted in fewer units sold in fei company and subsidiaries compared to  particularly in our circuit edit and mask repair tools 
we converted a significant amount of our backlog to revenue in the first quarter of  which helped to ease the decrease related to this weakness 
our semiconductor backlog recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter of the million  or  increase in sales to the semiconductor market in compared to primarily was due to the increase in unit sales of our small stage dualbeam systems  as well as increases in sales of our defect analysis tools 
tem sales to semiconductor customers also improved significantly in the fourth quarter of  as did sales of our defect analysis and small dualbeam products 
in addition  we had million of revenue in related to our knights technology software  compared to million in data storage product sales to the data storage market primarily consist of wafer and slider level dualbeam systems and small stage dualbeam systems and tems 
sales in the data storage market decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to fewer orders as a result of the industry s timing of purchases and a shift to higher recording density technology 
revenue in the data storage market comes from only a few customers and  therefore  the timing of orders can lead to significant variances in sales from period to period 
we anticipate future growth as data storage manufacturing technology continues to evolve 
the million  or  increase in data storage sales in compared to primarily was due to increases in unit sales of our certus product in the first two quarters of  which we began selling in the second half of fiscal cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales includes manufacturing costs  such as materials  labor both direct and indirect and factory overhead  as well as all of the costs of our customer service function such as labor  materials  travel and overhead 
we see four primary drivers affecting gross margin product mix including the effect of price competition  volume  cost reduction efforts and currency fluctuations 
cost of sales remained relatively flat with a decrease of million  or  to million in compared to million in compared to year over year revenue decreases of approximately 
expected volume related cost of sales decreases were more than offset by the following additional expenses an million charge for the write down of inventory in related to portions of our semiconductor businesses and to the closure of our peabody  massachusetts facility  which primarily manufactured and supported products sold to semiconductor markets 
in response to the declining product demand  which continued throughout  management decided to restructure these businesses  which included lowering demand expectations and accepting a significant price adjustment below cost to complete a sale on a product that we were de emphasizing in the market place 
by comparison  there were million of inventory write downs in  a million impairment charge for capitalized software in related to semiconductor products compared to no such charge in  realized losses from our cash flow hedges totaling million in  which had limited offsetting benefit from currency movements in cost of sales compared to a realized gain of million in  which was somewhat offset the impact of currency movements on cost of sales in  and an approximately million increase in cost of sales due to an increase in service parts costs in compared to cost of sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase primarily was due to the increases in sales volume and the effects of currency fluctuations related to our manufacturing operations in brno  czech republic  and eindhoven  the netherlands  which is where our electron optics products  our small stage dualbeam systems and certain of our defect analysis tools are manufactured 
our gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales by segment was as follows year ended december  microelectronics electron optics components service overall gross margins decreased in compared to by approximately percentage points largely due to the items discussed above 
a shift in mix to more electron optics and service sales and fewer microelectronics sales as a percentage of our total sales also contributed to the decrease in the overall gross margin  as sales from those segments have lower gross margins than our microelectronics sales 
the products in our microelectronics segment generally have higher average sales prices and a higher gross profit than the products in our other segments 
our overall gross margin as a percentage of sales in compared to increased slightly  primarily due to the increase in gross margin in the microelectronics segment  as well as the increase in microelectronics sales as a percentage of total sales 
our gross margins also benefited from increased utilization in our european manufacturing sites in the second half of this was offset  in part  by lower than expected utilization of our united states manufacturing facilities 
our overall gross margin in was reduced by approximately percentage points due to currency effects  net of the benefits of our hedges 
fei company and subsidiaries part ii item management s discussion and analysis continued compared to by product segment microelectronics the decrease in gross margin in the microelectronics segment primarily was due to the charges related to asset impairment and write downs discussed above  which decreased our gross margin by percentage points  partially offset by a shift in product mix 
electron optics the increase in margins in our electron optics segment in compared to primarily was due to a shift in mix to our titan s tem products and our esem products  which have higher margins than other products in this segment 
the impact of the relative change in the united states dollar compared to european currencies without giving effect to our foreign currency hedges was not significant in compared to components the decrease in margins in our components segment in compared to primarily was due to a shift in mix between new component sales versus component refurbishments  as well as an overall decrease in volume to cover fixed costs 
the margins on our refurbishment work are typically greater than those on our new components 
service the decrease in margins in our service segment in compared to was primarily due to higher parts costs in the service organization as a percentage of revenues in compared to the increase in parts costs was the result of general price increases and increased parts usage for products under service contracts 
compared to by product segment the manufacturing operations for many of our microelectronics and electron optics products are located in europe  and  as the dollar weakened in in relation to the euro and czech koruna  our expenses in these locations increased  and our margins were negatively impacted 
in addition  our electron optics segment experienced pricing pressures from competitors  such as jeol ltd 
and seiko instruments inc  which have introduced new products into our markets or which have benefited from favorable currency exchange movements in their countries 
microelectronics the increase in gross margin in the microelectronics segment in compared to primarily was due to an improvement in product mix with an increasing percentage of sales generated by our higher margin small stage dualbeam systems and our defect analysis tools 
in addition  the increase in our software sales as a percentage of total sales in compared to also increased our gross margin 
production efficiencies were also realized as our production volumes increased 
the improvements in margin were partially offset by an approximately percentage point decrease in in our gross margin due to the relative decline in the united states dollar compared to european currencies without giving effect to our foreign currency hedges related to our manufacturing operations in brno  czech republic  and eindhoven  the netherlands 
our small stage dualbeam systems and certain of our defect analysis tools are manufactured in those locations 
electron optics the decrease in margins in our electron optics segment in compared to primarily was due to a percentage point decrease in margins related to the relative decline in the united states dollar compared to european currencies without giving effect to our foreign currency hedges  partially offset by a shift in mix to higher margin sem and tem products and production efficiencies realized as our production volumes increased 
components the decrease in margin in our components segment primarily was due to a decrease in units produced  as well as a shift in mix of component products produced in compared to these decreases were magnified by the fact that our components revenue was only million in service the decrease in margins in our service segment in compared to primarily was due to increases in parts  labor and travel related expenses to support our products introduced in  including the certus products  our small stage dualbeam systems and our clm d metrology systems in both the united states and europe 
we increased headcount in the service segment of our business by approximately  or people  in compared to research and development costs research and development r d costs include labor  materials  overhead and payments to philips and other third parties for research and development of new products and new software or enhancements to existing products and software and are presented net of subsidies received for such efforts 
r d costs were million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in and million of net sales in r d costs are reported net of subsidies and capitalized software development costs as follows in thousands year ended december  gross spending    less subsidies    less capitalized software  net expense    r d costs increased approximately million in compared to the increase was a result of a decrease in subsidies and capitalizations of million and million  respectively  and an increase in facilities and outside services of million and million  respectively 
these factors were partially offset by decreases in labor and related expenses of million 
r d costs increased approximately million in compared to approximately million of the increase in compared to was as a result of our acquisitions of knights technology in the third quarter of and of emispec systems  inc in the fourth quarter of increases in labor and related costs  exclusive of our knights technology and emispec acquisitions  added an additional million in expense 
we also had a million increase in material consumption in compared to and a million increase in software application development 
included in the above increases  fei company and subsidiaries as well as other components of r d  is a total of million of expense related to the impact that the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro had on r d activities in europe 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest in r d at a similar percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  as revenues increase  we currently anticipate that r d expenditures also will increase 
actual future spending  however  will depend on market conditions 
selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative sg a costs include labor  travel  outside services and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  management and administrative support functions 
sg a costs also include sales commissions paid to our employees as well as to our agents 
sg a costs were million of net sales in compared to million of net sales in and million of net sales in sg a costs increased million in compared to increased compensation and related payroll costs contributed million to the increase in compared to increases in information technology costs contributed million and increased consulting charges contributed million to the increase in compared to these increases were partially offset by a million gain on the sale of our sims product line in the second quarter of  a corresponding decrease in sg a related to sims of million and a million decrease in it equipment rental expense 
sg a costs increased million in compared to due to an approximately million increase associated with regulatory requirements  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and a million increase in labor related costs  including sales commissions and bonuses 
sg a costs also increased approximately million in compared to due to our acquisition of knights technology during the third quarter of included in the above increases  as well as other components of sg a  is a total of million related to the weakening of the united states dollar in relation to the euro 
amortization of purchased technology amortization of purchased technology was million in  million in and million in in  we recorded an impairment charge of million against our purchased technology balance 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in compared to was due to the acquisitions of knights technology and revise inc during the third quarter of and emispec in the fourth quarter of our purchased technology balance at december  was million and current amortization of purchased technology is approximately million per quarter  which could increase if we acquire additional technology 
purchased in process research and development no purchased in process research and development charges were recorded in or the million of purchased in process research and development in relates to the write off of certain in process technology purchased in connection with the acquisition of knights technology and revise in the third quarter of the knights technology acquisition in process research and development relates to next generation computer aided design navigation software 
this software was approximately complete upon acquisition  and became ready for market in late the revise acquisition in process research and development related to circuit edit applications 
this project was approximately complete upon acquisition 
in  this project was determined to have no future value 
asset impairment in  we took certain actions to align our cost structure with the current prevailing market conditions  primarily in the semiconductor markets 
the actions taken to date  which were necessary as a result of reduced business volumes  have resulted in decreases in our global workforce and also required us to evaluate our goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment 
we recorded asset impairment charges and write offs totaling million in these charges are summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  purchased technology  property  plant and equipment  erp system abandonment  patents and other intangible assets our goodwill impairment analysis was focused on goodwill related to our microelectronics segment  which primarily sells to the semiconductor market 
based on our analysis of current and projected operating results  we concluded that the goodwill allocated to this segment was not impaired 
however  we evaluated the recoverability of the segment s long lived assets and concluded impairments existed 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges based on the amounts by which the carrying amounts of these assets exceeded their fair value 
additionally  certain assets were abandoned and  accordingly  written off  including a charge for costs capitalized for the terminated erp project 
restructuring  reorganization and relocation during  we initiated global restructuring activities to realign our cost structure with current prevailing market conditions 
these actions included reductions in workforce  reorganization and relocation of employees as well as closure of our peabody  massachusetts facility and certain field offices around the world 
some of these actions were initiated in the second quarter of with the remainder continuing through the first half of these costs are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting fei company and subsidiaries part ii item management s discussion and analysis continued for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized and measured at fair value in the period the liability is incurred 
in  we expensed million in severance and relocation costs related to workforce reductions and reallocation of personnel geographically  which is included as a component of restructuring  reorganization and relocation expense 
we also incurred million of restructuring expense for facility closures  largely related to the peabody facility inclusive of million in reserve releases related to prior accruals for another facility lease that was terminated 
the expected remaining costs are estimated to be approximately million  primarily for facility closure charges to be incurred in the first half of cash expenditures are expected to continue through the lease expiration dates ending in our restructuring accrual as of december  contains no significant amounts related to our prior years restructuring activities due to either the culmination of our contractual obligations or our ability to negotiate termination of the lease obligations 
the net impact of the lease terminations was insignificant to overall estimated lease abandonment costs accrued 
the current estimate accrued for cash to be paid related to abandoned leases of million is net of estimated sublease payments to be received and will be paid over the respective lease terms 
the following table summarizes the charges  expenditures and write offs and adjustments in related to our restructuring  reorganization and relocation accruals in thousands year ended december  beginning accrued liability charged to expense expenditures write offs adjustments ending accrued liability severance  outplacement and related benefits for terminated employees   abandoned leases  leasehold improvements and facilities   the restructuring charges are based on estimates that are subject to change 
workforce related charges could change because of shifts in timing  redeployment or changes in amounts of severance and outplacement benefits 
facilities charges could change due to changes in sublease income 
our ability to generate sublease income is dependent upon lease market conditions at the time we negotiate the sublease arrangements 
variances from these estimates could alter our ability to achieve anticipated expense reductions in the planned timeframe and modify our expected cash outflows and working capital 
in addition to the charges in connection with our restructuring and reorganization plans  this line item includes costs related to relocating current employees 
relocation costs totaled million in  million in and in the million restructuring charge recorded in was to accrue for costs related to an operating lease for a building we abandoned in the second quarter of other income expense  net other income expense items include interest income  interest expense  foreign currency gains and losses and other miscellaneous items 
interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities and a shareholder note receivable 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to was the result of higher interest rates on investments and a higher percent of investments to cash in compared to our repurchase of million of our convertible subordinated notes during the second quarter of decreased interest income in the second half of compared to what it would have been without the repurchase 
see the section titled liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of the changes in our cash and investment balances during the increase in interest income in compared to was primarily due to increased average cash and investment balances  which were the result of our receipt of net proceeds of million from our zero coupon convertible debt offering in june  offset by the million used for the redemption of a portion of our convertible note and million used for the purchase of a convertible note hedge related to the zero coupon convertible debt offering 
interest expense for  and primarily related to our convertible debt issued in august the amortization of capitalized note issuance costs related to both of our convertible note issuances is also included as a component of interest expense in all periods 
in connection with our repurchase of million of our convertible subordinated notes during the second quarter of  we expensed million of deferred note issuance costs and million of premiums and commissions as a component of interest expense 
as a result of this repurchase  our interest expense will decrease in future periods 
assuming no further repurchases  amortization of our remaining convertible note issuance costs will total approximately million per quarter through interest expense in also included the write off of million of note issuance costs and million for the fei company and subsidiaries premium paid on the redemption of million of our convertible debt in june other  net  primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses on transactions and realized and unrealized gains and losses on the changes in fair value of derivative contracts entered into to hedge these transactions 
other  net in includes a charge of million related to impairment charges and realized losses of certain of our cost method investments 
our cost method investments are holdings in small  privately held entities where it is not practical to estimate fair values 
we evaluate our cost method investments for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable within a reasonable period of time 
this evaluation is based on review of interim financial statements and informal discussions with the senior management of the investee entities 
given the nature of these holdings and the environment in which they operate  we may identify additional other than temporary impairments in subsequent periods  which would require us to write one or more investments down to fair market value 
the million loss in primarily relates to a loss on our forward extra contracts in the first quarter of  which was prior to our achieving hedge treatment of such contracts 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million gain on such contracts 
currency related losses totaled million in  million in and million in in addition  beginning in july  we entered into various forward exchange contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in the euro against the dollar on our manufacturing and operating expenses in europe 
prior to achieving hedge treatment of such contracts in the second quarter of  we marked to market any contracts that were not realized in a given quarter 
the realized and unrealized gains related to these contracts totaled million in see liquidity and capital resources below for a discussion of the changes in our cash and investment balances during see also item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk below for a discussion of our foreign currency gains and losses and hedging activities 
income tax expense we recorded tax expense of million  million and million  respectively  in  and our tax expense primarily consisted of million in expense related to establishment of valuation allowances against the united states deferred tax assets  which offset the benefit from united states net operating losses generated in additionally  we had approximately million of foreign tax expense  which was offset by a net current tax benefit of million primarily related to tax audit settlements in the united states 
valuation allowances on deferred tax assets totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
for  we experienced an abnormally high effective tax rate as we had profits and related tax expense from our international operations  but losses in the united states for which we did not record a tax benefit 
we are currently taking actions to improve the profitability of the united states operations through tax planning strategies and cost reductions that may allow us to recognize future united states deferred tax assets  possibly as early as fiscal  which would result in an effective tax rate of approximately for however  this situation could continue in and beyond if we do not improve the profitability of the united states operations or develop a tax strategy that will be able to utilize the benefits of our net operating losses for tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources as of december  consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents  short term restricted cash and short term investments  million in non current investments  million of long term restricted cash  million of available borrowings under our existing credit facilities  as well as potential future cash flows from operations 
restricted cash relates to deposits to back bank guarantees for customer prepayments that expire through we believe that these sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to meet our expected operational and capital needs through at least in  cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december  primarily as a result of the use of million for the repurchase of million of our subordinated notes  million used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  million used for the purchase of cost method investments and the negative impact of currency exchange rate changes of million 
these decreases were partially offset by million provided by operations  million of proceeds related to the termination of our convertible note hedge  million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases and net sales of investments in marketable securities of million 
accounts receivable decreased million to million as of december  from million as of december   primarily due to reduced revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of this balance was also affected by a million decrease related to changes in currency exchange rates 
our days sales outstanding  calculated on a quarterly basis  was days at december  compared to days at december  inventories decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease primarily was due to currency movements of approximately million  the sims asset disposal of million and inventory write offs of million  partially offset by a build up of inventory to replenish supplies after stronger than fei company and subsidiaries part ii item management s discussion and analysis continued anticipated sales in the fourth quarter of and build up to support the new tem products 
our annualized inventory turnover rate  calculated on a quarterly basis  was times for the quarter ended december  and times for the quarter ended december  expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million in primarily consisted of approximately million for our erp system and million for routine replacement of technology and other assets 
these expenditures were offset by write offs of property  plant and equipment totaling million in  including a charge of million to write off all costs related to the erp system due to our decision to discontinue this project 
we expect to continue to invest in capital equipment  customer evaluation systems and research and development equipment for applications development 
we estimate our total capital expenditures in to be approximately million  primarily for the development and introduction of new products and upgrades and incremental improvements to our erp systems 
accounts payable decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease resulted primarily from the timing of purchases and payments 
accrued payroll liabilities decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease resulted primarily from the absence of accrued bonuses at december  and the timing of payroll and benefit payments 
accrued warranty decreased million to million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease resulted from a decline in the number  as well as a shift in the mix of units under warranty 
additionally  we recorded a million adjustment to our warranty reserve due to favorable cost experience 
in addition to our million of convertible debt outstanding  we maintain million unsecured  committed and million unsecured  uncommitted bank borrowing facilities in the united states 
as part of our contracts with certain customers  we are required to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees which these customers can draw against in the event we do not perform in accordance with our contractual obligations 
at december   we had million of these guarantees and letters of credit outstanding  of which approximately million were secured by restricted cash deposits

recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies and estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the timing of revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuations of excess and obsolete inventory  valuation of investments in privately held companies  the lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets such as goodwill  existing technology intangibles and software development costs  restructuring and reorganization costs  accounting for income taxes  warranty liabilities  stock based compensation  and accounting for derivatives 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 
revenue recognition for products produced according to our published specifications  revenue is recognized when the title to the fei company and subsidiaries product and the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer 
for products produced according to a particular customer s specifications  revenue is recognized when the product meets the customer s specifications and when the title and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer 
in each case  the portion of revenue applicable to installation and customer acceptance is recognized upon meeting specifications at the installation site 
for new applications of our products where performance cannot be assured prior to meeting specifications at the installation site  no revenue is recognized until such specifications are met 
revenue  from time and materials based service arrangements  is recognized as the service is performed 
our billing terms on tems  sems  fibs and dualbeam systems generally include a holdback of to of the total purchase price subject to completion of installation and final acceptance at the customer site 
the portion of revenue related to installation and final acceptance  which is generally  is deferred until such installation and final acceptance are completed 
we recognize software license revenues in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  or sop  as amended by sop sop provides specific industry guidance and stipulates that revenue recognized from software arrangements is to be allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each element 
under sop  the determination of fair value is based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor 
we utilize the residual method under which revenue is allocated to the undelivered element  based on vendor specific evidence of fair value  and the residual amount of revenue is allocated to the delivered element 
we recognize license revenues upon delivery of the software 
we generally provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and provide maintenance and support services under renewable  term maintenance agreements 
maintenance and support fee revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term  which is generally twelve months  and commences from contract date 
deferred revenue represents customer deposits on equipment orders  orders awaiting customer acceptance and prepaid service contract revenue 
deferred revenue is recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies described above 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on collection experience and known trends with current customers 
the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies somewhat mitigates our credit risk exposure and the magnitude of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur based upon changes in revenue levels and associated balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in credit quality 
historically  we have not incurred significant write offs of accounts receivable  however  an individual loss could be significant due to the relative size of our sales transactions 
our bad debt expense totaled million   and million  respectively  in  and our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million at both december  and valuation of excess and obsolete inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined by standard cost methods  which approximate the first in  first out method 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis  based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology 
changes in support plans or technology could have a significant impact on obsolescence 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a substantial supply of parts for possible use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher percentage of reserve against the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it is ultimately to be used 
provision for inventory valuation ad justments totaled million  million and million  respectively  during  and provision for service inventory valuation adjustments totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and valuation of investments in privately held companies we made investments in several small  privately held technology companies in which we hold less than of the capital stock or hold notes receivable 
we account for these investments at their cost unless their value has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case  we write the investment down to its estimated fair value 
we review these investments periodically for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an other than temporary decline is evident  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment 
we evaluate the financial condition of the investee  market conditions and other factors providing an indication of the fair value of the investments 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the investees could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
during  we recorded i mpairments and losses on liquidation related to these investments totaling million 
as of december   we had million of investments in privately held companies recorded on our balance sheet 
lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets we evaluate the remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable fei company and subsidiaries part ii item management s discussion and analysis continued in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
for information on impairments recognized in  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
no such adjustments were made in or goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations  is evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual impairment test in november each year 
to perform that test  we compare the carrying value of our business segments to our estimates of the fair value of each of those segments 
if the fair value of a business segment is less than its carrying value  we will write down the related goodwill to its implied fair value 
we use estimates of future cash flows  discounted to present value  and other measures of fair value to estimate the relative fair value of each of our business segments 
it is reasonably possible that our estimates of future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions inherent in the calculation of the estimated fair value of each business s egment will change in the future  which could cause us to write down goodwill at that time 
we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in  or existing technology intangible assets existing technology intangible assets purchased in business combinations  which represent the estimated value of products utilizing technology existing as of the combination date discounted to their net present value  are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the technology 
we currently are using amortization periods ranging from to years for these assets 
changes in technology could affect our estimates of the useful lives of such assets 
we test our technology intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
we evaluate recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asse ts exceeds the fair value of the assets 
such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
we review the estimated useful lives of the assets on an annual basis 
during  we recorded impairment charges related to these assets totaling million  which were included as a component of asset impairment on our consolidated statement of operations 
for additional information on these impairments  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we did not change estimated useful lives or recognize impairment charges related to our technology intangible assets during or software development costs we capitalize certain software development costs for software expected to be sold independently or within our products 
such costs are capitalized after the technological feasibility of the project is determined and are reported on the balance sheet in other assets 
once we begin to include such software in our products  these costs are amortized over the estimated economic life of the software  which is usually years 
changes in technology could affect our estimate of the useful life of such assets 
we recorded impairment charges to software development costs totaling million in  which were included as a component of cost of sales on our consolidated statement of operations 
these impairment charges related primarily to our semiconductor businesses 
capitalized software development costs totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and for additional information on these impairment s  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and reorganization costs restructuring and reorganization costs are recognized and recorded at fair value as incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
restructuring and reorganization costs include severance and other costs related to employee terminations as well as facility costs related to future abandonment of various leased office and manufacturing sites 
changes in our estimates could occur  and have occurred  due to fluctuations in exchange rates  the sublease of unused space  unanticipated voluntary departures before severance was required and unanticipated redeployment of employees to vacant positions 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to more likely than not be realized in our future tax returns 
during  we recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets that existed prior to january  and united states deferred tax assets originated in should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our remaining net deferred tax assets in the future  additional increases to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required 
conversely  if we determine that certain tax assets that have been reserved for may be realized in the future  we may reduce our valuation allowance in future periods 
our net deferred tax fei company and subsidiaries assets totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and and our valuation allowance totaled million and million  respectively 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation  including potential interest and penalties on such exposures 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
significant income tax exposures include potential challenges of net operating loss carry back claims  research and experimentation credits  export related tax benefits  disposition transactions and intercompany pricing 
exposures are settled primarily through resolution of audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
warranty liabilities our products generally carry a one year warranty 
a reserve is established at the time of sale to cover estimated warranty costs and certain commitments for product upgrades 
our estimate of warranty cost is primarily based on our history of warranty repairs and maintenance  as applied to systems currently under warranty 
for our new products without a history of known warranty costs  we estimate the expected costs based on our experience with similar product lines and technology 
while most new products are extensions of existing technology  the estimate could change if new products require a significantly different level of repair and maintenance than similar products have required in the past 
our estimated warranty costs are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur as volume  product mix and warranty costs fluctuate 
our warranty reserve totaled million and million  respectively  at d ecember  and warranty expense totaled million  million and million  respectively  during  and the expense is net of a million positive adjustment to warranty expense based on an analysis of our actual warranty costs incurred compared to our reserve estimate 
stock based compensation beginning january   we will begin to account for stock options using sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  which requires companies to recognize in their statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
prior to january   we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we provided disclosures of net income and earnings per share as if the method prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
compensation expense  net of tax  calculated pursuant to sfas no 
totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and accounting for derivatives we use foreign forward extra contracts a combination of forward exchange and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions 
when specific criteria required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual tr ansactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels  or when the timing of transactions changes significantly  we reclassify a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense during the quarter in which such changes occur 
we also use foreign forward exchange contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exchange impact of our cash  receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
these derivatives do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in net income in the current period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk a large portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states through a number of foreign subsidiaries 
each of the foreign subsidiaries keeps its accounting records in its respective local currency 
these local currency denominated accounting records are translated at exchange rates that fluctuate up or down from period to period and consequently affect our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
the major foreign currencies in which we experience periodic fluctuations are the euro  the czech koruna  the japanese yen and the british pound sterling 
although for each of the last three years more than of our sales occurred outside of the united states  a large portion of these foreign sales were denominated in united states dollars and euros 
in addition  because of our substantial research  development and manufacturing operations in europe  we incur a greater proportion of our costs in europe than the revenue we derive from sales in that geographic region 
our raw materials  labor and other manufacturing costs are primarily denominated in united states dollars  euros fei company and subsidiaries part ii item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued and czech korunas 
this situation negatively affects our gross margins and results of operations when the dollar weakens in relation to the euro or koruna 
a strengthening of the dollar in relation to the euro or koruna would have a positive effect on our gross margins and results of operations 
movement of asian currencies in relation to the dollar and euro also can affect our reported sales and results of operations because we derive more revenue than we incur costs from the asia pacific region 
in addition  several of our competitors are based in japan and a weakening of the japanese yen has the effect of lowering their prices relative to ours 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate during the period 
the resulting translation adjustments decreased shareholders equity and comprehensive income in by million 
holding other variables constant  if the united states dollar weakened by against all currencies that we translate  shareholders equity would increase by approximately million as of december  holding other variables constant  if the united states dollar strengthened by against all currencies that we translate  shareholders equity would decrease by approximately million as of december  risk mitigation we use derivatives to mitigate financial exposure resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
when specific accounting criteria have been met  changes in fair values of derivative contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
changes in fair value for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in net income in the current period 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding derivative contracts was million  which contracts have varying maturities through december we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
holding other variables constant  if the united states dollar weakened by  the market value of our foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  would increase by approximately million 
the increase in value relating to the forward sale or purchase contracts would  however  be substantially offset by the revaluation of the transactions being hedged 
a increase in the united states dollar relative to the hedged currencies would have a similar  but negative  effect on the value of our foreign currency contracts  substantially offset again by the revaluation of the transactions being hedged 
balance sheet related we attempt to mitigate our currency exposures for recorded transactions by using forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our future cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies to hedge specific cash  receivables or payables positions denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in fair value of derivatives entered into to mitigate the foreign exchange risks related to these balance sheet items are recorded in other income expense currently together with the transaction gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position 
the hedging transactions we undertake limit our exposure to changes in the dollar euro exchange rate 
foreign currency losses recorded in other income expense  inclusive of the impact of derivatives  totaled million  million and million  respectively  in  and cash flow hedges we use foreign forward extra contracts a combination of forward exchange and option contracts and also option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions 
the foreign exchange hedging structure is set up generally on a twelve month time horizon 
the hedging transactions we undertake primarily limit our exposure to changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
the forward extra contract hedges are designed to protect us as the united states dollar weakens  but also provide us with some flexibility if the dollar strengthens 
beginning in the second quarter of  these derivatives met the criteria to be designated as hedges and  since then  we have recorded the change in fair value of these hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
we recognized realized losses of million in in cost of sales related to hedge results  compared to a realized gain of million in as of december   million of deferred unrealized net losses on outstanding derivatives have been recorded in other comprehensive income and are expected to be reclassified to net income during the next twelve months as a result of the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in net income 
in  we recorded charges totaling million in other income expense related to hedge dedesignations and ineffectiveness 
we continual ly monitor our hedge positions and forecasted transactions and  in the event changes to our forecast occur  we may have dedesignations of our cash flow hedges in the future 
prior to the second quarter of  we did not meet the criteria to treat these derivatives as hedges and  accordingly  the changes in fair value were recorded in net income 
we recorded unrealized losses of million and realized gains of million related to these contracts in as a component of other income 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relate to our investments 
since we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding at december   our interest expense is relatively fixed and not affected by changes in interest rates 
in the event we issue fei company and subsidiaries any new debt in the future  increases in interest rates will increase the interest expense associated with the debt 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this objective is accomplished by making diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million and short term restricted cash of million that consist of cash and highly liquid short term investments having maturity dates of no more than days at the date of acquisition 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
a decrease in interest rates of one percentage point would cause a corresponding decrease in annual interest income by approximately million assuming our cash and cash equivalent balances at december  remained constant 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  an increase in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
fixed rate debt securities as of december   we held short and long term fixed rate investments of million that consisted of corporate notes and bonds and government backed securities 
these investments are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains losses resulting from changes in the fair value are recorded  net of tax  in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of these investments  however  given our ability to hold these investments until maturity or until the unrealized losses recover  we do not expect these fluctuations to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term investments  as our short term portfolio is re invested at current market interest rates 
a decrease in interes t rates of one percentage point would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income from these items of approximately million assuming our investment balances at december  remained constant 
variable rate notes as of december   we held variable rate notes of million 
given the highly liquid nature of variable rate notes  cost is considered to approximate fair value for these securities and their fair value is not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations 
declines in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our investments in variable rate notes  as interest rates are reset periodically to current market interest rates 
a decrease in interest rates of one percentage point would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income from these items of less than million assuming our investment balances at december  remained constant 
fair value of convertible debt the fair market value of our fixed rate convertible debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value of our long term debt  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
at december   we had million of fixed rate convertible debt outstanding 
based on open market trades  we have determined that the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december  fei company and subsidiaries part ii
