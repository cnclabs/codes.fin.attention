for years prior to  revenues were presented to management in the intellectual property and services categories  however expenses were not allocated or presented to our management for these categories 
it would be impractical to determine an allocation method for prior year expenses  therefore only revenues will be presented for these new segments 
in addition to our reportable segments  we also have a corporate overhead category that is not a reportable segment 
this category includes certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to our business segments because these operating expenses and credits are not considered in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments

original equipment manufacturers utstarcom  inc denotes a tcc sublicense most semiconductor material suppliers are licensed under our tessera compliant mounting tape tcmt license  which requires these licensees to pay us a license fee  but not royalties 
sales and marketing our sales activities focus primarily on developing strong  direct relationships at the technical  marketing and executive management levels with leading companies in the semiconductor industry to license our technologies and sell our services 
we also sell our engineering services to system manufacturers and government agencies and their contractors 
marketing activities include identifying and promoting application based technologies for specific  vertical market needs  such as wireless communications  consumer or computing needs  and identifying major business opportunities for current and future product development 
product marketing focuses on identifying the needs and product requirements of our customers 
product marketing also manages the development of all of our technology throughout the development cycle and creates the required marketing materials to assist with the adoption of the technology 
marketing communications focuses on advertising and communications that promote the adoption of our technology 
research and development we believe that our success depends in part on our ability to achieve the following in a cost effective and timely manner develop new technologies that meet the changing needs of our customers and their markets  improve our existing technologies to enable growth into new application areas  and expand our intellectual property portfolio 
our research and development employees work closely with our sales and marketing employees  as well as our customers and partners  to bring new products incorporating our technology to market in a timely  high quality and cost 
table of contents efficient manner 
we also work closely with material and equipment infrastructure providers to identify new technologies and improve existing technologies for use in the assembly and manufacture of semiconductor packages that incorporate our technology 
research  development and other related costs were million in  million in and million in our service contracts involve research and development for commercial entities and government agencies 
for example  some of our development activities for the z fold over stack package technology were partially funded through service contracts with one of our semiconductor company licensees 
we also have collaborated with utstarcom on the development of a mobilecard technology  which is an ultra miniaturized mobile phone module that is equivalent to the size of two subscriber identity module  or sim cards 
our z multi chip packaging technologies and system level integration expertise were instrumental in the development of this highly innovative module 
our government contracts include terms required by the government that are not customary in commercial contracts  including a right of the government to terminate the contract at any time for convenience of the government 
see item a below risk factors for a description of other risks involving government contracts 
our research and development efforts currently focus on three major areas chip scale packaging 
our csp efforts focus on developing specific technologies for incorporation of existing or new csp technology into new applications  developing prototypes and supporting customers or infrastructure providers with improvements to products for existing applications 
we are developing next generation chip scale packages that could offer higher off chip wiring density and better signal performance 
multi chip packaging 
our multi chip packaging efforts focus on working with customers to incorporate our technology into their products and applications  developing prototypes and developing new  custom technologies to meet the needs of future applications 
wafer level packaging 
our wlp efforts focus on developing specific technologies for packaging of image sensors and other devices at the wafer level  developing prototypes and supporting customers with improvements to designs and process technologies 
we have additional research and development efforts underway in a number of areas related to the miniaturization of electronic products  including areas relating to materials  equipment  packaging  interconnect  assembly and testing of semiconductors and three dimensional modules 
intellectual property our future success and competitive advantage depend upon our continued ability to develop and protect our intellectual property 
to protect our intellectual property  we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets and trademarks 
we also attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with licensees  customers and potential customers and partners  and through proprietary information agreements with employees and consultants 
our patents address advanced single and multi chip and wafer level packaging  related processes  and complementary technologies 
we have made and continue to make considerable investments in expanding and defending our patent portfolio 
see item below legal proceedings for a description of material legal proceedings in which we have recently been involved 
as of december   our intellectual property portfolio included issued us patents and issued international patents 
in  additional us standard or provisional patent applications were filed  along with additional international patent applications 
our patents have expiration dates ranging from january  to january  we continually file new patent applications for new developments in our technology 

table of contents there are many countries in which we currently have no issued patents  however  products incorporating our technology that are sold in jurisdictions where patents have issued must be licensed  or stem from a licensed source  in order to avoid infringing our intellectual property 
competition as a developer and licensor of semiconductor packaging technology  we compete with other technologies  as opposed to other companies selling products 
these competing technologies come principally from the internal design groups of a number of semiconductor and package assembly companies 
many of these companies are licensees  or potential licensees  of ours 
in fact  many of our licensees consider packaging research and development to be one of their core competencies 
semiconductor companies that have their own package design and manufacturing capabilities include  but are not limited to  texas instruments inc  intel corporation and the semiconductor divisions of sharp corporation and samsung electronics co  ltd 
among the advanced packaging technologies developed by such companies are flip chip and chip on board technologies that compete with our csp  multi chip and wlp technologies 
our technologies also compete with technologies developed by the internal design groups of package assembly companies  such as advanced semiconductor engineering  inc  amkor technology  inc and stats chippac  inc 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the selection of semiconductor package technology by potential customers are proven technology  cost  size and circuit board area  performance  reliability  and available infrastructure 
we believe that our csp  multi chip and wlp technologies compete favorably in each of these factors with other advanced packaging technology solutions 
employees as of march   we had employees  with in sales  marketing and licensing  in research and development including employees who perform engineering  assembly and infrastructure services under our service agreements with third parties and in finance and administration 
we have never had a work stoppage among our employees and no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements other than certain ordinary course agreements of an employers collective which may bind our israeli subsidiary under israel law 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

risk factors a court invalidation or limitation of our key patents could significantly harm our business 
our patent portfolio contains some patents that are particularly significant to our ongoing revenues and business 
if any of these key patents are invalidated  or if a court limits the scope of the claims in any of these key patents  the likelihood that companies will take new licenses and that current licensees will continue to agree to pay under their existing licenses could be significantly reduced 
the resulting loss in license fees and royalties could significantly harm our business 
we are currently in litigation involving some of our key patents 
on march   the company filed a lawsuit against micron technology  inc and its subsidiary micron semiconductor products  inc 
collectively micron and against infineon technologies ag  infineon technologies richmond lp and infineon technologies north america corp 
collectively infineon in the us district court for the eastern district of texas  alleging infringement of the company s us patents     and  arising from micron s and infineon s respective manufacture  use  sale  offer to sell and or importation of certain packaged semiconductor components and assemblies thereof 
we seek to recover damages  up to treble the amount of actual damages  together with attorney s fees  interest and costs 
we also seek other relief  including enjoining micron and infineon from continuing to infringe these patents and other relief 
on april   the company filed an amended complaint against micron and infineon alleging their violation of federal antitrust law  texas antitrust law and texas common law based on micron s and infineon s anticompetitive actions in markets related to synchronous dram 
these new claims are in addition to the patent infringement claims in our original complaint  and we are seeking to recover additional damages for these new claims  including enhanced damages and or punitive damages  depending upon the nature of the claim 
we also seek other relief  including enjoining micron and infineon from continuing their anticompetitive actions 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
discovery has started  and trial is currently scheduled for august  an adverse decision in this proceeding could significantly harm our business 
on october   the company filed a complaint for patent infringement against advanced micro devices  inc amd and spansion llc spansion in the united states district court for the northern district of california  alleging infringement of the company s us patents    and  arising from amd s and spansion s respective manufacture  use  sale  offer to sell and or importation of certain packaged semiconductor components and assemblies thereof

this proceeding has just begun  and the company cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding 
discovery has just begun 
an adverse decision in this proceeding could significantly harm our business 
on march   the company issued a request for arbitration with amkor technology  inc amkor  regarding amkor s failure to pay royalties under its license agreement with tessera 
this proceeding has just begun  and the company cannot predict its outcome 
an adverse decision in this proceeding could significantly harm our business 
we have become and may in the future be involved in litigation with our licensees  potential licensees or strategic partners  which could harm our business 
our current lawsuit with infineon and micron potential licensees  as described below in part i  item legal proceedings  is an example 
any such dispute could cause the licensee or strategic partner to cease making 
table of contents royalty or other payments to us and could substantially damage our relationship with the company on both business and technical levels 
any litigation stemming from such a dispute could be very expensive and may cause us to cease being profitable 
litigation could also severely disrupt or shut down the business operations of our licensees or strategic partners  which in turn would significantly harm our ongoing relations with them and cause us to lose royalty revenues 
any such litigation could also harm our relationships with other licensees or our ability to gain new customers  who may postpone licensing decisions pending the outcome of the litigation 
in addition  many semiconductor and package assembly companies maintain their own internal design groups and have their own package design and manufacturing capabilities 
if we believe these groups have designed technologies that infringe upon our intellectual property  and if they fail to enter into a license agreement with us or pay for licensed technology  then we may be forced to commence legal proceedings against them 
if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our business will suffer 
we rely primarily on a combination of license  development and nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our licensees and others may seek to use our technology without the payment of license fees and royalties  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation 
the growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to convince third parties of the applicability of our intellectual property to their products  and our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights against them 
in certain instances  we attempt to obtain patent protection for portions of our intellectual property  and our license agreements typically include both issued patents and pending patent applications 
if we fail to obtain patents or if the patents issued to us do not cover all of the claims included in our patent applications  others could use portions of our intellectual property without the payment of license fees and royalties 
we also rely on trade secret laws rather than patent laws to protect other portions of our proprietary technology 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and customers 
we cannot be certain that these contracts have not been and will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
if we fail to use these mechanisms to protect our intellectual property  or if a court fails to enforce our intellectual property rights  our business will suffer 
we cannot be certain that these protection mechanisms can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated or challenged 
we may not be able to protect our confidential information  and this could adversely affect our business 
we generally enter into contractual relationships with our employees that protect our confidential information 
the misappropriation of our trade secrets or other proprietary information could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we may not be able to timely detect unauthorized use or transfer of our intellectual property and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights 
in the event we are unable to enforce these contractual obligations and our intellectual property rights  our business could be adversely affected 
we may be required to continue to undertake costly legal proceedings to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights and this may harm our business 
in the past we have found it necessary to litigate to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
we currently are involved in litigation regarding our intellectual property rights  as described below in part i  item legal proceedings  and we expect to be involved in similar litigation in the future 
litigation is inherently uncertain and any adverse decision could result in a loss of our 
table of contents proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from others  limit the value of our licensed technology or otherwise negatively impact our business 
whether or not determined in our favor or settled by us  litigation is costly and diverts our managerial  technical  legal and financial resources from our business operations 
our revenues may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce our intellectual property rights or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 
we rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries  and agreements with our employees  customers  suppliers and other parties  to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in our technology 
however  any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
further  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our technology adequately against unauthorized third party use  which could adversely affect our business 
third parties also may claim that we or our customers are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
even if we believe that the claims are without merit  the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards 
even if we have an agreement that provides for a third party to indemnify us against such costs  the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations to us 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms  or substitute similar technology from another source  our business could suffer 
if congress changes the patent laws  we could be adversely impacted tessera relies on the uniform and historically consistent application of united states patent laws and regulations 
congress is currently considering modifying the us patent laws  and the patent and trademark office is considering modifying certain regulations relating to filing for patent protection 
some of these modifications may not be advantageous for us  and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce our patents against parties using them without a license or a payment of royalties 
these changes could have a deleterious affect on our licensing program and  therefore  the royalties we receive 
a significant amount of our royalty revenues comes from a few market segments and products  and our business could be harmed if these market segments or products decline 
a significant portion of our royalty revenues comes from the manufacture and sale of packaged semiconductor chips for dsp  assp  asic and memory 
in addition  we derive substantial revenues from the incorporation of our technology into mobile phones 
if demand for semiconductors in any one or a combination of these market segments or products declines  our royalty revenues may be reduced and our business could be harmed 
moreover  were such a decline to occur  our business could become more cyclical in nature 
our revenue is concentrated in a few customers and if we lose any of these customers our revenues may decrease substantially 
we receive a significant amount of our revenues from a limited number of customers 
for the year ended december  revenues from samsung electronics co  ltd 
accounted for of total revenues and texas instruments  inc  accounted for of total revenues 
in the year ended december  revenues from intel corporation accounted for of total revenues and texas instruments  inc  accounted for of total revenues 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to come from a few customers for the foreseeable future 
if we lose any of these customers or if our revenues from them decline  our revenues may decrease substantially 

table of contents future changes in financial accounting standards or practices or existing taxation rules or practices may cause adverse unexpected revenue and expense fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices or a change in existing taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new accounting pronouncements and taxation rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements and taxation practice have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
for example  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments sbp  fasb statement no 
r revised  share based payment fas r  which will require us  starting january   to measure compensation costs for all stock based compensation including stock options at fair value and to recognize these costs as expenses in our statements of operations the recognition of these expenses in our statements of operations could have a negative affect on our earnings per share  which could negatively impact our future stock price 
we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts  and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 
we have agreements relating to services provided to government entities and  as a result  we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government 
the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts 
for example  many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts 
we are also subject to audits relating to compliance with the regulations governing government contracts 
a failure to comply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts  debarment from future government contracts  or civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  the government may acquire certain intellectual property rights in data produced or delivered under such contracts and inventions made under such contracts 
our financial and operating results may vary which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we currently provide guidance on revenue  expenses and cash taxes on a quarterly and annual basis 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
because our operating results are difficult to predict  you should not rely on quarterly or annual comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
we have had positive net income since the fourth quarter of factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate during any period include those listed in this risk factors section of this report and the following the timing and compliance with license or service agreement and the terms and conditions for payment to us of license or service fees under these agreements  changes in our royalties caused by changes in demand for products incorporating semiconductors that use our licensed technology  the amount of our service revenues  changes in the level of our operating expenses  delays in our introduction of new technologies or market acceptance of these new technologies through new license agreements  our failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  legal proceedings affecting our patents or patent applications  the timing of the introduction by others of competing technologies  
table of contents changes in demand for semiconductor chips in the specific markets in which we concentrate dsp  asic  assp semiconductors and memory  changes in accounting principles or a requirement to treat stock option grants as an operating expense  and cyclical fluctuations in semiconductor markets generally 
it is difficult to predict when we will enter into license agreements 
the time it takes to establish a new licensing arrangement can be lengthy 
delays or deferrals in the execution of license agreements may also increase as we develop new technologies 
because we generally recognize a significant portion of license fee revenues in the quarter that the license is signed  the timing of signing license agreements may significantly impact our quarterly or annual operating results 
under our typical license agreements  we also receive ongoing royalty payments  and these may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on manufacture or sales of products incorporating our licensed technology 
we expect to expand our business rapidly which will require us to increase our operating expenses 
we may not be able to increase revenues in an amount sufficient to offset these increased expenditures  which may lead to a loss for a quarterly period 
due to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and other factors  the price at which our common stock will trade is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
in future periods  if our revenues or operating results are below our estimates or the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors  our stock price could decline 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following a decline in the market price of their securities 
technology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility than companies in many other industries in recent years and  as a result  have  on average  been subject to a greater number of securities class action claims 
if our stock price is volatile  we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business 
network outages could disrupt our internal operations  which could adversely affect our revenues  customers and stock price 
despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unscheduled interruptions to the company through implementation of business continuity plans  our company may still be exposed to interruptions due to natural disasters  terrorism or acts of war which are beyond our control 
disruptions to these systems could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to provide services and support to our customers and fulfill contractual obligations 
as a result  our results of our operations  financial position  cash flows and stock price could be adversely affected 
we recently conducted our yearly evaluation of our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal controls  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  but we cannot ensure that these practices will satisfy future audits 
we have performed the system and process evaluation and testing required for compliance with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements of section while we have implemented the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion  we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our future evaluations or as to the results of the evaluations 
additionally  there are no assurances that we will be able to continue to comply with the requirements relating to internal controls and all other aspects of section in a timely fashion 
we have a royalty based business model  which is inherently risky 
our long term success depends on future royalties paid to us by licensees 
royalty payments under our tcc licenses are primarily based upon the number of electrical connections to the semiconductor chip in a package 
table of contents covered by our licensed technology  although we do have royalty arrangements in which royalties are paid based upon a percent of the net sales price or in which royalties are paid on a per package basis 
we are dependent upon our ability to structure  negotiate and enforce agreements for the determination and payment of royalties 
we face risks inherent in a royalty based business model  many of which are outside of our control  such as the following the rate of adoption and incorporation of our technology by semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers  the extent to which large equipment vendors and materials providers develop and supply tools and materials to enable manufacturing using our packaging technology  the demand for products incorporating semiconductors that use our licensed technology  and the cyclicality of supply and demand for products using our licensed technology 
it is difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our licensing agreements  and this may cause us to lose revenues 
the standard terms of our license agreements require our licensees to document the manufacture and sale of products that incorporate our technology and report this data to us on a quarterly basis 
although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information  audits can be expensive  time consuming  flawed and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationship with our licensees 
our license compliance program randomly audits licensees to independently verify the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the royalty revenues to which we are entitled to under the terms of our license agreements  but we cannot give assurances that the random audits will be effective to that end 
failure by our licensees to introduce products using our technology could limit our royalty revenues growth 
because we expect a significant portion of our future revenues to be derived from royalties on semiconductors that use our licensed technology  our future success depends upon our licensees developing and introducing commercially successful products 
any of the following factors could limit our licensees ability to introduce products that incorporate our technology the willingness and ability of materials and equipment suppliers to produce materials and equipment that support our licensed technology  in a quantity sufficient to enable volume manufacturing  the ability of our licensees to purchase such materials and equipment on a cost effective and timely basis  the willingness of our licensees and others to make investments in the manufacturing process that supports our licensed technology  and the amount and timing of those investments  and our licensees ability to design and assemble packages incorporating our technology that are acceptable to their customers 
failure by the semiconductor industry to adopt new high performance dram chips that utilize our packaging technology would significantly harm our business 
to date  our packaging technology has been used by several companies for high performance dram  chips 
for example  packaging using our technology was designated by rambus as the recommended package for its high performance rambus dram chips 
however  the dram designed by rambus has not been widely adopted due to the use of competing technologies such as the first generation of double data rate ddr dram  which does not widely utilize advanced packaging technologies 
dram manufacturers are also currently developing new high performance dram chips such as the next generation of ddr  referred to as 
table of contents ddr and ddr  to meet increasing speed and performance requirements of electronic products 
we believe that these new high performance dram chips will require advanced packaging technologies such as csp  and we currently have licensees  including samsung  electronics  co  ltd 
who are paying royalties for dram chips in advanced packages 
we anticipate that royalties from shipments of these new  high performance dram chips packaged using our technology may account for a significant percentage of our future revenues 
if semiconductor manufacturers do not adopt new  high performance dram as quickly as is currently being projected by industry sources or find an alternate viable packaging technology for use with their high performance dram chips  or if we do not receive royalties from new  high performance dram chips that use our technology  our future revenues could be adversely affected 
our technology may be too expensive for certain new  high performance dram manufacturers  which could significantly reduce the adoption rate of our packaging technology in new  high performance dram chips 
even if our package technology is selected for at least some of these new  high performance dram chips  there could be delays in the introduction of products utilizing these chips that could materially affect the amount and timing of any royalty payments that we receive 
other factors that could affect adoption of our technology for new  high performance dram products include delays or shortages of materials and equipment and the availability of testing services 
failure by the semiconductor industry to adopt broadly wlp packaging technology could limit our royalty revenue growth 
to date  wafer level packaging technologies have been adopted for a limited number of semiconductor products 
to date  our packaging technology has been used by several companies for cmos image sensor chips principally for use in camera equipped mobile phones 
we believe that such wlp packages will be useful for image sensors in other applications such as personal digital assistants and digital cameras  and for other applications such as mems devices 
we anticipate that royalties from shipments of chips packaged using our wlp technology may account for a small but increasing percentage of our future revenues 
if semiconductor manufacturers do not adopt our wlp technology as quickly as is currently being projected by industry sources or find an alternate viable packaging technology for use with their image sensor and mems chips  or if we do not receive royalties from image sensor and mems chips that use our technology  our future revenues could be adversely affected 
our technology may be too expensive for certain image sensor manufacturers  which could significantly reduce the adoption rate of our wlp packaging technology in image sensor applications 
other factors that could affect adoption of our wlp technology for image sensors and mems chips include delays or shortages of materials and equipment 
competing technologies may harm our business 
we expect that our technologies will continue to compete with technologies of internal design groups of semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers 
these internal design groups create their own packaging solutions  and have direct access to their company s technical information and technology roadmaps  and have capacity  cost and technical advantages over us 
if these internal design groups design around our patents  they may not need to license our technology 
these groups may design package technology that is less expensive to implement than ours or provides products with higher performance or additional features 
many of these groups have substantially greater resources  financial or otherwise  than us and lower cost structures 
as a result  they may be able to get their package technology adopted more easily and quickly 
for instance  certain flip chip technologies are being used by large semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers for a variety of semiconductors  including processors and memory 
another example of a competitive technology is the small format lead frame packages 
table of contents that are also gaining popularity 
the companies using these technologies are utilizing their current lead frame infrastructure to achieve cost effective results 
another example of a competitive technology is the chip on board technique to package image sensors 
in the future  our licensed technologies may also compete with other package technologies 
these technologies may be less expensive than ours and provide higher or additional performance 
companies with these competing technologies may also have greater resources than us 
technological change could render our technologies obsolete  and new  competitive technologies could emerge that achieve broad adoption and adversely affect the use of our intellectual property 
if we do not create and implement new designs to expand our licensable technology portfolio  our competitive position could be harmed and our operating results adversely affected 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from licenses and royalties from a relatively small number of key technologies 
we plan to devote significant engineering resources in order to develop new packaging technologies to address the evolving needs of the semiconductor and the consumer and communication electronics industries 
to remain competitive  we must introduce new technologies or designs in a timely manner and the market must adopt them 
developments in packaging technologies are inherently complex  and require long development cycles and a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability 
we may not be able to develop and market new technologies in a timely or commercially acceptable fashion 
moreover  our currently issued us patents expire at various times from january  through january  we need to develop and patent successful innovations before our current patents expire 
we also attempt to expand our licensable technology portfolio and technical expertise by acquiring technology or developing strategic relationships with others 
these strategic relationships may include the right for us to sublicense technology to others 
however  we may not be able to acquire or obtain rights to licensable technology in a timely manner or upon commercially reasonable terms 
moreover  our research and development efforts  and acquisitions and strategic relationships  may be futile if we do not accurately predict the future packaging needs of the semiconductor  consumer and communication electronics industries 
our failure to develop or acquire new technologies could significantly harm our business 
some of our license agreements have fixed terms and  in order to maintain our relationships with licensees under such agreements  we will need to renegotiate some of our existing license agreements in the future 
some of our license agreements have fixed terms 
we will need to renegotiate license agreements with fixed terms prior to the expiration of such license agreements and  based on various factors including the technology and business needs of our licensees  we may not be able to renegotiate such license agreements on similar terms  or at all 
in order to maintain existing relationships with some of our licensees  we may be forced to renegotiate license agreements on terms that are more favorable to such licensees  which could harm our results of operations 
if we fail to renegotiate our license agreements we would lose existing licensees and our business would be materially adversely affected 
our licensing cycle is lengthy and costly and our marketing and sales efforts may be unsuccessful 
we generally incur significant marketing and sales expenses prior to entering into our license agreements  generating a license fee and establishing a royalty stream from each licensee 
the length of time it takes to establish a new licensing relationship can range from six to months or longer 
as such  we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenues stream begins 
we employ intensive marketing and sales efforts to educate materials suppliers  equipment vendors  licensees  potential licensees and original equipment manufacturers about the benefits of our technologies 
in addition  even if these companies adopt our technologies  they must devote significant resources to integrate fully 
table of contents our technologies into their operations 
if our marketing and sales efforts are unsuccessful  then we will not be able to achieve widespread acceptance of our packaging technology 
cyclicality in the semiconductor industry may affect our revenues  and as a result  our operating results could be adversely affected 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical and is characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  this industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product and technology cycles  excess inventories and declines in general economic conditions 
this cyclicality could cause our operating results to decline dramatically from one period to the next 
our business depends heavily upon the volume of production by our licensees  which  in turn  depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products that use semiconductors 
similarly  our services business relies at least in part upon the outsourcing of design and engineering projects by the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor manufacturers and package assembly companies generally sharply curtail their spending during industry downturns and historically have lowered their spending more than the decline in their revenues 
as a result  if we are unable to control our expenses adequately in response to lower revenues from our licensees and service customers  our operating results will suffer and we might experience operating losses 
the international nature of our business exposes us to financial and regulatory risks and we may have difficulty protecting our intellectual property in some foreign countries 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from licensees headquartered outside of the united states  principally in asia 
for year ended december  these revenues accounted for of our total revenues 
for the year ended december  these revenues accounted for of total revenues 
international operations are subject to a number of risks  including the following international terrorism and anti american sentiment  particularly in the emerging markets  laws and business practices favoring local companies  withholding tax obligations on license revenues that we may not be able to offset fully against our us tax obligations  including the further risk that foreign tax authorities may re characterize license fees or increase tax rates  which could result in increased tax withholdings and penalties  and less effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the united states or other developed countries 
our intellectual property is also used in a large number of foreign countries 
there are many countries  such as china  in which we currently have no issued patents 
in addition  effective intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
it may be difficult for us to protect our intellectual property from misuse or infringement by other companies in these countries 
we expect this to become a greater problem for us as our licensees increase their manufacturing in countries which provide less protection for intellectual property 
our inability to enforce our intellectual property rights in some countries may harm our business 
our services business may subject us to specific costs and risks that we may fail to manage adequately which could harm our business 
we derive a portion of our revenues from engineering services 
among the engineering services that we offer are customized package design and prototyping  modeling  simulation  failure analysis and reliability testing and related training services 
a number of factors  including  among others  the perceived value of our intellectual property portfolio  our ability to convince customers of the value of our engineering services and our reputation for performance under our service contracts  could cause our revenues from engineering services to decline  which would in turn harm our operating results 

table of contents moreover  most of our service revenues are derived from engineering services we provide to government agencies and their contractors to enable the development of new packaging technologies 
if demand for our services from government agencies declines  due to changes in government policies or otherwise  our service revenues will be adversely affected 
under our services contracts we are required to perform certain services  including sometimes delivering designs and prototypes 
if we fail to deliver as required under our service contracts  we could lose revenues and become subject to liability for breach of contract 
we provide certain services at below cost in an effort to increase the speed and breadth with which the semiconductor industry adopts our technologies 
for example  we provide modeling  manufacturing process training  equipment and materials characterization and other services to assist licensees in designing  implementing  upgrading and maintaining their packaging assembly line 
we frequently provide these services as a form of training to introduce new licensees to our technology and existing clients to new technologies  with the aim that these services will help us to generate revenues in the future 
we need to monitor these services adequately in order to ensure that we do not incur significant expenses without generating corresponding revenues 
our failure to monitor these services or our design and prototype services adequately may harm our operating results 
because our services sometimes involve the delivery of package designs and prototypes  we may be subject to claims that we infringed or induced the infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights belonging to others 
if such a claim were made  we may have to take a license or stop manufacturing the accused packages  which could cause our services revenues to decrease 
if we choose not to take a license  we may be sued for infringement  and may incur significant litigation costs in defending against the lawsuit 
if we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we may have to pay damages and could be subject to an injunction preventing us from continuing to provide the services 
any of these outcomes could harm our business 
if our prototypes  manufactured packages or products based on our designs are used in defective products  we may be subject to product liability or other claims 
under our service contracts  we may  at times  manufacture packages on a limited basis  deliver prototypes or designs or help to design prototypes or products 
if these prototypes  packages or designs are used in defective or malfunctioning products  we could be sued for damages  especially if the defect or malfunction causes physical harm to people 
the occurrence of a problem could result in product liability claims and or a recall of  or safety alert or advisory notice relating to  the product 
while we believe the amount of product liability insurance maintained by us combined with the indemnities that we have been granted under these service contracts are adequate  there can be no assurance that these will be adequate to satisfy claims made against us in the future or that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
product liability claims or product recalls in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and reputation  and on our ability to attract and retain licensees and customers 
we intend to expand our operations which may strain our resources and increase our operating expenses 
we plan to expand our operations  domestically and internationally  and may do so through both internal growth and acquisitions 
we expect that this expansion will strain our systems and operational and financial controls 
in addition  we are likely to incur higher operating costs 
to manage our growth effectively  we must continue to improve and expand our systems and controls 
if we do fail to do so  our growth would be limited 
our officers have limited experience in managing large or rapidly growing businesses through acquisitions 
further  our officers have limited experience managing companies through acquisitions and technological changes 
in addition  our management has limited experience in managing a public company 

table of contents we have made and may continue to make acquisitions which could divert management s attention  cause ownership dilution to our stockholders  be difficult to integrate and adversely affect our financial results 
acquisitions are commonplace in the semiconductor industry and we may acquire businesses or technologies 
integrating newly acquired businesses or technologies could put a strain on our resources  could be costly and time consuming  and might not be successful 
such acquisitions could divert our management s attention from other business concerns 
in addition  we might lose key employees while integrating new organizations 
acquisitions could also result in customer dissatisfaction  performance problems with an acquired company or technology  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  the assumption or incurrence of contingent liabilities  possible impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangible assets or other unanticipated events or circumstances  any of which could harm our business 
consequently  we might not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses  products or technologies  and might not achieve anticipated revenues and cost benefits 
there are numerous risks with our recent acquisition of certain assets from shellcase  ltd 
in december  we completed our acquisition of certain equipment  intellectual property and other intangible assets from shellcase  ltd  a company based in israel 
this acquisition is subject to a number of risks  including the following the acquisition could fail to produce benefits that we anticipate  or could have other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
as a result  the acquisition could result in a reduction of net income per share as compared to the net income per share we would have achieved if the acquisition had not occurred 
following completion of the acquisition  we may subsequently uncover additional liabilities or unforeseen expenses not discovered during our diligence procedures 
these additional liabilities or expenses could result in significant additional unanticipated costs not originally estimated and may harm our financial results 
the integration of the shellcase ltd 
assets will be a time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our operations if it is not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
if this integration effort is not successful  our results of operations could be harmed  employee morale could decline  key employees could leave  and customer relations could be damaged 
in addition  we may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits 
we have incurred substantial direct transaction costs associated with this acquisition and anticipate incurring substantial additional costs to support the integration of the acquired assets 
the total cost of the integration may exceed our expectations 
if we lose any of our key personnel or are unable to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 
our success depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  legal and finance personnel  many of whom are highly skilled and would be difficult to replace 
in particular  the services of dr 
mcwilliams  our president  chief executive officer and the chairman of our board of directors  who has led our company since may and been chairman since february  are very important to our business 
none of our senior management  key technical personnel or key sales personnel are bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period 
in addition  we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our key personnel 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key personnel could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 
in addition  the initial stock options that were granted to many of our senior management and key employees are fully vested 
therefore  these employees may not have sufficient financial incentive to stay with 
table of contents us  we may have to incur costs to replace key employees that leave  and our ability to execute our business model could be impaired if we cannot replace departing employees in a timely manner 
many of our senior management personnel and other key employees have become  or will soon become  substantially vested in their initial stock options grants 
while we often grant additional stock options to management personnel and other key employees after their hire dates to provide additional incentives to remain employed by us  their initial grants are usually much larger than follow on grants 
employees may be more likely to leave us after their initial option grant fully vests  especially if the shares underlying the options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the option exercise price 
if any members of our senior management team leave the company  our ability to successfully operate our business could be impaired 
we also may have to incur significant costs in identifying  hiring  training and retaining replacements for departing employees 
our success also depends on our ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing  legal and finance personnel and on the abilities of new personnel to function effectively  both individually and as a group 
competition for qualified senior employees can be intense 
for example  we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled engineers with appropriate qualifications to support our growth and expansion 
further  we must train our new personnel  especially our technical support personnel  to respond to and support our licensees and customers 
if we fail to do this  it could lead to dissatisfaction among our licensees or customers  which could slow our growth or result in a loss of business 
decreased effectiveness of share based compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees 
we have historically used stock options and other forms of share based compensation as key components of our employee compensation program in order to align employees interests with the interests of our stockholders  encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement r  share based payment  we will begin recording charges to earnings for share based payments in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we will incur increased compensation costs associated with our share based compensation programs 
moreover  difficulties relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could make it harder or more expensive for us to grant share based payments to employees in the future 
as a result  we may find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business 
failure to comply with environmental regulations could harm our business 
we use hazardous substances in the manufacturing and testing of prototype products and in the development of our technologies in our research and development laboratories 
we are subject to a variety of local  state  federal and foreign governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances 
our past  present or future failure to comply with environmental regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines on us  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
compliance with such regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur other substantial expenses 
any failure by us to control the use  disposal  removal or storage of  or to adequately restrict the discharge of  or assist in the cleanup of  hazardous or toxic substances  could subject us to significant liabilities  including joint and several liability under certain statues 
the imposition of such liabilities could significantly harm our business 
our operations are primarily located in california and  as a result  are subject to catastrophes 
our business operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our facilities  computer systems and personnel  which are primarily located in or near our principal headquarters in san jose  california 
san jose exists on or near a known earthquake fault zone 
should an earthquake or other catastrophes  such as fires  
table of contents floods  power loss  communication failure or similar events disable our facilities  we do not have readily available alternative facilities from which we could conduct our business 
we have a research and development facility in jerusalem  israel that subjects us to risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our research and development facility in jerusalem  israel may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to design  develop  test or market certain technologies  which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including security concerns  including crime  political instability  terrorist activity  armed conflict and civil or military unrest  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions  differing employment practices and labor issues limited infrastructure and disruptions  such as large scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers  and natural disasters 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq national market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are often subject to varying interpretations 
as a result  their application in practice may evolve as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
as a result of our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  we have increased and will likely continue to increase general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place  we are still exposed to potential risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment has required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
in addition  director and officer liability insurance has become more expensive and we have purchased reduced coverage as compared to previous years 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
further  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which could harm our business

we enable improvements in miniaturization and performance by applying our expertise in the electrical  thermal and mechanical properties of materials and interconnect 
we develop and license technologies to the electronics industry 
our intellectual property includes more than issued patents  covering a broad range of advanced semiconductor packaging and interconnect solutions 
we license our technology to our customers  enabling them to produce semiconductor chips that are smaller and faster  and incorporate more features 
these semiconductors are utilized in a broad range of electronics products  including digital audio players  digital cameras  personal computers  personal digital assistants  video game consoles and mobile phones 
in addition  by using our technology  we believe that our customers are also able to reduce the time to market and development costs of their semiconductors 
from our inception in through  we engaged principally in research and development activities related to chip scale and multi chip packaging technology 
we began generating revenues from licenses of our intellectual property in we began manufacturing activities in to support market acceptance of our technology 
we discontinued most of these manufacturing activities in after many suppliers had developed the manufacturing infrastructure to implement our technology 
we continue to develop prototypes and manufacture limited volumes of select circuits 
we generate revenues from royalties and license fees  which represents the majority of our revenues and consists of royalties on semiconductors shipped by our licensees that employ these patented technologies  and license fees for our patented technologies and  services  which utilize or further our intellectual property and drive our product introduction process 
licensees pay a non refundable license fee 
revenues from license fees are generally recognized once the license agreement has been executed by both parties 
in some instances  we provide training to our licensees under the terms of the license agreement 
the amount of training provided is limited and is incidental to the licensed technology 
accordingly  in instances where training is provided under the terms of a license agreement  a portion of the license fee is deferred until the training has been provided 
the amount of revenues deferred is based on the price we charge for similar services when they are sold separately 
semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers pay on going royalties on their production or shipment of semiconductors incorporating our intellectual property 
royalty payments are primarily based upon the number of electrical connections to the semiconductor chip in a package covered by our technology  although we do have arrangements in which royalties are paid based upon a percent of the net sales price 
our licensees report royalties quarterly  and most also pay on a quarterly basis 
as there is no reliable basis on which to estimate our royalty revenues prior to obtaining these reports from our licensees  we recognize royalty revenues when we receive a royalty report from our customer 
we receive these reports the quarter after the semiconductors that incorporate our technology have been produced or shipped 

table of contents from time to time  we receive payments through license negotiations or through the resolution of patent disputes 
these license negotiations and dispute settlements generally include amounts for royalties related to previous periods based on historical production volumes 
these amounts are reported as past production payments revenues previously identified as other intellectual property revenues in the statement of operations 
in an effort to more specifically reflect the components of this revenue line  we changed the nomenclature as of the quarter ended june  past production payments revenues will vary significantly on a quarterly basis 
service revenues are primarily derived from engineering services  including related training services 
revenues from services related to training are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from other services are recognized on a percentage of completion or completed contract method of accounting depending on the nature of the project 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues recognized are that portion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated final total costs based on current estimates of the total costs to complete the projects 
if the total estimated costs to complete a project were to exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss would be recognized immediately 
revenues under the completed contract method are recognized upon acceptance by the customer or in accordance with the contract specifications 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from licensees headquartered outside of the united states  principally in asia  and these revenues accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended december  we expect that these revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of revenues in future periods 
all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars 
for the year ended december   samsung electronics co  ltd 
and texas instruments  inc each accounted for over of revenue 
for the year ended december   intel corporation and texas instruments  inc each account for over of total revenues 
we license most of our csp and multi chip packaging technology under a license that we refer to as a tcc license 
our tcc license grants a worldwide right under the licensed patent claims to assemble  use and sell certain csps and multi chip packages 
we generally license semiconductor material suppliers under our tcmt license 
our tcmt license calls for a one time license fee and  unlike most of our other licenses  does not require ongoing royalty payments 
effective  we organized our business operations into five operating groups  the advanced semiconductor packaging group  the emerging markets and technologies group  tessera interconnect materials  inc our wholly owned subsidiary formed in may  the wafer level technologies division and the product miniaturization division 
these groups are reported into two segments  intellectual property  which consists of our advanced semiconductor packaging group  emerging markets and technologies group  tessera interconnect materials  inc and our wafer level technologies division are consolidated  and services  which consists of our production miniaturization division 
the segments were determined based upon how our management views and evaluates our operations 
segment information in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report are presented in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
for years prior to  revenues were presented to management in the intellectual property and services categories  however  expenses were not allocated or presented to our management for these categories 
consequently  it would be impractical to determine an allocation method for prior year expenses  therefore only revenues will be presented for these new segments 
in addition to our reportable segments  we also have a corporate overhead category that is not a reportable segment 
this category includes certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to our business segments because these operating expenses and credits are not considered in evaluating the operating performance of our business segments 
beginning in management anticipates reorganizing its business units into three operating divisions the licensing business  the product division and emerging markets and technologies 
we anticipate that the 
table of contents product division will incorporate operational functions that will be reported in both our intellectual property and services segments 
cost of revenues consists primarily of direct compensation  materials  supplies and equipment depreciation costs 
cost of revenues primarily relates to service revenues as the cost of revenues associated with intellectual property revenues is de minimis 
consequently  cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues will vary based on the percentage of our revenues that is attributable to service revenues 
research  development and other related costs consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel as well as costs related to patent applications and examinations  materials  supplies and equipment depreciation 
our research and development is conducted primarily in house and targets csp  multi chip and wafer level technology 
all research  development and other related costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe that a significant level of research  development and other related costs will be required for us to remain competitive in the future 
we have increased research and development personnel to at december  from at december   and expect to continue to increase research and development personnel in the future 
selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  marketing programs  public relations  promotional materials  travel and related trade show expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for general management  information technology  finance and accounting personnel  litigation expenses and related fees  facilities costs  and professional services 
our general and administrative expenses are not allocated to other expense line items 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  related regulations and ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
excluding litigation expenses  we expect that as a percentage of revenues  these expenses will decrease over time 
however  we expect that litigation expenses will continue to be a material portion of our general and administrative expenses in future periods  and may increase significantly in some periods  because of our ongoing litigation  as described above in part i  item legal proceedings  and because we expect that we will become involved in other litigation from time to time in the future in order to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
in connection with the grant of stock options from through  we recorded an aggregate of million in deferred stock based compensation within stockholders equity  due to the difference between the exercise price and the estimated fair value of common stock on the date of grant

segment results effective  we organized our business operations into five operating groups  the advanced semiconductor packaging group  the emerging markets and technologies group  tessera interconnect materials  inc  the wafer level technologies division and the product miniaturization division 
these groups are reported into two segments  intellectual property and services 
our intellectual property segment is composed of the following advanced semiconductor packaging group 
our advanced semiconductor packaging group is focused on licensing technologies in our core markets  which include dram  flash  sram  dsp  asic  assp  micro controllers  general purpose logic and analog devices 
key functions of this group include development  marketing and r d 
this group works closely with idms  which make semiconductors that use our technology 
emerging markets and technologies group 
our emerging markets and technologies group is focused on expanding our technology portfolio into areas outside of our core markets that represent long term growth opportunities through application of existing patents  products and technologies  internal development of new technologies for high growth markets  applications such as imaging  mems and rf  and new partnerships  ventures and acquisitions of complementary technology 

table of contents tessera interconnect materials  inc tessera interconnect materials  inc

net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
all federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are related to stock option deductions 
the principal difference between the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards is attributable to the capitalization of research  development and other related costs for state purposes 
these operating loss carryforwards begin to expire on various dates beginning in  and will continue to expire through under the provisions of the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income

net cash provided by financing activities for year ended december  was million  which was comprised primarily of net proceeds of million from the company s initial public offering 
we believe that based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  our cash from operations  together with cash currently available  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses  unanticipated acquisitions of technologies or businesses or unanticipated strategic investments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect

contractual cash obligations payments due by period total years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab 
table of contents sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue at the time until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
royalty and license fees royalty and license fees revenues include revenues from license fees and from royalty payments 
licensees typically pay a non refundable license fee 
revenues from license fees are generally recognized at the time the license agreement is executed by both parties 
in some instances  we provide training to our licensees under the terms of the license agreement 
the amount of training provided is limited and is incidental to the licensed technology 
accordingly  in instances where training is provided under the terms of a license agreement  a portion of the license fee is deferred until such training has been provided 
the amount of revenues deferred is the estimated fair value of the services  which is based on the price we charge for similar engineering services when they are sold separately 
these revenues are reported as service revenues 
semiconductor manufacturers and assemblers pay on going royalties on their production or shipment of semiconductors incorporating our intellectual property 
royalties under our royalty based technology licenses are generally based upon either unit volumes of semiconductors produced or shipped using our technology or a percent of the net sales price 
licensees generally report production or shipment information to days after the end of the quarter in which such activity takes place 
as there is no reliable basis on which we can estimate royalty revenues prior to obtaining these reports from the licensees  we recognize royalty revenues on a one quarter lag 
in some cases  licensees pre pay a portion of future royalty obligations 
these amounts are deferred and recognized as future royalty obligations are reported by the licensee 
past production payments past production payments revenues are royalty payments received through license negotiations or the resolution of patent disputes 
such negotiations arise when it comes to our attention that a third party is infringing on patents or a current licensee is not paying royalties that we are entitled to 
past production payments revenues represent the portion of royalty payments received through such license negotiations or resolution of patent disputes that relates to previous periods and are based on historical production or shipment volumes 
revenues are recognized upon execution of the agreement by both parties  provided that the amounts are fixed or determinable  there are no significant obligations and collection is reasonably assured 
we do not recognize any revenues prior to execution of the agreement as there is no reliable basis on which we can estimate the amounts for royalties related to previous periods or assess collectibility 
service revenues we utilize the completed contract and the percentage of completion methods of accounting for both commercial and government contracts  dependent upon the type of the contract 
the completed contract method of accounting is used for fixed fee contracts with relatively short delivery times 
revenues from fixed fee contracts are recognized upon acceptance by the customer or in accordance to the contract specifications  assuming title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  prices are fixed and determinable  no significant obligations remain  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
we use the percentage of completion method of accounting for cost reimbursement type contracts  which generally specify the reimbursable costs and a certain billable fee amount 
under the percentage of completion method  revenues recognized are that portion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to 
table of contents date to the anticipated final total costs based on current estimates of the costs to complete the projects 
if the total estimated costs to complete a project were to exceed the total contract amount  indicating a loss  the entire anticipated loss would be recognized immediately 
revenues  including estimated earned fees  under cost reimbursement type contracts are recognized as costs are incurred  assuming that the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
claims made for amounts in excess of the agreed contract price are recognized only if it is probable that the claim will result in additional revenues and the amount of additional revenues can be reliably estimated 
estimating accrued liabilities 
we review our accounts payable and accrued liabilities at each reporting period  and accrue liabilities as appropriate 
during this analysis we consider items such as research and development activity  commitments made to or the level of activity with vendors  payroll and employee related costs  historic spending  budgeted spending and anticipated changes in the costs of services 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of assets useful lives and future cash flows 
when such an event occurs  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
to date  no impairment loss has been recognized 
we assess the impairment in value to our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following operating losses  significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  and significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 
goodwill the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions  annually at the beginning of its third quarter  or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test is a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with allocated goodwill to its net book value 
the company uses management estimates of future cash flows to perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins and operating expenses 
discounted cash flow and market multiple methodologies are used to obtain the fair value for each reporting unit 
the second step is only performed if impairment is indicated after the first step is performed  as it involves measuring the actual impairment to goodwill 
no goodwill impairment was recorded for the periods presented 
stock based compensation

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no

expense associated with stock based compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the individual award consistent with the method described in financial accounting standards board interpretation 
table of contents no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no

 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf 
under sfas and eitf  stock option awards issued to non employees are accounted for at fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
we believe that the fair value of the stock options are more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received 
the fair value of each non employee stock award is remeasured at each period end until a commitment date is reached  which is generally the vesting date 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the income tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts at enacted tax rates in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax liability or asset  respectively 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets of million which had a tax valuation allowance of million 
during  the deferred tax assets increased by approximately million to million 
the net deferred tax asset of million has been realized as a result of historic and current income  and prospects of future book income 
the remaining deferred tax asset of million relates to deferred tax assets from federal and state net operating losses and certain tax credits resulting from stock option deductions 
due to the uncertainty regarding the realization of these tax assets  the valuation allowance associated with these deferred tax assets is million 
when recognized  the tax benefit will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital 
litigation and contingencies 
from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business  as well as other matters identified above in part  item legal proceedings 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain  and any adverse decision could result in a loss of our proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from others  limit the value of our technologies and otherwise negatively impact over business 
if we believe that it is probable for a certain proceeding to result in an adverse decision and that the loss is estimable  we would establish an appropriate accrual for the loss

and sfas no 
 which changes the requirements for the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles were required to be recognized by way of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income during the period of the change

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
some of the securities that we may invest in the future may be subject to market risk for changes in interest rates 
to mitigate this risk  we plan to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  which may include commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
currently  we are exposed to minimal market risks 
we manage the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining a conservative portfolio  which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows
