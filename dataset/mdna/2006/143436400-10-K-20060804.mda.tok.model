item selected financial data 
the consolidated selected historical financial and other data below should be read in conjunction with item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the selected historical financial and other data for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended december  are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements 
see note of our notes to our audited annual consolidated financial statements with respect to our restatement of prior period amounts 
the restatement adjustments described in note have also been applied to the selected historical financial and other data for the years ended december  and  respectively 
however  because our consolidated financial statements for those years were audited by a predecessor independent registered public accounting firm  and the restatement adjustments have not been subjected to separate audits  the selected historical financial and other data for those two years are presented as unaudited 
during the period from august  through january   we operated as a debtor in possession under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
our results of operations during the reorganization period were significantly affected by the bankruptcy proceeding and are therefore not comparable in all respects with our results for other periods 
in addition  the per share data for all periods prior to reflect the shares of our previously outstanding classes of common stock  which were cancelled when our reorganization became effective 
the results from those periods are not comparable to the years ended december    and  which are based on a different number of shares of our new class of common stock issued when the reorganization became effective

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
restatements during the second quarter of  we determined that it was necessary to restate our previously issued financial statements for each of the years ended december  and  and each of the quarters ended march  june and september  to correct for errors in the financial statements related to our failure to properly account for certain lease related transactions and other matters 
the following errors in the application of generally accepted accounting principles to lease transactions have been corrected where separation of the ground lease and building lease elements of a theatre lease were required pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases sfas  we had utilized a pro rata method to fragment leases into building and land elements 
the land lease should have been determined by applying an appropriate incremental borrowing rate to the fair value of the land with the remaining lease payments being applied to the lease of the building 
for purposes of determining whether the lease is a capital lease because the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeds of the fair value of the leased property  we used an incorrect incremental borrowing rate 
similarly  to the extent the lease was determined to be a capital lease  the same incorrect rate was utilized to record the capital lease obligation 
for certain leases  we incorrectly utilized a period exceeding the term of the lease for purposes of amortizing leasehold improvements or capital lease assets 
adjustments were recorded to reflect the amounts computed using the correct lease term 

table of contents we did not properly re assess lease classification upon modification of the terms of certain leases 
accordingly  in some cases  the classification of the leases may have been incorrectly recorded in the financial statements and or amounts related to the capital leases were not correctly adjusted for such modification 
we did not correctly account for certain build to suit arrangements in which  for financial reporting purposes  we were considered the owner of these assets during the construction period 
upon completion of the construction projects  we determined that we were unable to meet the requirements for sale leaseback treatment  accordingly  project costs funded by the landlord should have been recorded as financing obligations 
we incorrectly capitalized interest on payments we made for construction of lessor owned assets under lease arrangements in which we were not considered the owner of the project for financial reporting purposes 
additionally  for one build to suit construction project  we utilized an incorrect interest rate for purposes of capitalizing interest  and incorrectly capitalized interest over periods in which construction activity had been deferred for reasons other than normal construction delays 
we included contingent payments under lease arrangements classified as capital leases or financing obligations as rent expense  rather than interest expense 
we did not revise deferred rental liability calculations to reflect modifications of the terms of certain operating leases 
we incorrectly reported the cost of our contribution to lessor assets through the funding of project costs as leasehold improvements  rather than as building costs  assets under capital lease or prepaid rent  as appropriate under each arrangement 
in addition  we did not ensure the completeness and accuracy of supporting schedules and underlying data for routine journal entries and journal entries recorded as part of our period end closing and consolidation process 
as a result  during  we incorrectly recorded journal entries regarding directors fees  discount ticket and other revenue  capitalized interest  and accrued expenses 
during  we incorrectly recorded journal entries regarding other revenue and accrued expenses 
these errors impact the quarterly results of operations presented in note the financial statements  notes thereto and related disclosures contained in this annual report on form k as of december  and for the years ended december  and and for each of the four quarters in and the first three quarters of have been restated to adjust for the errors noted above 
these restatements reflect a million increase to accumulated deficit at january  as well as adjustments to net property plant and equipment  capital leases  financing obligations  other assets  deferred expenses and accrued expenses 
the effect of the restatements on earnings per common share was as follows basic diluted the following discussion of our financial condition and operating results should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our audited annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
results of operations financial reporting during reorganization in connection with our bankruptcy proceedings  we were required to report in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code  sop 
sop requires  among other things  i that pre petition liabilities that are subject to compromise be segregated in our consolidated balance sheet as liabilities subject to compromise and ii the identification of all transactions and events that are directly associated with our reorganization in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents seasonality typically  movie studios release films with the highest expected revenues during the summer and the holiday period between thanksgiving and christmas  causing seasonal fluctuations in revenues 
however  movie studios are increasingly introducing more popular film titles throughout the year 
in addition  in years where christmas falls on a weekend day  our revenues are typically lower because our patrons generally have shorter holiday periods away from work or school 
revenues we derive almost all of our revenues from box office admissions and concession sales 
we recognize admissions revenues when movie tickets are sold at the box office  and concession sales revenues when the products are sold in the theatre 
admissions and concession sales revenues depend primarily upon attendance  ticket price and the price and volume of concession sales 
our attendance is affected by the quality and timing of movie releases and our ability to obtain films that appeal to patrons in our markets 
we record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admission and concession revenue when a holder redeems a gift card or other advanced sale type certificate 
we recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates upon expiration 
expenses film exhibition costs vary according to box office admissions and are accrued based on the specified splits of receipts in firm term agreements with movie distributors 
the agreements usually provide for a decreasing percentage of box office admissions to be paid to the movie studio over the first few weeks of the movie s run  subject to a floor for later weeks 
where firm terms do not apply  film exhibition costs are accrued based on the expected success of the film over a thirty to sixty day period and estimates of the final settlement with the movie studio 
settlements between us and the movie studios are completed four to six weeks after the movie s run 
concession costs of sales are incurred as products are sold 
we purchase substantially all of our beverage supplies from the coca cola company and the pepsi cola company 
we purchase substantially all of our other concession supplies from a single vendor  showtime concession  of which we are the principal customer 
other theatre operating costs include labor  utilities and occupancy  and facility lease expenses 
labor costs have both a variable and fixed cost component 
during non peak periods  a minimum number of staff is required to operate a theatre facility 
however  to handle attendance volume increases  theatre staffing is increased during peak periods and thus salaries and wages vary in relation to revenues 
utilities  repairs and maintenance services also have variable and fixed costs components 
our occupancy expenses and property taxes are primarily fixed costs  as we are generally required to pay applicable taxes  insurance and fixed minimum rent 
in addition  several of our theatre leases contain provisions for contingent rent whereby a portion of our rent expense is based on an agreed upon percentage of revenue exceeding a specified level 
in these theatres  rental expenses vary directly with changes in revenue 
our general and administrative expenses include costs not specific to theatre operations  and are composed primarily of corporate overhead 
net operating losses as of december   after utilizing approximately million of operating loss carryforwards for  we had approximately million of federal and state operating loss carryforwards with which to offset our future taxable income 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the year we are limited in using our net operating losses 
such limitation is projected to be million per year for the first five years beginning and will decrease to approximately million per year thereafter 
our ability to utilize such net operating losses is also subject to certain uncertainties regarding the application of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  to prior changes in ownership of the company  including the change resulting from our reorganization in january and the change resulting from our sale of shares in connection with the offering of august see risk factors we may be limited in our ability to utilize  or may not be able to utilize  net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability for more information regarding these uncertainties

we recognized an income tax expense of million for the year ended december   representing a combined federal and state income tax rate of  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  during the quarter ended december   we analyzed the available evidence and concluded it was more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized in future periods 
therefore  the million valuation allowance was released creating an income tax benefit for the evidence management considered included operating income for and  our subsequent stock offering and refinancing  resulting in significant prospective interest expense reduction  and anticipated operating income and cash flows for future periods in sufficient amounts to realize the net deferred tax assets 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our revenues are collected in cash and credit card payments 
because we receive our revenues in cash prior to the payment of related expenses  we have an operating float which partially finances our operations 
we had a working capital deficit of million as of december  compared to working capital of million at december  the change in working capital is primarily due to our significant capital expenditure program in at december   we had available borrowing capacity of million under our revolving credit facility and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
the material terms of our revolving credit facility including limitation on our ability to freely use all the available borrowing capacity are described below in material credit agreements and covenant compliance 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this change was due to reduced profit from operations related primarily to lower revenues and higher overall general operating expenses  changes in accounts payable from payments made to creditors and an increase in interest expense on our long term financing obligations 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  due to purchases of property and equipment of million and our purchase of gkc theatres for million 
for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  due to our may debt refinancing and the purchase of treasury stock in connection with stock grants exercised in net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this change is due to increased profit from operations related primarily to lower interest expenses  offset by changes in accounts payable  payments to general unsecured creditors and other reorganization items 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  due to increased construction of new theatres 
for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to net cash used of million for the year ended december  due to loan fees associated with our refinancing and dividends paid 
our liquidity needs are funded by operating cash flow  sales of surplus assets  availability under our credit agreements and short term float 
the exhibition industry is very seasonal with the studios normally releasing their premiere film product during the holiday season or summer months 
this seasonal positioning of film product makes our needs for cash vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
additionally  the ultimate performance of the film product any time during the calendar year will have a dramatic impact on our cash needs 
we plan to make approximately million in capital expenditures for calendar year the revolving credit facility currently does not limit our capital expenditures 
we anticipate we will add approximately four theatres with screens during the course of and close approximately nine theatres with screens in older theatres where leases will not be renewed 
the expenses associated with exiting these closed theatres typically relate to costs associated with removing owned equipment for redeployment in other locations and are not material to our operations 
our ability to service our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate this cash will depend largely on future operations 
based upon our current level of operations  we believe that cash flow from operations  available cash  sales of surplus assets and borrowings under our credit agreements will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
however  the possibility exists that  if our liquidity needs are not met and we are unable to service our indebtedness  we could come into default under any of our debt instruments  causing the agents or trustees for those instruments to declare all payments due immediately or  in the case of the senior debt  to issue a payment blockage to the more junior debt 
a similar situation contributed to the circumstances that led us to file our voluntary petition for relief under chapter in august  as described in our reorganization 
we cannot make assurances that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow to fund our liquidity needs 
we are dependent to a large degree on the public s acceptance of the films released by the studios 
we are also subject to a high degree of competition and low barriers of entry into our industry 
in the future  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on 
table of contents or before maturity 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or raise additional capital through other means  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we have insufficient cash flow to fund our liquidity needs and are unable to refinance our indebtedness or raise additional capital  we could come into default under our debt instruments as described below 
in addition  we may be unable to pursue growth opportunities in new and existing markets and to fund our capital expenditure needs 
material credit agreements and covenant compliance as described below  our credit and leasing facilities contain certain restrictive provisions which  among other things  limit additional indebtedness  limit the payment of dividends and other defined restricted payments  require that certain debt to capitalization ratios be maintained and require minimum levels of defined cash flows 
recent financing transactions senior secured credit facilities on may   we entered into a credit agreement with bear  stearns co 
inc  as sole lead arranger and sole book runner  wells fargo foothill  inc  as documentation agent  and bear stearns corporate lending inc  as administrative agent

also  we terminated our former million term loan  and repaid approximately million in principal  
million of accrued interest and paid million in prepayment fees 
we recognized a million loss on our extinguishment of debt which consisted of million of loan fees related to our february  credit facilities and a million prepayment premium on the retirement of our former term loan 
on june   we drew down million of the million delayed draw term loan to repurchase our outstanding million of senior subordinated notes due and to repay related fees and expenses 
at this time  the portion of the delayed draw term loan commitment which was not used for this repurchase was cancelled 
as described in the fourth and fifth amendments to our senior secured credit agreement  the interest rate for borrowings under our outstanding revolving and term loans is set to a margin above the london interbank offered rate libor or base rate  as the case may be  based on our corporate credit ratings from moody s investors service  inc and standard poor s rating services in effect from time to time  with the margin ranging from to for loans based on libor and to for loans based on the base rate

in addition  as described in the fifth amendment  we have also agreed  that by october   we will enter into and maintain hedging agreements to the extent necessary to provide that at least of the aggregate principal amount outstanding on our term loans is subject either to a fixed interest rate or interest rate protection through a date not earlier than may  the final maturity date of the term loan facility and delayed draw term loan facility is may  the interest rate for borrowings under the revolving credit facility for the initial six month period was set from time to time at our option subject to certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement at either a specified base rate plus or the eurodollar base rate divided by the difference between one and the eurocurrency reserve requirements plus 
thereafter  the applicable rates of interest under the revolving credit facility are based on our consolidated leverage ratio  with the margins applicable to base rate loans ranging from to  and the margins applicable to eurodollar loans as defined in the credit agreement ranging from to 
the rate at june  was  on june   we converted the rate to a day libor based rate  which was 
the final maturity date of the revolving credit facility is may  if we repay the term loans prior to june   we will be subject to a prepayment fee for optional and most mandatory prepayments  unless the prepayment results from a change of control transaction or the issuance by us of subordinated debt of up to million 
the credit agreement requires that mandatory prepayments be made from of the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales and dispositions and issuances of certain debt  various percentages ranging from to depending on our consolidated leverage ratio of excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement  and of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of certain equity and capital contributions 
the senior secured credit facilities contain covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability  and that of our restricted subsidiaries  to pay dividends or make any other restricted payments  incur additional indebtedness  create liens on our assets  make certain investments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  consolidate  merge or otherwise transfer all or any substantial part of our assets  enter into transactions with our affiliates  and engage in any sale leaseback  synthetic lease or similar transaction involving any of our assets 
the senior secured credit facilities also contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified ratios of funded debt to adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda to interest expense 
the terms governing each of these ratios are defined in the credit agreement  as amended 
generally  the senior secured credit facilities do not place restrictions on our ability to make capital expenditures 
however  we may not make any capital expenditure if any default or event of default under the credit agreement has occurred and is continuing or would result  or if such default or event of default would occur as a result of a breach of certain financial covenants contained in the credit agreement on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the capital expenditure 
our failure to comply with any of these covenants  including compliance with the financial ratios  is an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities  in which case  the administrative agent may  and if requested by the lenders holding a certain minimum percentage of the commitments shall  terminate the revolving credit facility and the delayed draw term loan commitments with respect to additional advances and may declare all or any portion of the obligations under the revolving credit facility and the term loan 
table of contents facilities due and payable 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants 
other events of default under the senior secured credit facilities include our failure to pay principal on the loans when due and payable  or its failure to pay interest on the loans or to pay certain fees and expenses subject to applicable grace periods  the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the credit agreement  or a breach or default by us or our subsidiaries on the payment of principal of any indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement in an aggregate amount greater than million 
the senior secured credit facilities are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries and secured by a perfected first priority security interest in substantially all of our present and future assets 
subsequent event of default we had not submitted audited financial statements for the year ended december  by the th day following the end of the previous fiscal year nor had we submitted unaudited financial statements for the three month period ended march  by the th day following the end of such three month period as required by the financial covenants under our senior secured credit facility 
on april   we obtained a waiver for the covenant regarding delivery of our audited financial statements for the year ended december  by entering into a second amendment to the credit agreement with bear  stearns co 
inc  and the other lending parties 
this second amendment  which had an effective date of march   extended the date by which we were to submit audited financial statements for the year ended december  to the lenders to may  on may   we obtained a second waiver for delivery of such audited financial statements by entering into a third amendment to the credit agreement with bear  stearns co 
inc and the other lending parties extending the delivery date to june  the third amendment also included a waiver regarding the delivery of the unaudited financial statements for the three month period ended march   extending the delivery date of such unaudited financial statements to june  effective june   we entered into a fourth amendment to our senior secured credit agreement with the lending parties thereunder  which included an extension of the deadline for the delivery of our audited financial statements for the year ended december  and unaudited financial statements for the three month period ended march  until july  effective july   we entered into a fifth amendment to our senior secured credit agreement  which included i an extension of the deadline for the delivery of our audited financial statements for the year ended december  until september   ii an extension of the deadline for delivery of our unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended march  until september   and iii an extension of the deadline for delivery of our unaudited financial statements for the quarters ended june  and september  until december  the fifth amendment also provides that until we have delivered to the lenders the audited financial statements for the year ended december  and the unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended march   the maximum principal amount of indebtedness that we may incur under the million revolving credit facility comprising part of the senior secured credit agreement is million 
in addition  the maximum principal amount of indebtedness that we may incur under the revolving credit facility will continue to be limited to million if we are unable to deliver our unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended june  by august  or if we are unable to deliver our unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended september  by november   until such time as these unaudited financial statements are delivered 
the amendments provide for waivers of certain defaults under the credit agreement  including the default resulting from our senior subordinated notes being accelerated 
in addition  the fourth amendment permitted our existing undrawn million delayed draw term loan commitment to be used to repay or repurchase our outstanding million of senior subordinated notes and to pay related fees and expenses upon the acceleration of such notes 
on june   we drew down million on this delayed draw term loan to repay our outstanding senior subordinated notes  all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and certain other fees and expenses related thereto 
these notes are no longer outstanding and the related indenture is no longer in effect 
the undrawn portion of the delayed draw term loan terminated upon the funding of such million 
see senior subordinated notes below 

table of contents senior subordinated notes on february   we completed an offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due february  to institutional investors 
as discussed further below  on june   we drew down million on our delayed draw term loan to repay our outstanding senior subordinated notes  all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and certain other fees and expenses related thereto 
the notes are no longer outstanding and the indenture governing the notes is no longer in effect 
the indenture contained covenants  which  among other things  limited our ability  and that of our restricted subsidiaries  to make restricted payments  create liens on our assets  consolidate  merge or otherwise transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets  engage in certain sales of less than all or substantially all of our assets  incur additional indebtedness  issue certain types of stock  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition  under the terms of the indenture governing the notes  we were prohibited from incurring any subordinated debt that was senior in any respect in right of payment to the notes 
we completed an exchange of the notes for registered notes with the same terms in august  upon a change of control  as defined in the indenture  subject to certain exceptions  we were required to offer to repurchase from each holder all or any part of each holder s notes at a purchase price of of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase 
the indenture contained customary events of default for agreements of that type  including payment defaults  covenant defaults  bankruptcy defaults and cross acceleration defaults 
if any event of default under the indenture occurred and was continuing  then the trustee or the holders of at least in principal amount of the then outstanding notes could declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately 
see subsequent event of default below 
our subsidiaries had guaranteed the notes and such guarantees were junior and subordinated to the subsidiary guarantees of our senior debt on the same basis as the notes were junior and subordinated to the senior debt 
interest at per annum from the issue date to maturity was payable on the notes each february and august the notes were redeemable at our option under certain conditions 
in conjunction with the refinancing  we wrote off loan fees relating to the post bankruptcy credit facilities of million and paid pre payment premiums in the amount of million to retire our senior subordinated notes 
subsequent event of default on april   the trustee for the senior subordinated notes notified us that we were in violation of the covenant requiring us to file our annual report on form k with the sec within the time frame specified by the sec s rules and regulations  thereby triggering a default under the note indenture 
the notice further stated that if this default continued for an additional sixty days then an event of default under the note indenture would occur 
we did not file our annual report on form k on or before june  and did not receive the requisite consents to obtain a waiver of the default under the note indenture 
consequently  the default was not cured during the day cure period and therefore constituted an event of default under the note indenture which entitled the trustee under the notes and or the holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes to declare all of the notes immediately due and payable 
on june   we received notice from the holders of over in aggregate principal amount of the notes that such holders had accelerated the notes 
as a consequence  on june   million in aggregate principal 
table of contents amount of the notes representing all of the outstanding notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon became immediately due and payable 
as permitted under the fourth amendment to our senior secured credit agreement with the lending parties thereunder  we borrowed million under our existing delayed draw term loan commitment and repaid all of the outstanding notes on june  the notes are no longer outstanding and the indenture governing the notes is no longer in effect

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing transactions or arrangements other than disclosed in the table above 
asset impairments in   and  we identified impairments of asset values for certain theatres which we reflected as operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements 
the table below sets out certain information concerning these impairments in millions except number of theatres and screens reduction in carrying values reduction in accumulated depreciation and amortization impairment charge included in operations number of theatres affected number of screens affected the impairment charges were primarily caused by reductions in estimated theatre cash flows due to the impact of new or increased competition on certain older  auditorium style theatres  negative evaluation of the operating results produced from theatres previously converted to discount theatres  or our inability to improve a marginal theatre s operating results to a level that would support the carrying value of the long lived assets 
when an impairment was identified  the impairment charge recorded reduced the recorded amount of the long lived asset to its fair value 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to exhibition costs  leasing transactions  depreciation of property and equipment  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies and  in particular  those related to impairment of long lived assets including goodwill 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and such difference could be material 
all critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
revenue recognition we derive almost all of our revenues from box office admissions and concession sales 
we recognize admissions revenues when movie tickets are sold at the box office and concession revenues when the products are sold in the theatre 
admissions and concession sales revenues depend primarily upon attendance  ticket price and the price and volume of concession sales 
our attendance is affected by the quality and timing of movie releases and our ability to obtain films that appeal to patrons in our markets 
we record proceeds from the sale of gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates in current liabilities and recognize admission and concession revenue when a holder redeems a gift card or other advanced sale type certificate 
we recognize unredeemed gift cards and other advanced sale type certificates as revenue upon expiration 
expenses film exhibition costs vary according to box office admissions and are accrued based on the specified splits of receipts in firm term agreements with movie distributors 
the agreements usually provide for a decreasing percentage of box office admissions to be paid to the movie studio over the first few weeks of the movie s run  subject to a floor for later weeks 
where firm terms do not apply  film exhibition costs are accrued based on the expected success of the film over a thirty to sixty day period and estimates of the final settlement with the movie studio 
settlements between us and the movie studios are completed four to six weeks after the movie s run 
property and equipment property and equipment are carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  or cost adjusted for recognized impairments 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the asset s carrying amount or its fair value less costs to sell 
amortization of assets recorded under capital leases is included with depreciation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we compute depreciation on a straight line basis as follows building and improvements years leasehold improvements years capital leases years equipment years number of years is based on the lesser of the useful life or the reasonably assured term of the applicable lease 
impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as a purchase 
the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  were adopted on january  the provisions prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and require that these assets be tested periodically for impairment at least annually 
we consider all of our consolidated operations to be our reporting unit for sfas purposes 
we test goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or on an interim basis should an event occur that may reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
as of december  and  our financial statements included acquisition related goodwill and other intangibles of million and million  net of previous amortization  respectively 
we account for our property and equipment in accordance with the sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
we review our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically review and monitor our internal management reports and the competition in our markets for indicators of impairment 
we consider a trend of operating results that are not in line with management s expectations to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
an additional impairment indicator used by management is the existence of competition in a market  either from third parties or from our own expansion 
for purposes of sfas  assets are evaluated for impairment at the theatre level except when multiple theatres are located in the same geographic area 
management believes this is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
we deem there to be an impairment if a 
table of contents forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the theatre or market  including estimated disposal value if any  is less than its carrying amount 
if there is a determination of an impairment  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the theatre or market exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on management s estimates which are based on using the best information available  including prices for similar theatres or the results of valuation techniques such as discounting estimated future cash flows 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
see asset impairments above for additional information regarding the effects on the  and consolidated financial statements 
bankruptcy matters as debtors in possession  we had the right  subject to bankruptcy court approval and certain other limitations  to assume or reject executory contracts and unexpired leases during our reorganization 
any damages resulting from rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases were treated as general unsecured claims in our reorganization 
during our reorganization  we received approval from the bankruptcy court to reject theatre leases on of our theatre locations 
on february   we filed a motion seeking an order entering a final decree closing the bankruptcy cases 
on march   the united states bankruptcy court of the district of delaware entered a final decree closing the bankruptcy cases 
in conjunction with the closure of the bankruptcy cases on march   we sealed all remaining disputed claims and reversed all accruals for bankruptcy related professional fees 
leases we operate most of our theatres under non cancelable lease agreements 
these leases generally provide for the payment of fixed monthly rentals  property taxes  common area maintenance  insurance and repairs 
certain of these leases provide for escalating lease payments over the terms of the leases 
at our option  we can renew a substantial portion of our theatre leases  at the then fair rental rate  for various periods with the maximum renewal period generally totaling years 
we determine the appropriate accounting for each theatre based on applying principles of sfas  as amended  and related authoritative accounting literature 
accordingly  we classify the following arrangements as capital leases a the lease transfers ownership of the theatre property to us by the end of the lease term  b the lease contains a bargain purchase option  c the lease term is equal to or greater than or more of the economic life of the leased property  or d the present value of the minimum lease payments equals or exceeds of the fair value of the leased property 
as to those arrangements that are classified as capital leases  we record property under capital leases and a capital lease obligation in an amount equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments to be made over the life of the lease at the beginning of the lease term  or the fair value of the leased property 
the property under capital lease is amortized on a straight line basis as a charge to expense over the lease term  as defined  or the economic life of the leased property  whichever is less 
during the lease term  as defined  each minimum lease payment is allocated between a reduction of the lease obligation and interest expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the lease obligation 
in regard to those leases that are classified as operating leases  for accounting purposes  the total amount of base rentals over the terms of the leases is charged to expense on the straight line method over the lease terms  as defined 
furthermore  rental cost is recognized on a straight line basis with any differences between rental payments and straight line rent adjusted through deferred rental liability 
percentage rent several leases have a contingent component called percentage rent 
percentage rent is based on a percentage of defined revenue factors over a fixed breakpoint for the lease year as described within the lease 
we recognize contingent rent expense prior to achievement of the fixed breakpoint when it becomes probable that the breakpoint will be achieved 
percentage rent for capital leases and leases accounted for as financing obligations is charged to interest expense 
financing obligations we are considered the owner of certain assets during construction under the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction eitf  if we pay or can be required to pay any portion of the construction costs 
once construction is completed  we consider the requirements under sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
table of contents sale leaseback transactions involving real estate sales type leases of real estate  definition of the lease term  and initial direct costs of direct financing leases sfas  for sale leaseback treatment  and if the arrangement does not meet such requirements  we record the project s construction costs funded by the landlord as a financing obligation 
the obligation is amortized over the financing term based on the payments designated in the contract 
under certain arrangements  the last payment is settled through non cash consideration consisting of the property subject to the financing obligation 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it was more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
for the year ended december   we determined that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets would be realized in the future and accordingly  it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance and recognize a tax benefit of million 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which became effective december  fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
we own certain properties that may contain asbestos which under certain conditions must be remediated 
as a result of adopting fin  we will increase the value of our recorded tangible assets at the time we recognize the associated conditional asset retirement obligation 
we adopted fin in the fourth quarter of and recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of approximately thousand 
the charge was recorded net of taxes of thousand in the income statement line item of cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
additionally  we recorded a conditional asset retirement obligation caro of approximately thousand 
the balances represent the fair value of our potential obligation to remediate asbestos or other environmental contaminants associated with theatres we own that were constructed prior to annual accretion of the liability and depreciation expense will be recorded each year for the theatres until the obligation year is reached  either by sale of the property  demolition or some other future event such as a government action 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based compensation payments and supersedes the current accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r is effective for all annual periods beginning after june  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to the adoption of sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to use fair value to measure stock based compensation awards 
the intrinsic value method of accounting  which apb allowed  resulted in no expense for many awards of stock options where the exercise price of the option equaled the price of the underlying stock at grant date 
under sfas r  the fair value of the award is not re measured after its initial estimation on the grant date except under specific circumstances 
we adopted sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal using the modified prospective method and will continue to evaluate the impact of sfas r on our operating results and financial condition 
the pro forma information in note  notes to consolidated financial statements  presents the estimated compensation charges under sfas r 
as a result of the provisions of sfas r and sab  we expect the compensation charges under sfas r to be approximately million before income taxes for fiscal however  our assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we have evaluated other valuation methods and have decided to implement the black scholes option pricing model  the most appropriate for us 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements for the calculation of our stock based compensation plans under apb and sfas r 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued its revision to fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb 
fin 
we adopted the provisions of fin in march variable interest entities are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
fin requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity for financial reporting purposes 
application of fin is required in financial statements of publicly held corporations that have interests in variable interest entities also referred to as special purpose entities for periods after march  we evaluated the partnerships in which we have an investment referred to as investment in unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated balance sheet and determined that they are not variable interest entities 
accordingly  fin has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards fin 
fin is effective january  and would require us to record any change in net assets that results from the application of fin as an adjustment to retained earnings 
fin is applicable to all uncertain positions for taxes accounted for under sfas  and is not intended to be applied by analogy to other taxes  such as sales taxes  value add taxes  or property taxes 
the scope of fin includes any position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including the decision to exclude from the return certain income or transactions 
fin makes clear that its guidance also applies to positions such a excluding income streams that might be deemed taxable by the taxing authorities  asserting that a particular equity restructuring eg  a spin off transaction is tax free when that position might be uncertain  or the decision to not file a tax return in a particular jurisdiction for which such a return might be required 
fin requires that we make qualitative and quantitative disclosures  including discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next months  a description of open tax years by major jurisdictions  and a roll forward of all unrecognized tax benefits  presented as a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the unrecognized tax benefits on a aggregated basis 
we do not anticipate the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
recent developments we have entered into a master license agreement  dated as of december  the license agreement  with christie aix  inc  a delaware corporation christie aix 
christie aix is an affiliate of christie digital systems usa  inc christie usa and access integrated technologies  inc accessit 
pursuant to the license agreement we have been granted a license to install and use up to  digital cinema projection systems including dci compliant k digital projectors  satellite transmission equipment  central library servers and related software and other hardware collectively  the digital equipment 
the initial term of the license agreement continues until december   provided that we may renew the license agreement for successive one year periods for up to ten additional years 
we have agreed to pay a one time software license fee in the amount of for each screen installed with the digital equipment 
we must also pay an fee for each movie or non traditional digital content delivered by accessit for exhibition using the digital equipment  payable for each screen that will exhibit the relevant movie or other non traditional digital content 
pursuant to the license agreement  christie aix will install the digital equipment for up to  of our screens by october   further  christie aix is required to install within any given theatre  a minimum amount of digital equipment such that more than of the individual theatre s screens are so equipped 
the installation costs are being capitalized as prepaid rent and will be subsequently amortized into rent expense over the fifteen year life of the initial arrangement 
the scope of our license includes the exhibition of traditional motion picture content  the exhibition of pre feature on screen advertising and the exhibition of non traditional content 
we have designated accessit as our preferred content delivery service for non traditional content and agreed to pay a fee of of the gross revenues derived by us from each exhibition of such non traditional content up to a maximum of  payable per exhibition 
upon an event of default by us under the license agreement  christie aix has the right to retake possession of the digital equipment and the right to recover any and all damages  including the loss of fees  costs and expenses 
in addition  we and christie aix have indemnified each other for damages arising out of the use  operation or possession of the digital equipment 

table of contents we have also entered into a digital cinema service agreement  dated as of december  the service agreement  with christie usa 
pursuant to the service agreement  christie usa will provide installation  maintenance and other services with respect to the digital equipment and our mm projection systems 
the term of the service agreement runs concurrently with the term of the license agreement 
we have agreed to pay an annual service fee in the amount of  per screen subject to limited annual consumer price index adjustments for each screen installed with the digital equipment 
in addition  christie usa has agreed to accept  under certain conditions  up to  of our mm projection systems as payment towards the installation fees 
these service fees are being expensed as incurred 
we believe the implementation of digital cinema projection will allow us not only greater flexibility in showing feature films  but will also provide us with the capability to explore revenue enhancing alternative content programming 
digital film content can be easily moved to and from auditoriums in our theatres to maximize attendance 
the superior quality of digital could provide a competitive advantage to us in markets where we compete for film and patrons 
information about forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
in addition  we  or our executive officers on our behalf  may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the sec or in connection with oral statements made to the press  potential investors or others 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about our beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements

further  forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks 
we have floating rate debt instruments and  therefore  are subject to the market risk related to changes in interest rates 
interest paid on our debt is largely subject to changes in interest rates in the market 
our revolving credit facility and our seven year term loan credit facility are based on a structure that is priced over an index or libor rate option 
an increase of in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our million term loan by approximately million on an annual basis 
an increase of in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our million delayed draw term loan by approximately million on an annual basis 
if our million revolving credit agreement was fully drawn  a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by  on an annual basis 
we have theatre leases that have increases contingent on changes in the consumer price index cpi 
a change in the cpi would increase rent expense by million over the remaining lives of these leases  which management does not believe would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
