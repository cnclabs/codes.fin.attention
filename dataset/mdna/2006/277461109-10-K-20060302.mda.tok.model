item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve the most complex management judgments due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
revenue recognition kodak recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with services  including maintenance and training  and other elements  including software and products  the company allocates to  and recognizes revenue from  the various elements based on their fair value 
for full service solutions sales  which consist of the sale of equipment and software which may or may not require significant production  modification or customization  there are two acceptable methods of accounting percentage of completion accounting and completed contract accounting 
for certain of the company s full service solutions  the completed contract method of accounting is being followed by the company 
this is due to insufficient historical experience resulting in the inability to provide reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to the various stages of such contracts as would be necessary under the percentage of completion methodology 
when the company does have sufficient historical experience and the ability to provide reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and the costs applicable to the various stages of these contracts  the company will account for these full service solutions under the percentage of completion methodology 
at the time revenue is recognized  the company also records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given from a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
such incentive programs include cash and volume discounts  price protection  promotional  cooperative and other advertising allowances and coupons 
for those incentives that require the estimation of sales volumes or redemption rates  such as for volume rebates or coupons  the company uses historical experience and internal and customer data to estimate the sales incentive at the time revenue is recognized 
in the event that the actual results of these items differ from the estimates  adjustments to the sales incentive accruals would be recorded 
incremental direct costs ie costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of a contract which would not have been incurred but for the acquisition of the contract of a customer contract in a transaction that results in the deferral of revenue are deferred and netted against revenue in proportion to the related revenue recognized in each period if an enforceable contract for the remaining deliverable items exists  and delivery of the remaining items in the arrangement is expected to generate positive margins allowing realization of the deferred costs 
page allowance for doubtful accounts the company records and maintains a provision for doubtful accounts for customers based on a variety of factors including the company s historical experience  the length of time the receivable has been outstanding and the financial condition of the customer 
in addition  kodak regularly analyzes its customer accounts and  when it becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s overall financial condition  records a specific provision for uncollectible accounts to increase the allowance to the amount that is estimated to be uncollectible 
if circumstances related to specific customers were to change  the company s estimates with respect to the collectibility of the related receivables could be further adjusted 
however  losses in the aggregate have not exceeded management s expectations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of most inventories in the us is determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
the cost of all of the company s remaining inventories in and outside the us is determined by the first in  first out fifo or average cost method  which approximates current cost 
kodak reduces the carrying value of its inventory based on estimates of what is excess  slow moving and obsolete  as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these write downs are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if  in the future  the company determined that market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected and  therefore  inventory was overvalued  the company would be required to further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record a charge to earnings at the time such determination was made 
if  in the future  the company determined that inventory write downs were overstated and  therefore  inventory was undervalued  the company would recognize the increase to earnings through higher gross profit at the time the related undervalued inventory was sold 
however  actual results have not differed materially from management s estimates 
on january   the company elected to change its method of costing its us inventories to the fifo method  whereas in all prior years most of kodak s inventory in the us was costed using the lifo method 
the new method of accounting for inventory in the us was adopted because the fifo method will provide for a better matching of revenue and expenses given the rapid technological change in the company s products 
the fifo method will also better reflect the cost of inventory on the company s statement of financial position 
prior periods will be restated in future financial statements for comparative purposes in order to reflect the impact of this change in methodology from lifo to fifo 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  by first grouping its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group and  secondly  estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
the company estimates the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analyses of discounted cash flows or external appraisals 
the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the expected period over which the asset will be utilized  projected future operating results of the asset group  discount rate and long term growth rate 
page to assess goodwill for impairment  the company performs an assessment of the carrying value of its reporting units on an annual basis or when events and changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company s reporting units below their carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company would record an impairment charge to earnings to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units through internal analyses and external valuations  which utilize income and market valuation approaches through the application of capitalized earnings  discounted cash flow and market comparable methods 
these valuation techniques are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the projected future operating results of the reporting unit  discount rate  long term growth rate and appropriate market comparables 
the company s assessments of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  and its periodic review of the remaining useful lives of its long lived assets are an integral part of the company s ongoing strategic review of the business and operations  and are also performed in conjunction with the company s ongoing restructuring actions 
therefore  changes in the company s strategy  the company s ongoing digital transformation and other changes in the operations of the company could impact the projected future operating results that are inherent in the company s estimates of fair value  resulting in impairments in the future 
additionally  other changes in the estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term growth rate  which drive the valuation techniques employed to estimate the fair value of long lived assets and goodwill could change and  therefore  impact the assessments of impairment in the future 
in performing the annual assessment of goodwill for impairment  the company determined that no material reporting units carrying values exceeded their respective fair values 
see goodwill under note  significant accounting policies 
due to the realignment of the kodak operating model and change in reporting structure  as described in note  segment information  effective january   the company reassessed its goodwill for impairment during the first quarter of  and determined that no reporting units carrying values exceeded their respective estimated fair values based on the realigned reporting structure and  therefore  there is no impairment 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance as of december  of  million is attributable to million of net foreign deferred tax assets  including certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and  million of us net deferred tax assets  including current year losses and credits  which the company is unable to realize 
the company has considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for these valuation allowances 
if kodak were to determine that it would not be able to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future  for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if the company were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  for which there is currently a valuation allowance  would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
the company s effective tax rate considers the impact of undistributed earnings of subsidiary companies outside of the us deferred taxes have not been provided for the potential remittance of such undistributed earnings  as it is the company s policy to permanently reinvest its retained earnings 
however  from time to time and to the extent that the company can repatriate overseas earnings on essentially a tax free basis  the company s foreign subsidiaries will pay dividends to the us material changes in the company s working capital and long term investment requirements could impact the decisions made by management with respect to the level and source of future remittances and  as a result  the company s effective tax rate 
see note  income taxes 
page the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the company 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
warranty obligations management estimates expected product failure rates  material usage and service costs in the development of its warranty obligations 
at the time revenue is recognized  the company provides for the estimated costs of its warranties as a charge to cost of goods sold 
estimates are based on historical warranty experience and related costs to repair 
actual results have not differed materially from management s estimates 
in the event that the actual results of these items differ from the estimates  an adjustment to the warranty obligation would be recorded 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and its other postretirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these standards require that the amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
see note  retirement plans  and note  other postretirement benefits  for disclosure of i the nature of the company s plans  ii the amount of income and expense included in the company s consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december   and  iii the company s contributions and estimated future funding requirements and iv the amount of unrecognized losses at december  and kodak s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on the company s assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions  which are reviewed annually by the company  include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets eroa  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses and are amortized to earnings over the estimated future service period of the plan participants to the extent such total net unrecognized gains and losses exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligation or the market related value of assets 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in future assumptions would affect the company s pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations 
generally  the company bases the discount rate assumption for its significant plans on high quality corporate long term bond yields in the respective countries as of the measurement date 
specifically  for its us and canada plans  the company determines a discount rate using a cash flow model to incorporate the expected timing of benefit payments and a aa rated high quality corporate bond yield curve 
for the company s other non us plans  the discount rates are determined by comparison to published local long term high quality bond indices 
the eroa assumption is based on a combination of formal asset and liability studies  historical results of the portfolio  and management s expectation as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on the company s long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook and an assessment of the likely long term trends 
the company reviews its eroa assumption annually for the kodak retirement income plan krip 
to facilitate this review  every three years  or when market conditions change materially  the company undertakes a new asset and liability study to reaffirm the current asset allocation and the related eroa assumption 
in march  a new asset and liability modeling study was completed and the krip eroa assumption for remained at 
the krip eroa assumption is expected to remain at for as well 
given the decrease in the discount rate of basis points from for to for an increase in expected return on plan assets due to asset performance in  changes in demographic assumptions  resulting from the completion of assumption studies in  and a decrease in amortization expense relating to unrecognized actuarial losses in accordance with sfas no 
 total pension income from continuing operations before special termination benefits  curtailment losses and settlement losses for the major funded and unfunded defined benefit plans in the us is expected to increase from million in to million in pension expense from continuing operations before special benefits  curtailment losses and settlement losses in the company s major funded and unfunded non us defined benefit plans is projected to increase from million in to million in  which is primarily attributable to an increase in amortization expense relating to the unrecognized actuarial losses 
additionally  due in part to the decrease in the discount rate from for to for and a decrease in amortization expense relating to the unrecognized actuarial losses  the company expects the cost  before curtailment and settlement gains and losses  of its most significant postretirement benefit plan  the us plan  to approximate million in  as compared with for these estimates have been incorporated into the company s earnings outlook for page the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change to certain key assumptions used in the calculation of expense for the year ending december  and the projected benefit obligation pbo at december  for the company s major us and us defined benefit pension plans in millions impact on pre tax pension expense increase decrease impact on pbo december  increase decrease us non us us non us change in assumption basis point decrease in discount rate basis point increase in discount rate basis point decrease in eroa basis point increase in eroa in accordance with the guidance under sfas no 
 the company is required to record an additional minimum pension liability in its consolidated statement of financial position that is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation of its defined benefit pension plans 
during  due to the performance of the global equity markets  combined with decreasing discount rates  the company was required to increase its additional minimum pension liability for its major defined benefit plans by million and to record a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income a component of shareholders equity of million  net of taxes of million 
if the global equity markets performance improves and discount rates stabilize or improve in future periods  the company may be in a position to reduce its additional minimum pension liability and reverse the corresponding charges to shareholders equity 
conversely  if the global equity markets performance and discount rates continue to decline in future periods  the company may be required to increase its additional minimum pension liability and record additional charges to shareholders equity 
to mitigate the increase in its additional minimum pension liability and additional charges to shareholders equity  the company may elect to fund a particular plan or plans on a case by case basis 
page environmental commitments environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures 
the liabilities include accruals for sites owned by kodak  sites formerly owned by kodak  and other third party sites where kodak was designated as a potentially responsible party prp 
the amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates  which are determined using the astm standard e  standard guide for estimating monetary costs and liabilities for environmental matters 
the overall method includes the use of a probabilistic model that forecasts a range of cost estimates for the remediation required at individual sites 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for remediation and long term monitoring of the sites 
such estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of remediation 
kodak s estimate of its environmental liabilities may also change if the proposals to regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes of remediation are viewed as not acceptable  or additional exposures are identified 
the company has an ongoing monitoring and identification process to assess how activities  with respect to the known exposures  are progressing against the accrued cost estimates  as well as to identify other potential remediation sites that are presently unknown

expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock  management s estimate of implied volatility of the company s stock  and other factors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as historical exercise behavior  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is calculated using the us treasury yield curve  and is based on the expected term of the option 
the company uses historical data to estimate forfeitures

gross profit gross profit was  million for as compared with  million for  representing a decrease of million  or 
the gross profit margin was in the current year as compared with in the prior year

this increase is attributable to the reasons described above 
interest expense interest expense for was million as compared with million in the prior year 
this increase is related to higher interest rates in and higher debt levels in the current year as a result of borrowings to finance acquisitions 
other income charges  net the other income charges  net component includes principally investment income  income and losses from equity investments  foreign exchange  and gains and losses on the sales of assets and investments 
other income for the current year was million as compared with other income of million for the prior year 
the decline of million is primarily attributable to proceeds from two favorable legal settlements totaling million in  with no similar favorable legal settlements in also contributing to the decline for the year was a loss on foreign exchange of million due to the unhedged us dollar denominated note payable outside of the us relating to the kpg acquisition versus foreign exchange losses of million in future foreign exchange gains or losses arising from this note payable will be substantially offset by currency forward hedge contracts entered into on july  the decline was also impacted by million of charges  including a million impairment of the investment in lucky film as a result of an other than temporary decline in the market value of lucky s stock and a million asset impairment 
additionally  equity income from joint ventures declined by million due to the acquisitions of kpg and nexpress  which were formerly accounted for under the equity method  and are now consolidated in the company s statement of operations and included in the graphic communications group segment 
these items were partially offset by a net year over year increase of million from gains on the sale of properties and capital assets 
income tax benefit provision the company s annual effective tax rate from continuing operations decreased from a benefit rate of for to a provision rate of for the change is primarily attributable to the inability to recognize a benefit from losses in the us as a result of the requirement to record a valuation allowance against net us deferred tax assets 
page during the year ended december   the company recorded a tax provision of million representing an income tax rate on losses from continuing operations of 
the income tax rate of for the year ended december  differs from the company s statutory tax rate of primarily due to the inability to benefit losses in the us  which resulted in the recording of the valuation allowance charge against net us deferred tax assets in the amount of  million 
some of the other significant items that caused the difference from the statutory tax rate include non us tax benefits of million associated with total worldwide restructuring costs of  million  a benefit of million associated with rate differentials on operations outside the us  a benefit of million associated with export sales and manufacturing credits  a tax charge of million associated with the remittance of earnings from subsidiary companies outside of the us in connection with the american jobs creation act of  and a tax benefit of million resulting from the company s audit settlement with the internal revenue service for tax years covering through valuation allowance us during the third quarter of  based on management s assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets  the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against its net us deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  managements assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities  estimates of projected future taxable income  carryback potential and tax planning strategies 
prior to the company s third quarter assessment of realizability  it was believed  based on available evidence including tax planning strategies  that the company would more likely than not realize its net us deferred tax assets 
the third quarter assessment considered the following significant matters based upon some recent changes that occurred in the quarter in july  management announced plans to significantly accelerate its restructuring efforts and to significantly reduce the assets supporting its traditional business by the end of this global plan includes accelerating the reduction of traditional film assets from billion in january to approximately billion by and terminating approximately  employees 
these actions will have a negative impact on kodak s ability to generate taxable income in the us on october   the company entered into a new secured credit facility pursuant to which the borrowings in the us are collateralized by certain us assets  including the company s intellectual property assets 
thus  management determined that the previous tax planning strategy to sell the us intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary to generate taxable income in the us was no longer prudent nor feasible and should not be relied upon as part of the third quarter assessment of realizability of the company s us deferred tax assets 
based upon management s above mentioned september  assessment of realizability  management concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that the us net deferred tax assets would be realized and  as such  recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  management updated its assessment of the realizability of its net deferred tax assets 
as a result of management s assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets  which included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities  estimates of projected future taxable income  carryback potential and tax planning strategies  the company maintained that it was still no longer more likely than not that the us net deferred tax assets would be realized and  as such  increased the valuation allowance by approximately million relating to deferred tax benefits generated in the fourth quarter 
in addition  the company expects to record a valuation allowance on all us tax benefits generated in the future until an appropriate level of profitability in the us is sustained or until the company is able to generate enough taxable income through other tax planning strategies and transactions 
both the net deferred tax asset balances and the offsetting valuation allowance include estimates attributable to the recent acquisitions of kpg and creo 
deferred tax amounts attributable to these businesses are expected to be finalized during with the completion of the company s purchase accounting for these acquired entities 
as of december   the company had a valuation allowance of  million relating to its net deferred tax assets in the us of  million 
the valuation allowance of  million is attributable to i the charges totaling  million that were recorded in the third and fourth quarters of and ii a valuation allowance of million recorded in a prior year for certain state tax carryforward deferred tax assets relating to which management believes it is not more likely than not that the assets will be realized 
the remaining net deferred tax assets in excess of the valuation allowance of million relate to certain foreign tax credit deferred tax assets relating to which management believes it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized 
valuation allowance outside the us as of december   the company had a valuation allowance of approximately million relating to its deferred tax assets outside of the us of million 
the valuation allowance of million is attributable to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards relating to which management believes it is not more likely than not that the assets will be realized 
page loss earnings from continuing operations the loss from continuing operations for was  million  or per basic and diluted share  as compared with earnings from continuing operations for of million  or 
per basic and diluted share  representing a decrease of  million 
this decrease in earnings from continuing operations is attributable to the reasons described above 
digital film imaging systems worldwide revenues net worldwide sales for the d fis segment were  million for as compared with  million for  representing a decrease of million  or

 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the company 
in addition  fin clarifies when a company would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company adopted fin during the fourth quarter of fin requires that conditional asset retirement obligations  legal obligations to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event  be reported  along with associated capitalized asset retirement costs  at their fair values 
upon initial application  fin requires recognition of a liability  adjusted for cumulative accretion from the date the obligation was incurred until the date of adoption of fin  for existing asset retirement obligations  an asset retirement cost capitalized as an increase to the carrying amount of the associated long lived asset  and accumulated depreciation on the capitalized asset retirement cost

kodak records a liability equal to the estimated fair value of its obligation to perform asset retirement activities related to the asbestos  computed using an expected present value technique  when sufficient information exists to calculate the fair value 
kodak does not have a liability recorded related to each building that contains asbestos because kodak cannot estimate the fair value of its obligation for certain buildings due to a lack of sufficient information about the range of time over which the obligation may be settled through demolition  renovation or sale of the building
