what we do an executive summary we are a leading provider of egovernment services that help governments use the internet to reduce costs and provide a higher level of service to businesses and citizens 
we accomplish this currently through two divisions our core portal outsourcing businesses and our software services businesses 
in our core business  portal outsourcing  we enter into contracts primarily with state governments and design  build and operate web based portals on their behalf 
we enter into long term contracts  typically three to five years  and manage operations for each government partner through separate subsidiaries that operate as decentralized businesses with a high degree of autonomy 
our portals consist of web sites and applications that we build  which allow businesses and citizens to access government information online and complete transactions  including applying for a permit  retrieving driver s license records or filing a form or report 
we help increase our government partners revenues by expanding the distribution of their information assets and increasing the number of financial transactions conducted with governments 
we do this by marketing portal services and soliciting users to complete government based transactions and to enter into subscriber contracts that permit users to access the portal and the government information contained therein in exchange for transactional and or subscription user fees 
we are typically responsible for funding the up front investment and ongoing operational costs of the government portals 
our unique self funding business model allows us to reduce our government partners financial and technology risks and obtain revenues by sharing in the fees generated from egovernment services 
our clients benefit because they gain a centralized  customer focused presence on the internet 
businesses and citizens gain a faster  more convenient and more cost effective means to interact with governments 
on behalf of our government partners  we enter into separate agreements with various agencies and divisions of the government to provide specific services and to conduct specific transactions 
these agreements preliminarily establish the pricing of the transaction and data access services we provide and the division of revenues between the company and the government agency 
the government must approve prices and revenue sharing agreements 
we generally own all the applications developed under these contracts 
after completion of a defined contract term  the government agency typically receives a perpetual  royalty free license to the applications for use only 
if our contract were not renewed after a defined term  the government agency would be entitled to take over the portal in place with no future obligation of the company 
in some cases  we enter into contracts to provide consulting  development and management services to government portals in exchange for an agreed upon fee 
currently  we have contracts to provide portal outsourcing services for eighteen states under our self funding business model 
our closest competitors operate no more than one state portal each 
we also provide portal outsourcing services to three local governments 
our objective is to strengthen our position as the leading provider of internet based egovernment services 
key strategies to achieve this objective include renew all current outsourced government portal contracts we will strive to obtain renewal of all currently profitable outsourced government portal contracts 
in the history of our company  we have not lost a contract renewal opportunity or re bid process and are very proud of our highly reference able list of government partners 
in  we won a re bid competition and signed a new five year contract with tennessee  and won a re bid competition and signed a new contract for up to five years with alabama 
win new portal contracts we intend to increase our number of government partners by leveraging our strong relationships with current government partners and our reputation for providing proven egovernment services 
we intend to continue marketing our services to new governments 
our expansion efforts include developing relationships and sponsors throughout an individual government entity  pursuing strategic technology alliances  making presentations at conferences of government executives with responsibility for information technology policy  and developing contacts with organizations that act as forums for discussions between these executives 
in  we entered into a one year portal outsourcing contract with the state of south carolina that includes renewal options for up to four additional years 
also in  we entered into a five year portal outsourcing contract with the state of colorado that includes renewal options for up to four additional years 
increase transactional revenues from our existing government portals we intend to increase transactional revenues from our existing government portals by building new applications and services and increasing the adoption of existing portal applications and services 
we will accomplish this with new services offerings and expanded marketing initiatives 
in addition  we will work closely with the governance entities in our partner portals to evaluate the pricing of new and existing services to encourage higher usage and increased revenue streams 
we plan to continue our development of new online transactional services that enable government agencies to interact more effectively and efficiently with businesses  citizens and other government agencies 
we will continue to work with government agencies  professional associations and other organizations to better understand the current and future needs of our customers 
we will continue to work with our government partners to create awareness of the online alternatives to traditional government interaction through initiatives such as informational brochures  government voicemail recordings and inclusion of web site information on government communication materials 
in addition  we will continue to update our portals to highlight new government service information provided on the portals 
we plan to work with professional associations to directly and indirectly communicate to their members the potential convenience  ease of use and other benefits of the services our portals offer 
in addition to overall portal revenue growth  which includes both organic revenue growth and growth from new portal contract wins  an important financial metric that we use to gauge our success in increasing transactional revenues in our existing portal businesses is same state revenue growth 
we define same state revenue growth as the growth in revenues from states in operation and generating dmv revenues for at least two full years 
dmv revenues are transaction fees that we earn from the sale of driver history records through the portals we operate 
our long term goal is to grow same state revenues per year  absent online dmv record price increases 
same state portal revenues grew in  in and in as more fully described below  our same state revenue growth in was lower than normal due primarily to a year over year decrease in same state dmv revenues 
in  same state dmv revenues grew by primarily due to modest online dmv record price increases in two of our portal states in late and two portal states in late in  same state dmv revenues grew by primarily due to the dmv price increases in two of our portal states in late historically  such price increases have been infrequent  and our ability to grow same state dmv revenues has been limited  as such revenues have been driven by broader economic factors outside of our control 
an important component of same state revenue growth is the growth in non dmv transaction revenues  which are transaction fees generated by other means than from the sale of dmv records  for transactions conducted primarily by business users and  to a lesser extent  consumer users through our portals 
in  same state non dmv revenues grew  up from in and in we are able to grow non dmv revenues by continually deploying new revenue generating applications and by driving adoption of existing applications within our existing portal businesses 
we believe the key factor in organically growing our revenues is to continually focus on driving adoption  and on implementation of new non dmv revenue generating applications 
continue to aggressively grow operating margins and profitability in addition to driving same state revenue growth  we will continue to increase profitability by driving cost containment efforts throughout the company and maintaining a lean organizational structure that fosters entrepreneurial decision making and innovation and accentuates the strong financial leverage of our business model 
an important financial metric that we use to gauge our portal profitability is portal gross profit percentage  or gross profit rate  which is calculated by dividing portal gross profit portal revenues minus cost of portal revenues  excluding depreciation by portal revenues 
our long term outlook is for our portal gross profit rate to be in the range 
our portal gross profit rate was in and  up from in new portal contract wins can have a short term negative impact on our gross profit percentage during the start up phase of a portal  as we incur costs to develop and implement the portal infrastructure prior to the time we begin to generate transaction revenues 
our portal gross profit could be similarly impacted in the future if we are successful in winning new portal contracts 
in addition  a growing percentage of our non dmv revenues are generated from online applications whereby users pay for information or transactions via credit cards 
we typically earn a percentage of the credit card transaction amount  but also must pay an associated fee to the merchant bank that processes the credit card transaction 
we earn a lower gross profit percentage on these transactions as compared to our other non dmv applications 
however  we anticipate these revenues and the associated merchant card fees to continue to increase in the future  as these transactions contribute favorably to our operating income growth 
we carefully monitor our portal gross profit percentage to strike the balance between generating a solid return for our shareholders and delivering value to our government partners through reinvestment in our portal operations 
we also view selling administrative costs  expressed as a percentage of revenue  to be an important indicator of our success in controlling the year over year growth in our corporate level expenses 
selling administrative costs as a percentage of revenue were in  in  and in going forward  we expect selling administrative costs as a percentage of revenues to continue to decline modestly as our revenues grow and our corporate expenses increase modestly year over year 
finally  our consolidated operating margin operating income or loss divided by consolidated revenues is an important measure of our overall profitability 
this metric decreased to in  down from in  but up from in the decrease in was mainly due to the effect of the adjustment under percentage of completion accounting recorded in the first quarter of relating to our contract with the california secretary of state  which resulted in a million reduction in software services revenues in as further discussed below 
overview of business models and revenue recognition we classify our revenues and cost of revenues into two categories portal and software services 
the portal category includes revenues and cost of revenues primarily from our subsidiaries operating government portals on an outsourced basis 
the software services category includes revenues and cost of revenues primarily from our corporate filings  ethics elections and transportation businesses 
we currently derive revenue from two main sources transaction based fees and fees for application development 
each of these revenue types and the corresponding business models are further described below 
our portal outsourcing businesses we categorize our portal revenues according to the underlying source of revenue 
a brief description of each category follows dmv transaction based these are transaction fees from the sale of electronic access to driver history records  referred to as dmv records  from our state portals to data resellers  insurance companies and other pre authorized customers on behalf of our state partners  and are generally recurring 
non dmv transaction based these are transaction fees from sources other than the sale of dmv records  for transactions conducted by business users and consumer users through our portals  and are generally recurring 
for a representative listing of non dmv services we currently offer through our portals  refer to part i  item in this form k 
software development portal management these are fees from the performance of software development projects and other time and materials services for our government partners 
while we actively market these services  they do not have the same degree of predictability as our transaction based revenues 
the highest volume  most commercially valuable service we offer is electronic access to dmv records through our insurance industry records exchange network 
this service accounted for approximately of our portals revenues in  in and in we believe that while this application will continue to be an important source of revenue  its contribution as a percentage of total revenues on an individual portal basis will decline modestly as other sources grow 
choicepoint  which resells these records to the auto insurance industry  accounted for approximately of portal revenues in and  and in we expect portal revenues as a percentage of total revenues to continue to increase in future years as we continue to wind down certain of our software services businesses 
in our outsourced portal businesses for  dmv transaction based revenues represented approximately of portal revenues  non dmv transaction based revenues represented approximately  and software development portal management represented 
we expect software development portal management revenues as a percentage of total portal revenues to decline in the future due to our focus on growing transaction based revenues  which are more predictable and recurring in nature 
approximately of our transaction based revenues related to business to government transactions  while the remaining related to citizen to government transactions 
transaction based revenues from our outsourced state portal business units are highly correlated to population  but are also affected by pricing policies established by government entities for public records  the number and growth of commercial enterprises and the government entity s development of policy and information technology infrastructure supporting electronic government 
choicepoint and other data resellers and companies who access dmv records electronically through our insurance industry records exchange network have entered into contracts with the portals our subsidiaries operate to request these records from the states of alabama  arkansas  colorado  hawaii  idaho  indiana  iowa  kansas  kentucky  maine  montana  nebraska  oklahoma  rhode island  south carolina  tennessee  utah and virginia 
under the terms of these contracts  we provide data resellers with driver s license and traffic records that vary by contract  for fees that currently range from to per record requested 
the fees charged to all entities that access dmv records are the same for records of a particular state 
we typically collect the entire fee  of which a certain portion is remitted to the state by statute 
these contracts are generally self renewing until canceled by one side or the other  and generally may be terminated at any time after days notice 
these contracts may be terminated immediately at the option of any party upon a material breach of the contract by the other party 
furthermore  these contracts are immediately terminable if the state statute allowing for the public release of these records is repealed 
we charge for electronic access to records on a per record basis and  depending upon government policies  also on a fixed or sliding scale bulk basis 
our fees are set by negotiation with the government agencies that control the records and are typically approved by a government sanctioned oversight body 
we recognize revenues from transactions primarily transaction based information access fees and filing fees on an accrual basis net of the transaction fee due to the government  and we bill end user customers primarily on a monthly basis 
we typically receive a majority of payments via electronic funds transfer and credit card within days of billing and remit payment to governments within to days of the transaction 
the costs that we pay state agencies for data access are accrued as accounts receivable and accounts payable at the time revenue from the access of public information is recognized 
we must remit a certain amount or percentage of these fees to government agencies regardless of whether we ultimately collect the fees 
the pricing of transactions varies by the type of transaction and by state 
we expense as incurred all employee costs to start up  operate and maintain outsourced government portals as costs of performance under the contracts because  after the completion of a defined contract term  the government entities with which we contract typically receive a perpetual  royalty free license to the applications we developed 
such costs are included in cost of portal revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
our software services businesses ucc and corporate filings our ucc and corporate filings software development business derives the majority of its revenues from fixed price application development contracts and recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion method 
at december   this business was primarily engaged in servicing its contract with the california secretary of state  as further discussed below  and no longer markets its applications and services in respect of new engagements 
ethics elections our ethics elections business derives the majority of its revenues from time and materials application development and maintenance outsourcing contracts and recognizes revenues as services are provided 
at december   our ethics elections business was primarily engaged in servicing its contracts with the federal election commission and the state of michigan 
transportation our transportation business has historically derived the majority of its revenues from cost plus time and materials application development contracts with governments and recognizes revenues as services are provided 
revenues from our transportation business were not significant in  and we decided to wind down our transportation business in and do not expect to generate substantial revenues from this business in critical accounting policies many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of generally accepted accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
note that the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies described below with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
application development contracts our ucc and corporate filings software development business  nic conquest  derives the majority of its revenues from fixed price application development contracts and recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion method  utilizing costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs for each contract 
this method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on our fixed price contracts and results in our recognizing contract revenues over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on management s estimates of contract revenues and costs 
contract losses are recognized in full when determined  and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability 
use of the percentage of completion method requires that management be able to reasonably estimate total contract costs and costs to complete at each reporting date 
we continuously review and reassess our estimates of contract profitability 
our ucc and corporate filings software development business has incurred substantial losses under its fixed price contracts primarily due to cost overruns 
as recently as the first quarter of  we recorded a million charge due to anticipated cost overruns on our contract with the california secretary of state as further discussed below and in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
it is possible that our costs will similarly exceed revenues in the future  as a result of unforeseen difficulties in the creation of an application called for in a contract  unforeseen challenges in ensuring compatibility with existing systems  rising development  subcontractor and personnel costs  delays in completing a contract  or other reasons 
if this occurs  particularly on our contract with the california secretary of state  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be seriously harmed 
because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating the costs of completion  it is at least reasonably possible that our estimates will change in the near term 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred income taxes for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we have a history of unprofitable operations prior to primarily due to operating losses incurred in our software services businesses 
these losses generated significant federal tax net operating losses  or nols 
we had available at december   total nol carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately million that will expire in the years million  million and million  respectively 
we became profitable in the second half of we expect the company to continue to be profitable and generate taxable income  and have focused the business on operations that have demonstrable ability to produce positive taxable income and sustainable cash flow in the future 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income from future operations to fully utilize the nol carryforwards prior to expiration 
based on our current projections  we expect to fully utilize the nol carryforwards by the end of the recorded amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
there is considerable management judgment necessary to determine future taxable income  and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
for additional discussion of deferred income taxes  see deferred tax assets section below and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
for the years ended december  and  total net deferred tax assets  including nol carryforwards  comprised approximately and  respectively  of our total assets 
financial analysis of years ended december   and in this section  we are providing more detailed information about our operating results and changes in financial position over the past three years 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
first quarter charge california secretary of state contract results of operations for the year ended december  include a million charge we recorded on our software services engagement with the california secretary of state sos in the first quarter of  as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
prior to the first quarter of  key elements of our obligations under the california sos contract were subcontracted to various third parties under fixed price contracts 
at the end of the first quarter of  as a result of system delivery issues and the concern over the ability of one of the two remaining subcontractors to meet the criteria set forth by the california sos  we determined we would assume the lead project manager role on the contract  which was previously performed by this subcontractor 
as a result of this change  we further evaluated the status of the project and concluded that a further modification to the management and oversight structure of the project was necessary to improve performance under the contract and that additional internal project management and technical personnel would be required on the engagement 
we also reevaluated the expected completion date of the project  which was previously estimated to be in the first quarter of  and determined to revise the estimated completion date to the end of as a result of our decision to commit these additional resources and the extension of the expected project completion date  we recorded a million adjustment under percentage of completion accounting in the first quarter of  as we expected to incur a loss of approximately million on this project  instead of a previously projected profit of approximately million 
the effect of the adjustment under percentage of completion accounting in our consolidated statements of income resulted in a reduction of software services revenues of approximately million and an increase in cost of software services revenues of approximately million 
the effect of the adjustment in our consolidated balance sheets was a reduction in unbilled revenues of approximately million and an increase in application development contracts a current liability of approximately million 
on march   we entered into an amendment to this contract with the california sos 
among other changes  the amendment reduces the aggregate contract value to from approximately million to approximately million and releases us from the obligation to deliver the business filings  or be  portion of the project  except for maintenance of hardware and delivery of be images as expressly set forth in the amendment 
the amendment also sets forth the final criteria in order for the california sos to accept the uniform commercial code  or ucc  portion of the project and move it into the maintenance and operations phase 
we are in the process of reviewing our cost estimates to complete based on the revised terms and conditions in the amendment and do not believe our estimated contract loss will exceed the million estimate established in the first quarter of however  because of the inherent uncertainties surrounding the ultimate outcome of subcontract negotiations between our subcontractors and us as a result of the amendment  it is at least reasonably possible that the estimate will change in the near term 
further  it is possible that we will similarly incur cost overruns in the future as we have in the past as a result of unforeseen difficulties in the creation of an application called for in the contract  unforeseen challenges in ensuring compatibility with existing systems  rising development  subcontractor and personnel costs or other reasons 
if this occurs  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we expect to record an adjustment under percentage of completion accounting in the first quarter of that will reduce both software services revenues and cost of software services revenues by approximately million in our consolidated statements of income 
the adjustment will also reduce unbilled revenues by approximately million  accrued contract expenses by approximately million and application development contracts by approximately million in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  subject to the uncertainties referred to above  this adjustment is not expected to affect operating income  net income or basic and diluted earnings per share

portal revenues 
in the analysis below  we have categorized our portal revenues according to the underlying source of revenue in thousands  with the corresponding percentage increase or decrease from the prior year period 

nic kxxjpg 
portal revenues for increased  or approximately million  over of this increase   or approximately million  was attributable to an increase in same state portal revenues states in operation and generating dmv revenues for two full years and  or approximately million  was primarily attributable to our new portals in south carolina million  which began to generate dmv revenues in june  and colorado million  which began to generate dmv revenues in october revenues related to our vermont and new hampshire portals  from which we primarily earn software development and portal management revenues  decreased by approximately million in increases in same state and new portal revenues were partially offset by a million decrease in revenues from our local portal business  primarily due to the wind down of certain of our less profitable local portals 
in the first quarter of  the company ceased providing portal outsourcing services to kent county  michigan and the city of tampa  florida 
currently  the only local portals the company services are those located in states where we operate an official state government portal 
same state portal revenues in increased  or approximately million  over primarily as a result of increased transaction revenues from our tennessee  indiana  arkansas  oklahoma and kansas portals  among others 
same state dmv transaction based revenues increased  or approximately million  in due mainly to price increases in two of our larger portal states in late same state non dmv transaction based revenues increased  or approximately million  in due to the addition of several new revenue generating applications in existing portals 
partially offsetting these increases was a  or approximately million  decrease in same state software development portal management revenues  as we continue to focus our growth efforts on recurring non dmv transaction based revenues  rather than on less predictable time and materials software development projects 
we expect same state revenue growth in to decrease to between and  due primarily to a decrease in same state dmv revenue growth 
same state dmv revenue growth is expected to range from to in  as we do not currently anticipate any new dmv price increases 
absent dmv price increases  same state dmv revenues have historically grown at a rate of to per year 
portal revenues for increased  or approximately million  over of this increase   or approximately million  was attributable to an increase in same state portal revenues and  or approximately million  was attributable to our newer portals including kentucky million  which began to generate dmv revenues in september  and alabama million  which began to generate dmv revenues in february these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our local portals  primarily due to the continued wind down of certain of our unprofitable local portal businesses 
in  the company ceased providing local portal services to dallas county  texas  the city of corpus christi  texas  and washtenaw county  michigan 
same state portal revenues in increased over primarily as a result of increased transaction revenues from several of our portals  most notably hawaii  montana  tennessee and utah 
our same state revenue growth in was higher than the growth we achieved in due in part to a increase approximately million in same state dmv revenues 
this increase was mainly attributable to modest dmv price increases in two portal states in late and in two portal states in late in addition  same state non dmv transaction based revenues increased  or approximately million  in due primarily to the addition of several new revenue generating applications in existing portals 
cost of portal revenues 
cost of portal revenues in increased  or approximately million  over of this increase   or approximately million  was attributable to an increase in same state cost of portal revenues  and  or approximately million  was primarily attributable to new state portal businesses in south carolina and colorado 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in operating expenses from our local portals as a result of the wind down of certain of our unprofitable local portal businesses 
same state cost of portal revenues in increased  or approximately million  primarily as a result of the addition of personnel in several of our portals due to our continued growth and reinvestment in our core business 
also contributing to the increase in same state cost of portal revenues was an increase in bank fees 
a growing percentage of our non dmv revenues are generated from online applications whereby users pay for information or transactions via credit cards 
on these transactions  we must pay an associated fee to the bank that processes the credit card transaction 
we earn a lower gross profit percentage on these transactions as compared to our other non dmv applications 
however  we anticipate these revenues and the associated credit card fees to continue to increase in the future  as these transactions contribute favorably to our operating income growth 
our portal gross profit rate was in and on a same state basis  our portal gross profit rate was  down from in while same state portal revenues grew by in  same state cost of portal revenues increased by approximately  as further discussed above 
additionally  our new south carolina and colorado portal businesses earned a lower gross profit percentage in their first year of operations as compared to our other state portal businesses 
new portal contract wins can have a short term negative effect on our gross profit percentage in the start up period of a portal as we incur costs to develop and implement the portal infrastructure prior to the time we begin to generate transaction revenues 
we expect portal gross profit will be similarly affected in the future if we are successful in winning new portal contracts 
we carefully monitor our portal gross profit percentage in an effort to balance generating a solid financial return and delivering value to our government partners through reinvestment in our portals 
cost of portal revenues in increased  or approximately million  over of this increase   or approximately million  was attributable to an increase in same state cost of portal revenues  and  or approximately million  was attributable to our newer state portal businesses  including kentucky and alabama 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in operating expenses from our local portals as a result of the continued wind down of certain of our unprofitable local portal businesses 
same state cost of portal revenues in increased  or approximately million  primarily as a result of the addition of personnel in several of our portals due to our continued growth and reinvestment in our core business 
also contributing to the increase in same state cost of portal revenues was an increase in bank fees  for reasons discussed above 
our portal gross profit rate increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to a full year of operations in from our kentucky portal  and to a modest improvement in our same state gross profit rate 
on a same state basis  our portal gross profit rate was  an increase of less than from while same state portal revenues grew by in  same state cost of portal revenues increased by approximately  as further discussed above 
software services revenues 
in the analysis below  we have categorized our software services revenues by business in thousands  with the corresponding percentage increase or decrease from the prior year period 

nic kxxjpg 
the decrease in software services revenues in primarily reflects the first quarter adjustment under percentage of completion accounting relating to our contract with the california secretary of state  which resulted in a million reduction in software services revenues  as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we recognize revenue on our contract with the california secretary of state using the percentage of completion method as we make progress  utilizing costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total cost for the contract 
software services revenues in decreased  or approximately million  from primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our ucc corporate filings software development business 
we recognized approximately million in revenue from our contract with the california secretary of state in compared to million in cost of software services revenues 
cost of software services revenues in includes a charge of million due to the effect of the adjustment under percentage of completion accounting relating to our contract with the california secretary of state as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the decrease in cost of software services revenues in was mostly due to a decrease in project costs incurred on our contract with the california secretary of state  and was relatively consistent with the corresponding decrease in project revenues as further discussed above 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we reversed approximately million in loss accruals relating to our legacy business filing contracts in arkansas and oklahoma  as these contracts were expected to cost less to complete than our previous estimates 
this adjustment positively affected our software services gross profit rate for additionally  in the first quarter of  we reduced our expected profit margin on our contract with the california secretary of state from approximately to due to an increase in estimated costs to complete the contract as a result of adding project management resources to the project 
this margin adjustment adversely affected our software services gross profit rate for selling administrative 
selling administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and for  and  respectively 
we expect selling administrative costs as a percentage of revenues to continue to decline modestly as our revenues grow and our corporate expenses increase modestly year over year 
interest income 
interest income reflects interest earned on our cash and marketable securities portfolio 
in  we began investing our excess cash in short term marketable debt securities  consisting primarily of auction rate government backed obligations 
our marketable securities portfolio totaled million at december  rising short term interest rates throughout also contributed to the increase in interest income earned on these investments 
equity in net loss of affiliates 
equity in net loss of affiliates represents our share of losses of companies in which we have had equity method investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investees 
in the first quarter of  we invested in two private companies involved in the egovernment services industry  tidemark and e filing  primarily for strategic purposes 
in may  a private technology company acquired tidemark 
we recognized a million gain in the second quarter of relating to our previous equity investment in tidemark 
in may  e filing repurchased the company s ownership interest in e filing for  which approximated the carrying value of the company s investment at the date of the repurchase 
the company had no investment balance remaining in e filing after the repurchase 
at december  and  we held no investments in affiliates or joint ventures accounted under the equity method 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in  in and in our income tax provision in was less than the amount customarily expected due primarily to deferred tax asset adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter of totaling a benefit of approximately million as more fully described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
prospectively  we expect our effective tax rate to be between and 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this improvement was partially the result of a year over year increase in operating income  excluding non cash charges and the million adjustment on our contract with the california secretary of state recorded under percentage of completion accounting  which did not affect operating cash flow in the effect of the adjustment relating to the california secretary of state contract on our consolidated balance sheets was a reduction in unbilled revenues of approximately million and an increase in application development contracts a current liability of approximately million 
the increase in accounts receivable and payable in the current period was partially attributable to a general increase in revenues across our portal businesses in  including our south carolina and colorado portals combined million increase in accounts receivable and million increase in accounts payable  which began to generate dmv revenues in june and october  respectively 
in addition  our virginia portal entered into a contract amendment in late that required it to become the primary depositor of customer remittances  whereas customer remittances were previously deposited directly with the state 
this change contributed to a million increase in accounts receivable and a corresponding increase in accounts payable in further  several of our state portals experienced an increase in fourth quarter tax payment processing from tax filing applications  including idaho million increase in accounts receivable and million increase in accounts payable and hawaii million increase in accounts payable  among others 
such tax payments are frequently made via ach or credit cards at the end of the year  whereby we do not receive payment until after year end 
the majority of these tax receipts were remitted to our government partners in early january net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this improvement was primarily the result of approximately million in milestone payments received from the california secretary of state and a year over year improvement in our operating income  excluding non cash charges 
these payments from the california secretary of state contributed to the decrease in unbilled revenues in we recognize revenues on this contract under percentage of completion accounting as progress is made on the project 
however  we do not receive regular progress payments from the california secretary of state  which contributes to fairly significant fluctuations in unbilled revenues each reporting period 
the increase in accrued expenses in was partially due to accrued subcontractor costs on this project  as we are not required to pay certain subcontractors until we receive major milestone payments under the contract 
approximately million of the milestone payments received in were paid to certain subcontractors during the year 
the decrease in accounts payable in was mainly attributable to the continued wind down of certain of our unprofitable local portal businesses during  as further discussed above 
we have a history of unprofitable operations prior to primarily due to operating losses incurred in our software services businesses 
these losses generated significant federal and state tax net operating losses  or nols  as further discussed below 
as a result of our nol carryforwards  we are not currently paying federal income taxes  with the exception of minimal amounts relating to alternative minimum tax  and are only paying minimal amounts of state income taxes in certain states 
this positively impacts our operating cash flow and will continue to positively impact our operating cash flow during the nol carryforward periods 
based on our current projections  we expect to fully utilize our federal nol carryforwards by the end of for the years ended december   and  combined federal and state income tax payments totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we recognize revenue primarily from providing outsourced government portal services net of the transaction fees due to the government when the services are provided 
the fees that the company must remit to the government are accrued as accounts payable and accounts receivable at the time services are provided 
as a result  trade accounts payable and accounts receivable reflect the gross amounts outstanding at the balance sheet dates 
gross billings for the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company calculates days sales outstanding by dividing trade accounts receivable at the balance sheet date by gross billings for the period and multiplying the resulting quotient by the number of days in that period 
days sales outstanding for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
we believe that working capital is an important measure of our short term liquidity 
working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  increased to million at december  from million at december  our current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  at december  was compared to at december  the increase in our working capital was primarily attributable to an increase in total cash and marketable securities as a result of the significant increase in our operating cash flow in cash used in investing activities in primarily reflects million in net purchases of marketable debt securities in an effort to increase the investment income from our growing cash reserves  and million of capital expenditures  which were for our new south carolina and colorado portals approximately million  in addition to normal fixed asset additions in our other outsourced portal business  including web servers  purchased software and office furniture and equipment 
investing activities in resulted in net cash used of million  reflecting million in capital expenditures  which were partially offset by the maturity of marketable securities and proceeds from the sale of our minority investment in e filing as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
capital expenditures in were mainly attributable to computer equipment purchases relating to our move to a new data center for company wide hosting and disaster recovery purposes  in addition to normal fixed asset additions in our portal business 
investing activities in resulted in net cash used of million for capital expenditures  which were primarily for normal fixed asset additions in our outsourced portal business  including web servers  purchased software and office furniture and equipment 
financing activities in resulted in net cash generated of approximately million  reflecting a million reduction in our cash collateral requirements under the financing arrangement that covers all of the company s outstanding letters of credit  as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
cash provided by financing activities in also reflects approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase program 
although we cannot predict the annual amount of proceeds we expect to receive from employee stock options in the future  we expect that our employees will continue to exercise vested stock options that have intrinsic value 
at december   approximately million employee stock options were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the closing price of our common stock on december  was per share 
financing activities in resulted in net cash generated of approximately million  reflecting a million reduction in our cash collateral requirements under the financing arrangement that covered all of the company s outstanding letters of credit  term note payable  which was paid off in  and working capital line of credit as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
financing activities in also reflect million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase program 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million in  primarily reflecting a million decrease in restricted cash to collateralize a bank note payable and certain bank letters of credit issued on behalf of the company  and million in payments on the note payable 
we received approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase program 
at december   our total unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance was million compared to million at december  at december   we had posted million in cash as collateral for bank letters of credit issued on behalf of the company 
however  as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  in april  the cash collateral requirements under our current banking agreement were eliminated  and we are no longer required to cash collateralize letters of credit 
we issue letters of credit as collateral for performance on certain of our government contracts  as collateral for certain performance bonds  and as collateral for certain office leases 
these irrevocable letters of credit are generally in force for one year 
our collateral requirements have eased over time as we have continued to operate profitably and grow our earnings 
however  even though we expect to be profitable in fiscal and beyond  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we will need to generate sufficient revenues while containing costs and operating expenses if we are to achieve sustained profitability 
if we are not able to sustain profitability  our cash collateral requirements may increase 
had we been required to post cash collateral at december  for the face value of all performance bonds which are partially supported by letters of credit and our line of credit in conjunction with a corporate credit card agreement  unrestricted cash would have decreased and restricted cash would have increased by approximately million 
we do not believe the million charge we recorded in the first quarter of relating to the california secretary of state project or the recent contract amendment that reduces the project scope will have a significant effect on our future liquidity 
we believe that our currently available liquid resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements  capital expenditure requirements  and current growth initiatives for at least the next twelve months without the need of additional capital 
however  we may need to raise additional capital before this period ends to further fund operations if unforeseen costs arise  including the costs to fund our contract with the california secretary of state and subcontractors on that project  collateralize letters of credit  which we are required to post as collateral for performance on certain of our outsourced government portal contracts  as collateral for certain performance bonds  and as collateral for certain office leases  support our expansion into other states and government agencies beyond what is contemplated if unforeseen opportunities arise  expand our product and service offerings beyond what is contemplated if unforeseen opportunities arise  respond to unforeseen competitive pressures  and acquire technologies beyond what is contemplated 
any projections of future earnings and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our unrestricted cash  marketable securities and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  issue debt securities  or increase our working capital line of credit 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
at december   we were bound by performance bond commitments totaling approximately million on certain government contracts 
of this amount  million relates to the performance bond on our contract with the california secretary of state  which is collateralized by a million letter of credit 
we have never had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements or significant exposures to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands 
nic kxxjpg 
deferred tax assets at december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  totaling approximately million 
we estimate that we must generate at least million of future taxable income to realize those deferred tax assets 
to achieve a sufficient level of future taxable income  we intend to continue to pursue our current strategy of adding new government partners  broadening our service offerings in our existing government portals  and increasing transactional revenues from our existing government portals 
based on information currently known to management  we believe it is more likely than not that the company will realize the deferred tax assets 
the table below reconciles income before income taxes for financial statement purposes with taxable income before net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in thousands 
nic kxxjpg 
the taxable income for federal income tax purposes includes deductible temporary differences 
as of december   our net deductible temporary differences  exclusive of net operating loss carryforwards  total approximately million 
our federal income tax loss carryforward of approximately million expires as follows million expires in  million expires in and million expires in our state income tax loss carryforwards of approximately million may be used over various periods ranging from to years 
we are currently paying state income taxes in certain states 
in addition  we are currently paying federal alternative minimum tax as a result of alternative minimum tax net operating loss deduction limits 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  that requires companies to expense the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the use of the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  that we currently use to account for our stock based compensation plans 
sfas no 
r is effective for annual periods beginning after june  we will be required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of we currently expect to use the modified prospective transition method  which would not require us to restate our financial statements prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
for vested stock option awards that are outstanding on january   the modified prospective method would not require us to record any additional compensation expense 
for unvested stock option awards that are outstanding on january   awards that were previously included as part of the pro forma net income and earnings per share calculations of sfas no 
would be charged to expense over the remaining vesting period  without any changes in measurement 
for all new stock option awards that are granted or modified after january   we would use sfas no 
r s measurement model  expense recognition  and settlement provisions 
based solely on the expected remaining unrecognized fair value of currently outstanding stock option awards we estimated for purposes of preparing our current sfas no 
pro forma disclosures see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  the effect of adopting sfas no 
r in on net income is expected to be approximately million 
we believe that equity based compensation  like stock options  will continue to play an important role in supporting employee retention and providing individuals with long term incentives to meet company goals 
we will consider granting stock options to directors and employees in the future with exercise prices equal to then current market prices 
as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  on october   our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested options to purchase common stock of the company that had an exercise price that was greater than the market price on that date 
the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market on october  was per share 
as a condition of the acceleration and to prevent unintended personal benefit  the company s directors  executive officers and employees must refrain from selling common stock acquired upon the exercise of accelerated options until the original vesting date or  if earlier  termination of employment with or service to the company 
all other terms and conditions applicable to such options  including exercise prices  remain unchanged 
this action resulted in the accelerated vesting of options to purchase  shares of common stock of the company  or approximately six percent of the total of all then outstanding company options 
we accelerated the vesting of these options because we believed it was in the best interest of our shareholders to reduce future compensation expense that we would otherwise be required to report in our statement of income upon adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of further  because the options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price  they are viewed to have limited economic value and are not fully achieving their objective of incentive compensation and retention 
currently  we account for stock options using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
and provide pro forma footnote disclosure of the compensation expense associated with stock options as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
as a result of the vesting acceleration  approximately million in aggregate future expense will be eliminated over the next three fiscal years 
the vesting acceleration did not result in compensation expense in the company s statement of income  but is reflected as additional stock based employee compensation expense in the calculation of pro forma earnings in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our short term investments in marketable debt securities and cash balances 
because our investments are in short term  investment grade  interest bearing marketable securities  we are exposed to minimal risk on the principal of those investments 
we limit our exposure to credit loss by depositing our cash with high credit quality financial institutions 
we enhance the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by attempting to limit default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
